It still displays UTF-16 in the stash diff, using the attributes listed above in the current version.

I couldn't reproduce this; sometimes the auto-detection of the encoding was a little flaky when you didn't have much text in the file, but if you save the file as UTF-16 with BOM it detected it every time and displayed the text diff. I didn't get a binary file display in my tests. This is with 1.3.1.
