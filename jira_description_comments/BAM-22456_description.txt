h3. Issue Summary

Currently, when a Bamboo job fails and is retried, the artifacts from the failed job are deleted. This makes it very difficult to troubleshoot flaky test failures in a setup where failed jobs are automatically retried.
h3. Requested Change

Preserve the artifacts from a failed Bamboo job if that job is retried.
