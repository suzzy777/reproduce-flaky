Hi everyone,
Thank you for previously raising this bug and bringing it to our attention.

Within our company roadmap and work capacity, we try to address or review each bug request but admit that not each one will be resolved. To continue the culture of being honest and open, we are closing this bug to focus on our upcoming roadmap for all Confluence users.

As we continue to roll out features we do look at requests made by our users and if you feel like this bug is still impacting your team please let us know.

Thank you again for providing valuable feedback to our team!
