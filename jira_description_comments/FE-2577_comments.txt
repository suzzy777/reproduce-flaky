As we have been moving to a GWT admin ui, we have been experiencing the same problem when writing our own functional tests.

{panel:title=Atlassian Update â€“ 5 October 2018|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#00B8D9|titleBGColor=#00B8D9}Hi everyone,

We have recently reviewed this issue and the overall interest in the problem. As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.

Although we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Fisheye&Crucible team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Implementation of New Features Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/implementation-of-new-features-policy-201294576.html] for more details.

We understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.

Regards
Marek Parfianowicz
Fisheye/Crucible TL{panel}
