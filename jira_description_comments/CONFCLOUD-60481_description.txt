Confluence is expecting a 'label' property in property-panel-macro.js but is getting a 'name' one instead, causing a `can't read property 'value'` of defined exception that is stopping the custom properties panel from popping up [*I would attach a screenshot but something is up with attachments at the moment*].

There was a commit at one point with matching changes in connect, but these seem to have been reverted somehow.

Breaking changes relate to [CRA-1214|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CRA-1214]
