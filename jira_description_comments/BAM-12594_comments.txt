Thanks for reporting [~gstewart@soundbite.com]. To clarify, do you want to see them across Plan Branches or Plans? We had a similar issue reported recently but asking for this functionality across Branches.

I would like it across plans.  We do not use Plan Branches because we use Perforce.
We have a plan for each branch and for each environment.  So if we have the following branches:
main
Dev1
Dev2

and two separate environments to build for we have 6 plans

main env1
main env2
Dev1 env1
Dev1 env2
Dev2 env1
Dev2 env2

I want to know if the test is failing on all 6 plans, only on the env2 plans, only on the Dev1 plans, etc.  I would also like to the the success rate on the plans because that would also tell me if the test if flaky and is their a pattern to the flakiness.

There are times when I would like a report for a single unit test, to see it's history across branches.  It would help me to find a unit test that only fails between 6pm and 11 pm, for instance.  I'd like to see the failure message to see if they are failing for the same reason on multiple branches.

Currently we are working on a failing test that only fails in env2.  It is a test of threading behavior. The junit error message gives us information about the decision metrics in the threads.  Seeing all the failure messages across plans would give us more data in understanding the bug.


Thanks for the very detailed reply Gail.

For the record - I'm moving to sonar for reports like this  - while you are adding features to Bamboo you are neglecting reports.  Reports make the results actionable.
