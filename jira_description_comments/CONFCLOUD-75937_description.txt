h3. Issue Summary

All of these popups had transparent backgrounds (see attachment) as it has 100% width+height but use a 2% margin so the user can still see the Confluence editor behind the dialog.

Now those backgrounds are all white (see attachment). 
Setting width/height to less than 100% results in a dialog chrome/header.
The culprit is the CSS for {{.aui.dialog2.content}}
