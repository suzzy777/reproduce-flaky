Same problem after upgrade from JIRA 7.3.0 to 7.4.2.

Guys, do you know if this issue was fixed in version 7.5.0? Many people that use this feature in a big client are complaining that now they can't print multiple issues.

 

Regards,

Please fix!

Issue is also present in our 7.8 instance. Please fix!

Could you please help, I have set up a Quick Filter in my Active SCRUM Board, and all the 'Issue Types' i want to print are displayed as expected, however when i select the print cards it ONLY prints the issues which have no sub-task defined, all Stories which have Sub Task do not get printed unless i do them individually which is just a waste of time and paper?

Is there some other configuration behind the 'print cards' command?

Also when will this Ticket be fixed?? surely this is basic functionality to JIRA??

Issue is present in v7.11. A fix is appreciated since the bug complicates a couple of workflow tasks a lot.

For an Agile project with a physical board, this is very annoying!

Issue is present in 7.12.0.

Observation: I can *sometimes* select multiple contiguous cards using shift-click, but control-click never works. Instead, it de-selects all but the last card. Very flaky behavior. Testing was done on Chrome, Jira v7.10, Kanban board.

In the version 7.5.1, we can print multiple cards from active sprint, but not from the backlog view.

Adding that the issue is still present in 7.12.3

The reference documentation indicates that you can perform the process as indicated above.
