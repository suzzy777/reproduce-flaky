The problem is that the test contains a race condition:

{code:java}
private void commitChange(final User user, final String commitMessage) throws Exception
{
    WebTesterUtils.setApplication(webTester, Application.FISHEYE);
    SvnUtils.commitFiles(user.getUserName(), user.getPassword(), projectName, commitMessage, new SvnSetup(StudioFuncTest.getInstance()).getUrl(),
            "Test" + System.currentTimeMillis() + ".java");
    new FisheyeSetup(StudioFuncTest.getInstance()).scanRepository(projectName);
    // Wait 1 second for the scan to complete and for the commit notifications to be processed on
    // JIRA
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    WebTesterUtils.setApplication(webTester, Application.JIRA);
}
{code}

Sleeping for a second doesn't guarantee that the scan actually completed.
