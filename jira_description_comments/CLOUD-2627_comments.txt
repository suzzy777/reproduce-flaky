This test seems to have failed a second or two before the last entries in the product log files, like the applications were in the process of shutting down when this test was run.

I have committed a fix (r63879) for the NPEs that are appearing in the Bamboo log file, and could be causing failure like this (REST calls failing).

This is still failing occasionally: https://bamboo.extranet.atlassian.com/browse/SFT-CONFSTABLESNAP-JOB1-9/test/case/149817431

This appears to be a timing issue.

The {{setUp()}} code is like this:
{code}bambooPlan.execute();
bambooPlan.waitForCompleteBuild();
SvnUtils.modifyFile(...);
bambooPlan.execute();{code}

The logic in Bamboo's {{ExecuteBuild}}:
{code}if (!buildFromContainer.isInBuildQueue()) {
    buildExecutionManager.startManualBuild(buildFromContainer, getSessionUser(getAuth()));
}{code}

But the logic in Bamboo's {{LocalBuildResultProcessor}} saves the build result to database before removing the build from the build queue.

From the log:
{noformat}2010-11-10 18:45:57,315 INFO [BAM::Default::Agent:pool-7-thread-1] [SaveBuildTask] Saving build results to disk...
...
2010-11-10 18:45:58,465 INFO [BAM::Events:pool-1-thread-9] [BuildCompletedEventListener] Running build post actions 'Bamboo Integration Project BAMINTDNYR - Trunk'{noformat}

The first line was logged when the build result was saved to the database while the last line was logged before the build is removed from the build queue. And there is more than a second between.

So when {{setUp}} received the first build result (successful or failed), it proceeded to start the next build. However, since the build was still in the build queue, the build request was ignored.

Added 5 seconds wait between the two manual build, as there seems to be no restful way to query the build state of a particular build key or any way to retrieve the latest build key for a build plan.

We should raise this with the Bamboo team, then.

BTW great investigation work!
