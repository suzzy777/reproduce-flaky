The Java Applet that makes the Screenshot upload possible doesn't send the crowd.token.key cookie on the POST request, so the file never gets attached and no error message is displayed, the user just notices that no file is attached.
This option is accessible through the 'More Actions'->'Attach Screenshot' menu on a JIRA issue.
