Page labels have higher z-index than an inline comment. As a result they are being rendered over the comment, with surprising results - you can get a label inside an input field for a new comment. See the attached screen shot.

It's a bit flaky. Usually page height is extended so that labels are rendered under the last comment. Sometimes labels just jump up on their own - I suspect that some page elements are being lazy-loaded. If not, try making some action on the page, e.g. reply to a comment under a page, click like, scroll page to the right to bounce it etc. It looks like it sometimes rearranges elements on the page or modifies page width which results in this behaviour.

I'm not sure if slowing down network speed could help in reproducing this.
