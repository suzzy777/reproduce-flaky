We are expecting ETA on this as most of our customers are affected by this. 

This issue is critical to us because it is impacting multiple features.

Hello - the fix has been reviewed and approved. It should be released within the next 1-2 days and I will update the status of this issue when that happens. Thanks!

The fix has been released. Thanks for your patience.

I am seeing a regression on this issue today. Anyone else?

[~b5f5591b267d] could you provide an example? Maybe a screenshot? Which app/macro?

I am referring to the broader issue in ECOHELPPUB-64 that was merged into this issue, so it's not just editor macros. The regression started some time within the last 24 hours, according to screenshots captured by our synthetic tests.

It was also breaking consistently for me manually when I made my most recent comment, even despite hard-reloading page and clearing cache. However, I see that it just now flipped over to displaying correctly without the border.

Did this get manually fixed, or is there something flaky going on? This screenshot example ([https://imgur.com/aZoLgQg|https://imgur.com/aZoLgQg]) was generated by installing Cenote Lockpoint, adding an Attachments macro, and clicking "Lock" on an attachment. The screenshot is from automated tests that ran ~30 minutes ago (2023-06-12 12:47 pm UTC-4).

I seen it too, it was even worse than before due to this new max-height rule messing up our full screen editor content.

It's fine now though, someone must have noticed ;)

...and now it's back to being broken again.

I can confirm that broken CSS containing
{code:java}
.aui-dialog2 { /* ... */ background-color: #fff; }
{code}
is currently being served live from the following URL:

[https://d2cyaw4z41y1zi.cloudfront.net/MYSITENAME.atlassian.net/wiki/s/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e-CDN/-1323341750/h/c808f4ec844c1e86a2e646a62cf53cae/_/download/batch/com.atlassian.auiplugin:dialog2/com.atlassian.auiplugin:dialog2.css?assetVersion=1000.0.0-156dd3baa532&externals=__local-default__&relative-url=true]

The returned CSS assets seem to be different depending on what you put for MYSITENAME, though. The broken CSS is currently being delivered for one of the three test sites I use, whereas if I sub in two other site names for MYSITENAME, that returned CSS does not specify the background-color.

Thanks [~b5f5591b267d] for the additional info. I can now reproduce this on my side too. It is indeed a regression of this particular issue but now due to a different reason :( and due to totally unfortunate ironic timing. Another team within Confluence is working on upgrading AUI in Confluence from its long resting state of v6.x to v7.x and then to v8x over the coming months. The change that you saw today includes the bump to v7.x and explains a difference in the `.aui-dialog2` `background-color` and also the `max-height`. We believe some of these will need updates from app developers that are specific to app use-cases while others will warrant Confluence-provided overrides (specifically the background color in this case). 

lol classic Atlassian. They've also included max-height which is now causing all the macro editors to not be full height...
{code:java}
.aui-dialog2-content {   
  background-color: #fff;   
  box-sizing: border-box;  
  overflow: auto;    
  padding: 20px; 
  max-height: calc(100vh - 314px);
} {code}
@Alex that's not something devs can fix/override on our end. 

The max-height problem is critical for our apps.

Has Atlassian already started fixing it?
I think the impact is significant. So will an incident in [https://confluence.status.atlassian.com/] be created?

This is much worse than before due to the max height change. Please roll back ASAP.

 

How did you not test this after it was literally broken just a few days ago?

Sorry to bump, but this has broken the paid-for Confluence plugin *draw.io* which my company relies on :(

Can the change please be rolled back?

Same for me and my colleagues. We cannot use draw.io either. Also paid version and critical for our work!

Can someone please pick this up asap?

Thanks

Not working for me either. This ticket should be reopened with highest priority, considering the fact that the prior fix has caused a regression and a LOT of customers are being impacted because of this.

Please fix the problem, we pay for draw.io which is absolutely important for us and affected by your fix. It can´t be used under this circumstances!

Hi all - the Confluence Cloud team is aware of this recent regression and it is being addressed with urgency. This new problem is not a regression of this fix but rather an ironic timing of an upgrade to AUI 7.x within Confluence Cloud which is included in https://developer.atlassian.com/changelog/#CHANGE-983.

We will address both the `max-height` and the `background-color` for dialogs with a fix. Please follow https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-75996 for this new issue.
