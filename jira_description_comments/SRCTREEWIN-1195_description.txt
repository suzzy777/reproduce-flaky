SourceTree used to allow diffing utf-16 in UI but it does not work anymore.  It was accomplished using the following in .gitattributes:

[attr]utf16 diff merge -crlf
*.sj utf16

I have an old version installed (.9.2.3) where it would read this and would display in the viewer panel, allowing all the associated functionality.  Can this be fixed?  I'd rather not convert the files to UTF-8 or stay on the old version.  This declaration works fine for other external viewers, it tells git to treat the file as text.
