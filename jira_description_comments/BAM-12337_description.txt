In the Stash team, we sometimes uses the _Re-run failing builds_ option to fix a red build to make it green and allows its dependent builds (like _Stash Deploy_) to run.

However when doing so, we loose the name(s) of the flaky test(s) that was or were failing. As a developer, it would be intuitive if Bamboo would record a list of tests that were failing but became green after a build re-run. The list could also contain a link to the re-run builds for each test, although that's optional.

This would permit a team of developers to have a list of known flaky tests that they can fix, and make it part of the team workflow.
