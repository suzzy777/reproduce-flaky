I don&#x27;t want to commit and push.  I have modified some code on my local.  I want to verify, if all the tests pass, with out doing the commit.  Is there a way to upload a diff to the pipelines.

Basically, I should upload my local changes or changesets with out commit and push.  This helps to avoid lot of unnecessary commits or experimental commits.

Sometimes, webdriver tests are very flaky.  We make changes and the changes should be pushed for testing on the bitbucket pipelines.
