This would be a very helpful improvement for us! And I would imagine a lot of other teams would appreciate it as well.

In our process, we use Slack channels for most of the communication around issues while they are in progress. Prior to starting development work on an issue, most of the communication is in the Jira issue itself (description updates, updating various fields, some comments, linking it to other information like mockups, Confluence pages, etc.), however, once development and testing is going on, the vast majority of the daily "chatter" about an issue happens in a Slack channel dedicated to that issue (only top-level issues like Stories and Bugs; we don't use Slack channels for sub-tasks).

The improvement that Marcelo described would be perfect for us. As it is today, we have to manually create channels (making sure they conform to a certain naming standard in order for other automations to work), add people interested in the issue, and use the "Connect to Slack" action in the issue to hook the issue up to the channel. People often forget to do that, or don't add the right people, or give the channel the wrong name. It would be very helpful if we had some way of just hooking up the automatic channel creating to an issue transition.

For a couple years, we had a third-party Jira app that we managed to make do this (with some custom scripting on our part), but it was flaky, and late last year, completely broke and the vendor declined to fix it.

Thank for your consideration!
