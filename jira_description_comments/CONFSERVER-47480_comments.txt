We will temporarily mark all ODATs with @Ignore annotation. Once our tests become stable again in the Main build we will re-introduce them to the pipeline.

Thanks [~ttranminh], any further updates on this? Do you have a branch or any builds related to this? It looks like this test has started passing in Qualify.

Please make sure any pull requests get made against the "release/confluence-cloud-5.9.1-OD-2015.45" branch.


[~ttranminh], do you have any details on a root cause as to why the tests failed? If we ignore the tests, will that mean possible bugs are pushed through the pipeline, or was the problem with the test itself?


Tests were verified by the guys locally, they are flaky.



This is no longer a blocker for confluence-cloud-5.9.1-OD-2015.45
