To create tests quickly, we need transparent unmarshalling of data objects, instead of parsing the serialized strings using the JSON API. This is stalled at the moment as XStream (used in unit tests) expects different JSON formatting than what Jersey currently produces. This is posted to the XStream user list:

A number of unit tests exit, but since Jersey's JSON support is a bit flaky at the moment, I am closing this issue. Adding a test for every resource is problematic as long as Jersey's output is not 100% consistent and reliable.
