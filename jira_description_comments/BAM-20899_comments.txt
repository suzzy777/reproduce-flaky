This behaviour is by design. 
Could you please tell me more about your use case, why do you think this should be implemented?

On the master branch we have several issues that are known issues, which we put in quarantine (and link to a Jira issue). In previous version of Bamboo (<7.0.x) if we started a new branch plan, those quarantined tests are correctly inhered. In that way, the developer of the branch is not confronted with the known issues. Now with 7.0.x the failing tests are just marked as failed (not even "Failing in develop" is displayed anymore). Therefor it is not clear what issues are introduced in the branch, and the check in Bitbucket prevent from merging the branch.

Is the design of quarantine changed in 7.0, or what is now the intent of the quarantine?

We have the exact same scenario as mentioned above. We have a few flaky tests that need a lot of effort to get fixed. As an interim solution, we made tickets for every one and marked them as quarantined. This is especially important for branches â€“ why should every single branch see all those tests fail? No reason.

With Bamboo 7 this now broke, and is a major roadblock for us. If this is intended behavior (cannot see why anyone would want that), please add an option to disable this ASAP.

Same result as @Max and @Peter except with YML Specs. The old behavior was useful and sensible. I have to assume the new behavior is a bug because it is neither.
