h3. Issue Summary

When a [Divergent Plan Branch|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/working-with-branch-divergence-994314811.html] is created, the Quarantined Tests in the main plan (e.g. master), are not inherited, so the test is not put in quarantine in the newly created Plan Branches.

(i)Â This occurs both YAML and Java Specs, but only with Divergent Branches (Bamboo > 7.0)
h3. Steps to Reproduce
 # create a plan using Java/YAML _Specs_, with the first repository in the repositories list being that same Specs repository.
 # create a failed test
 # add the test to Quarantine
 # Create a Plan branch

h3. Expected Results

The Plan branch should inherit the Quarantined Test
h3. Actual Results

The Quarantined Tests are not inherited
h3. Workaround

Manually add the failed test to Quarantine or have any repository other than the Specs one be the #1 in the repository list.
