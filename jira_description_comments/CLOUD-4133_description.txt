AOD-4093 removed a test from this test class because the test was unclear, flaky, and no longer testing what it was originally intended to test.

The Crucible permission scheme synchronisation process should be tested more thoroughly (and all options - create and update of a permission scheme for an existing project) should be exercised.

To do this, the test class should probably be moved out of the simple tests group and should implement a custom setup that sets up projects (and hence permission schemes) which allow testing of all request paths through CrucibleGlobalAdminServlet (for 'permissions' requests).
