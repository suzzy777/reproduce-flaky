The fields (defaultModerator, defaultReviewers) are not being rendered on the screen. These is probably the reason why TestCrucibleGlobalAdmin is failing.

I re-tested the TestCreateReview.testCreateReviewInDefaultProject and it seems to be working now. Maybe a flaky test?



The macro signature of userPicker was changed in JIRA 4.2 with the unused formName parameter removed.
