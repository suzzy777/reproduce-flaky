I've included some debug info on the test class to try to understand better what is causing the flakiness. 
It looks like the application context is getting messed up on the test context, I tried to simulate some weird scenarios and didn't get the exact same failure.
For some reason on the failing test, the gotoPage("/") instead of going to FishEye's context root (http://localhost:3990/) is going to CRU (http://localhost:3990/source)

This is the piece of HTML that was returned on the page source that got retrieved after the gotoPage("/").

  <input name="os_destination" type="hidden" value="/source/" />

It looks like it's still failing:
