No, the timeout is not the problem, I've analysed the test failures and they are all due to the emails never being sent.  In every case, the conflicts the test was supposed to find were considered existing conflicts, not new conflicts.  This was due to the JIRA import triggering the sync job to run mid import, which would register conflicts, no email would be sent though because during the refresh no mail server was configured (or running), then the test would start and configure a mail server, and trigger the conflict situation, this would be detected but not emailed because that user was already marked as being in a conflicted state from the mid import sync.  Alex is currently fixing something that should also fix this.
