Many functional tests are still failing and have never worked with initial data.

Robin made quite a bit of progress fixing functional tests a couple of iterations ago, and we were hoping that the remaining failures would automatically get fixed once the jira fisheye plugin was working. However, this has not been the case, and there are still many tests failing consistently (+ a handful of flaky tests).

Given that there are so many failing tests, I haven't created a separate task for each one. Upon further investigation, we may be able to split this task into more logical sub-tasks (hopefully there are only a few root causes causing multiple tests to fail).
