For some workflow implementation and customer requirements it would be good to implement the possibility of adding a global property to the entire workflow, which persists all over transitions.

For instance, I could add jira.permission.comment.projectrole to disable comments whilst in a transition but customer suggestion is to add the possibility to apply it to the entire workflow so that it can persist over all transitions.

Another possibility suggested by the customer would be to add the property directly in the transition, so that the transition could be used to allow/disallow comments.

As per customer comment: 


{code:java}
I would therefore like to propose that we can apply this property on a transition and the property would persist across transitions.  This way I could create an Anywhere to Itself transition called "Disable comments" that would apply this property another called "Enable comments" that would remove.  This, in a nutshell, is what I am requesting.
