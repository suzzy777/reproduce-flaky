Customers trying to setup a new connection to GitHub are unable to connect, receiving and Error: Invalid user/team account.

The reason for this is due to rate-limiting that GitHub has in place. Un-authenticated requests are limited to 1 per second per IP address over a 1 minute period. Outbound connections in OnDemand share squid proxies. There are two per rack meaning that approximately 1000 instances share a single outbound IP.

During busy periods, the rate limit means that customers are seeing error pages when they enable Github DVCS connector syncing.

We need to adjust the DVCS connector so that it takes account of this fact.
