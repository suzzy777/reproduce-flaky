This seems to happen randomly in some tests accessing view profile, and doesn't really have that much of an impact on the stability of the test suite. Attempts to reproduce in local dev environment unsuccessful. Putting on hold unless proven that it's really critical.

I moved {{TestExternalUserFunctionality.googleUserShouldNotBeAbleToEditProfile()}} to the flaky group. Please move it back when this is fixed.

Now that it's in the flaky group, it seems to actually fail in the same way pretty consistently.

There is a chance that this is caused by Streams interrupting a thread reading from Lucene index, which causes NIO channel exceptions and corrupts the index reader. Still investigating.

NIO is not the cause here. We're getting closer to figuring out what's happening. The index from failed runs shows no issues and the one from green runs shows one.

Root cause is that XML used to restore data in func tests has custom index path. After the restore the index reader used on user profile to render the assigned issues fragment is stale and tries to read from old location. Immediate fix to remove the flakiness would be to remove the custom index location from XML, but I want to investigate further since it still looks like a legitimate bug in JIRA.

Off for next two days, assigning to James and have introduced him to the latest findings via email.

Of course, the obvious happened - since we instrumented this, there have been no test failures....there is definitely still an indexing issue though - the log is full of corrupt index messages.

There is underlying logging code that needs to be reverted when satisfied that the problem has been found -

James, where are we at with this issue today?

I have removed the logging code, there hasn't been a failure since we added this - if this passes 3 or 4 builds in a row, I propose to close it as Cannot Reproduce, or to put it on hold...

We have tried everything to reproduce this failure - all to no avail.  I have removed all the logging code, and am marking as cannot reproduce.

Happened again here: https://bamboo.extranet.atlassian.com/browse/JST-JST-SIMPLE-641/

Assuming this has been fixed. If not, please open a new issue on SDOG with a link to a recent failure.
