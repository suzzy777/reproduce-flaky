We currently struggle with Quarantines for 2 reasons:

1) Quarantines are inherited from the "master" or main bamboo branch.  If your branch is from a previous release or not quite up to date, your inherited quarantines are likely wrong and you have to wait for at least one failed build to quarantine them.

2) Not all tests fail consistently.  Even if you know a test is flaky, and should be quarantined, you cannot quarantine it until it fails.

Both of these could be helped by allowing manual quarantining of tests whether or not they have ever failed.
