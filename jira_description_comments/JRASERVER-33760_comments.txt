[~edalgliesh] I'm not sure if I have set the right fix version on this one.

This PR is now merged in. I will be watching the builds now: https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/JIRA/repos/jira/pull-requests/95/overview

UNit tests are green: https://jira-bamboo.internal.atlassian.com/browse/MASTERONE-UNIT-6038

It looks like the func tests will fail due to previous builds being red: https://jira-bamboo.internal.atlassian.com/browse/MASTERONE-CIFUNCHAL

The main build basically succeeded, there was only one test and it looked flaky. https://jira-bamboo.internal.atlassian.com/browse/MASTERONE-CIFUNCHAL-4046

[~ohernandez@atlassian.com] I am going to make the crucible review now.

[~ohernandez@atlassian.com] The review has begun: https://atlaseye.atlassian.com/cru/CR-JRA-1657

Can we move this back into Quality Review time?
