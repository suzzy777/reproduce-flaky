Thanks for the feedback.

I&#x27;ll open this issue to gauge the interest of other users on this issue. However, the team is currently working on other higher priority features, so this isn&#x27;t something that we will look into any time soon.


OK, so: +1 :-)

This is a required feature when like me you deploy in china and the timeouts are frequent :-(

And there is a lot more use cases when it will be useful

Plus, I guess the codebase to implement this feature shouldn&#x27;t be very hard or very time consuming isn&#x27;t it ?


Issue BCLOUD-18551 was marked as a duplicate of this issue.


Given the low interest on this ticket since it's been raised, this isn't something that we plan to support in the near future. I'm going to close this ticket as won't do. 

Can you please consider reopening this ticket? I am sure there are a lot of people that need it but just haven't been actively following this thread

I dont understand why it is a low interest ticket. Github has it, Gitlab has it.  Please reconsider this, sometimes there are external deploy/test processes that will fail randomly (Like deploy to GCP). To manually rerun is really annoying.

This is a highly desired feature for us. I've had this at every other work place I've been and its saved the team a tonne of effort.

We will end up writing a wrapper script to work around this that will do the retries for us, but that is not a great end-state.

Please consider re-opening.

Now that this is back to the gathering interest status, how much interest do we need to gather to get this in development?

I don't know how this is not a standard feature yet.

This definitely should be a feature. I've had a couple of pipelines fail with connectivity issues that require a re-run to pass. This can be frustrating to developers who rely on pipelines to pass tests on pull requests when it appears their pull request has a fault, but it's really just the Pipeline falling over randomly.

 

It lacks consistency which means it looks unreliable.

Would love to be able to allow X automatic retries on a certain step in my pipeline. This could prevent a bunch of false-positive test failures on PRs etc. for one of the steps I know to be flaky.

The Bitbucket team's response to this is ridiculous in my opinion. Their first statement was: "Given the low interest on this ticket since it's been raised, this isn't something that we plan to support in the near future. I'm going to close this ticket as won't do."

1. As this thread shows, there's a ton of interest, and has only been gaining interest for the last 5 years.
2. Regardless of getting this feedback from users, this is a laughably obvious feature that any CI/CD product should offer. Their product design team should not need this much hand-holding for a basic functionality.
3. Given that their pipelines fail many times because of their own connectivity issues, etc., this gives them an easy opportunity to mask their own other limitations and problems. So kills 2 birds with 1 stone.
4. I don't know their codebase, etc., but I cannot imagine how or why this should be difficult to implement. It should be easy to introduce a new key that users can use in their pipeline steps for specifying the maximum number of auto-retries upon failure. They can reuse the logic that exists for when a user manually retries failed steps.

Overall, highly disappointed.

+1 If rerunning is manually possible, why not an automatic feature, always with max retries as suggested.

Agree with this being a very useful feature

So often when I search for how to do something obvious with Bitbucket pipelines I end up finding a 5 year+ old unresolved issue.
