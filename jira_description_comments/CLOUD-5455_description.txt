Original issue: [AOD-1169|https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/AOD-1169]

It's testing com.atlassian.studio.confluence.upgrade.UpgradeTo_v18 which seems to create the people directory information for users retrieved by com.atlassian.confluence.user.UserAccessor.getUsersWithConfluenceAccessAsList(). Crowd, JIRA and Confluence get restored (re-imported) on setup, so this might be a timing issue between user creation in Crowd and synchronisation with Confluence.
