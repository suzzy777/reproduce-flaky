h3. Issue Summary

PIR - [https://ops.internal.atlassian.com/jira/browse/PIR-13136]

We currently have some tests for dynamic macros. We also observed that one test was skipped because it was flaky. We need to re-enable all tests & ensure coverage is good for dynamic macros. One such existing, flaky test can be found at [https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/browse/next/devtools/ecosystem-tests/tests/ap-methods/dynamic-macros-test.js] and has been skipped for more than 6 months (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFDEV-79779) which includes a test for a dynamic macro verifying a nested macro renders correctly.

We should also add tests for bodied macros that checks if content of bodied macros is rendered correctly. Ideally a test like this would have caught this issue, but these tests can get very specific. As part of this PIR action, we should also review test coverage for Confluence capabilities for vendors.

[~obeztsinnyi@atlassian.com] has defined the test case well here: [https://atlassian.slack.com/archives/C043KN3L9T6/p1664219875858089?thread_ts=1664217820.777479&cid=C043KN3L9T6]
