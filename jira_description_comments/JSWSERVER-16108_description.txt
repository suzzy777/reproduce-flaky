# Please click your Board's Board (top right) -> Configure -> Quick filter.
# From the quick filter, please add a filter which includes specific issue keys that you would like to print (eg: *issuekey in (TEST-1, TEST-2)*).
# Switch back to backlog view click on the newly created quick filter and click Board -> Print cards. This should allow you to print all the issues which is listed in the filter.
