The problem in particular is that indexing an issue in JIRA happens due to an event listener listening to an issue event.  Publishing webhooks also happens as the result of an event listener listening to an issue event.  The order in which listeners get notified of these events is not deterministic however! So it can happen that sometimes the webhook publisher will be notified first and try to run the JQL filter *before* the issue has been reindexed!

Steps to reproduce:
* Setup a webhook with JQL filter
* Setup a listener for the webhook so you can check if the webhook gets sent (I just used tcpmon to proxy the request from port 8989 to port 80 on my local box)
* Create an issue (or whatever) to trigger the webhook

*Sometimes* no webhook will be sent.  You can also simulate this by setting a breakpoint in the IssueIndexListener, thus simulating a slow index operation.
