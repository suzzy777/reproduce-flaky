This fix did not make it into 2.7.1. It will be addressed in a later release.

The fix for CONF-12940 set the draft to null. However it turns out we need to create a new draft so that confluence has something to attach images to.

This has been fixed.

I tried to write a Selenium test, but there were various problems
* Firefox does not allow file upload boxes to be manipulated via javascript
* CONF-13159 Attachments can't be added to a draft (in rpc anyway)

I've added a test that makes sure that the draft is reset properly, but it's pretty flaky.

Changes look good.

This can still easily be reproduced, by doing the steps given in a slightly different order:


# you goto create page
# then upload an image 
# then you click 'discard draft'
# then preview it



If we can't come up with a non-risky solution for 2.10 we should consider pushing this back for 3.0 bugfixing where we can fix this properly if necessary. If it's agreed, I'll kick it to 3.0 and get it off the 2.10 list.

I'm unscheduling this issue because to fix this we would need to make wholesale changes to how Drafts work in Confluence.

I''ve increased the complexity to reflect this. I've also dropped the value because the bug in the description has been fixed, and the remaining bug is a smaller edge case.

Hi

Thanks for taking the time to raise this issue. As you are no doubt aware this issue has been on our backlog for some time now with very little movement. 

As this ticket not been touched within the last two years we are closing of this issue as we have more current and higher prioritised issues that we are focusing on. 

I'm going to close this to set expectations so the issue doesn't stay open for years with few updates. If demand for this picks up, we will reopen the issue.
