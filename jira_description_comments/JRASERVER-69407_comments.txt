Just to provide some background to this issue as I don't think the description describes the requirement that clearly.

We raise literally hundreds of incidents a day.  Some will be as straight forward as "I can't login" or "network in office xyz is flaky".  But a few are a lot more serious, such as "Outlook is down".  In all cases those working on the incident communicate updates by commenting on the issue, developing a thread of tests and changes as they go along.

The problem is that users also like to chime in with their comments, a common refrain is "I have this issue too".  In the case of an Outlook outage this can (and has) result in hundreds of comments that simply hide the important comments.  What would be useful is the ability to limit comments to the technicians for the duration of the investigation.

At this point I expect people to chime in and say, "but Jira already has this", so let me explain more.  Yes, Jira does already have this (the ability to upload an attachment would be really useful here, but this is disabled for some reason, although I can add a smiley as if this is useful (n)).  I can create a status to "park" the issue and apply the property "jira.permission.comment.projectrole =  10001" to restrict comments to a specific role.  All well and good if there is a single status where I need to suppress comments, but where I may want to suppress comments at any stage of the workflow this would become too complex.

I would therefore like to propose that we can apply this property on a transition and the property would persist across transitions.  This way I could create an Anywhere to Itself transition called "Disable comments" that would apply this property another called "Enable comments" that would remove.  This, in a nutshell, is what I am requesting.
