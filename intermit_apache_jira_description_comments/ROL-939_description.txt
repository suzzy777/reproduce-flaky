Occassionally the individual weblog cache is not cleared when a new entry is posted. The resulting affect is the entry shows on the new entries panel of the main page, but when one clicks on it, they are directed to the previous entry w/ the current entries permalink. The entry is visable if the entries catagory is clicked.

Since this behavior is intermitent, steps to reproduce are not available.
