I know that you're using this JIRA to test the intermitent failure as it's hard to reproduce on dev box [~abrahamfine], so I'll ignore the review request for now. Please do ping here when the patch is actually ready to be reviewed :)

I've kicked off precommit build for this one again.

The hook is a bit unstable now, so I'll go ahead and commit this one nevertheless.
