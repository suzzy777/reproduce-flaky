I have some thoughts on why this test fails intermitantly. I will publish a patch soon which will have more debug logs and fix for a possible race condition.

[~vihangk1] This is on my list of things we should fix for Impala 3.4.

I am trying to reproduce this locally but I could not. I ran the test in a loop 50 times and I couldn't see any test failure.

https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/15260/ should fix the test failure. 

Patch has been merged into master. Hi [~joemcdonnell] Do I need to manually cherrypick this to 3.4.0 branch?

[~vihangk1] I will do the cherrypick over to 3.4.0.

IMPALA-9357: Fix race condition in alter_database event

The race condition is exposed intermittently, on certain builds which
causes test_event_processing::test_self_events test to fail. This
happens because we are checking for self-event identifiers in the Db
object without taking a lock. When a DDL like 'comment on
database is 'test'' is executed, it is possible that the event
processor thread is triggered as soon as the ALTER_DATABASE event is
generated. This may cause event processor fail the self-event detection
since the self-event identifiers are not yet added to the Db object.

The fix adds a Db lock similar to Table lock. Alter db operations
in CatalogOpExecutor now take db locks instead of metastoreDdlLock_
which makes it consistent with table locking protocol.

Testing:
1. Ran existing tests for events processor.
2. This test was failing on centos6 frequently (failed in 1/3 times).
After the fix I ran the test in a loop for 24 hrs (197 iterations) and
the test didn't fail.
3. Ran core tests with CDP and CDH builds.
