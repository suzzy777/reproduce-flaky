The test axis2/modules/saaj/test/org/apache/axis2/saaj/integration/IntegrationTest.java fails intermittently with a java.net.ConnectException.  This seems to be related to the UtilServer being started and stopped before every test in the setUp() and tearDown() methods.

I have fixed the test in a manner similar to changes made to some of the Integration tests such that the server is started and stopped only one time.  With that change, the test has not failed.

I will submit a patch shortly.
