Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the attached MXML 
2. 
3.
 
 Actual Results:
 
There's a set of 8 RichEditableTexts and a set of 8 Halo Texts in the mxml 
rendering the same HTML 8 times using the spark RichEditableText takes extremely long (I stopped counting after 40 seconds) whereas the Halo Text does it within a second.
 
 Expected Results:
Faster rendering of RichEditableTexts 
 
 Workaround (if any):
Use Halo Text instead

Just to clarify: My app lists incoming HTML emails. The included HTML is one of those emails but sanitised to remove any confidential info.
I've used 8 objects here since my app will loop through several emails and thats when I noticed it.
