Related to intermitted SPUC resizing issue, can reproduce pretty frequently on DroidX and fails often with automation.

Info needed to Lavanya. I can't reproduce the problem on my HTC EVO 3D. Can you add ACTIVATE, ACTIVATING and DEACTIVATE listeners to the stage and trace out each event type. Debug the app on device to be certain that DEACTIVATE events are or aren't firing. If the events aren't firing, then it's likely a StylableStageText or runtime issue. If they are firing, then for some reason SPUC isn't playing the effect.

Debugged this and reproduced on Droid2, in normal scenarios when it works fine I get the sequence for keyboard activate from text input : 
text input in focus, ACTIVATING, ACTIVATE, text input in focus..

and when it gets into the stuck state as in the screenshot, the event sequence is: 
text input in focus, ACTIVATING.. 

and it gets stuck. Keyboard appears but the ACTIVATE event is not dispatched, is apparently a runtime issue..

On another note, it seems much less frequent with the latest build 22823, so this is still an issue but not very obvious (potential intermittency with mustella).

Info needed to Adam. Have you seen this issue where the ACTIVATE event is missing but the soft keyboard still appears?
