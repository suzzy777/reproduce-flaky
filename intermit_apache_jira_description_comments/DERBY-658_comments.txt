Proposal sounds good. I would

 - in 1) use a property specific to the test harness instead of ij.ui.codeset. Overloading multiple meanings on a property could lead to issues, especially for tests that test the operation of  ij.ui.codeset itself. 

- in 6)) the property that generates the output in the fixed encoding sounds like a good direction.


Harness changes are also needed to run tests using different encoding.  Please see http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-683

The patch 'derby-683_tests.diff' solves this problem partially but has following problem found by Myrna http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-683#action_12365038. 


Note that with DERBY-683, now derbyTesting.encoding can be used as a property to run with a different encoding, although there is trouble when running with jvms other than jdk15...(see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1027).

So, in principle, step 1 is done.


While I am getting closer to finish steps 2-5, I have some questions re step 6.

Currently, I think the easiest way to implement it is to read the .out file generated in local encoding (which is how it's always been) back in and write it out in fixed encoding.
I was thinking of adding a property, say, generateUTF8Out, into RunTest, which would create an additional file, <testname>.utf8out. Basically, the harness would do what native2ascii does.

It would mean that a developer would have to run an individual test with the generateUTF8Out property on the command line (not in properties files), then copy the <testname>.utf8out to the location for the <testname>.out in the source tree, instead of the .out, as we'd do currently. All this would only be necessary if you're working in a non-UTF-8 compatible encoding, I think.

Is this an OK approach?

This - DERBY-658_101_20060407_1.* - is the first patch in this effort. This patch is for 10.1. It seemed to me a simple merge would not be possible, so I've duplicated this effort for main (That patch is forthcoming, need to sync up and rerun derbyall one more time).

This patch implements stesp 2-5. Note that step 1 is already implemented on the main codeline, I decided not to copy that code into 10.1 at this time.

With this change, we can no longer use 'run resource' in ij tests. IJ needs to run in the local encoding, the resource in derbyTesting.jar will be in UTF-8 encoding, so they cannot be used. This has impacted mainly on a number of .sql tests in tests/store. I've had to choose between making additional _app.properties files to specify the supportfiles, and modifying the default_app.properties. I chose for the latter, preferring fewer files. However, this then made it impossible for a number of _app.properties files to usedefaults.

Note that this change is a first step - after this, individual tests will need changes to pass on non-ISO-8559 systems...
Also, step 6 will need to get implemented at a later date - I'm even thinking we may not implement it on 10.1...

Note that we need this code in 10.1 to faciltate fixing of bugs on zOS  in 10.1


Forgot to mention - derbyall passed with this patch for 10.1 on linux with jdk14.

Here is the patch for main - DERBY-658_102_20060307_1.*.

Again, most files changed are because not being able to use the 'run resource' with .sql files on non-ISO5889 systems. 

The details of this change:
- now a file .tmpmstr is *always* created for comparison with the .out file - before this change, the .tmpmstr was only created with networkserver.
- all .properties, .sql, .exclude, etc files are read/accessed using fixed encoding, thus assuming they come from a .jar built on an ISO-5889 system.
- all  .sql, .txt and .view files listed in supportfiles= in _app.properties files, and the .policy file are copied to the machine in local encoding. Other files are copied in fixed encoding. 
- changes were needed in .sql tests that used 'run resource', and thus also in _app.properties files for thos tests. Most of the changes were in the tests/store directory.

I ran derbyall on linux with jdk14 with this patch, and had the following failures also seen elsewhere:
- lang/wisconsin.java
- lang/checkDataSource30.java times out (hang?)
Also saw test derbynet/runtimeinfo.java fail again, which it has been doing intermittingly with builds from this particular setup. I've seen one other person mention this, although it doesn't show on any nightly failures...Also passes on another system of mine...
Also saw the following failures after I sync-ed up, rebuilt, and reran derbyall (without making further changes, so I rather think it wasn't related):
- derbynet/sysinfo.java and derbynet/sysinfo_withproperties.java (with db2jcc in my classpath):

Note that these _1 patches do not include step 6 listed in the bug description (providing a property that causes a .out file to be created in utf8 encoding).

Hi Myrna, this is a huge patch, and I noticed that the bulk of your change was to accommodate the change from run resource to run. Instead of switching to just use run, what if ij enforced UTF-8 encoding on files loaded by run resource? I think its an acceptable change, since run resource is not documented and is just used to facilitate testing. I've attached a patch that does that.

I think the approach to modify the run resource functionality is better than the way I approached it, because it reduces the number of files to get changed...
So I'm attaching a new version of the 10.2 patch - DERBY-658_102_20060413.* - which includes the ij change, does not have all the run resource and .sql and _app.properties file changes. It does, however, include the implermentation for the utf8out file - this is only useable with an individual test, as discussed before.

With this patch, on linux - jdk14 - derbyall passed with the familiar in my environment failures for runtimeinfo, wisconsin, and sysinfo (re db2jcc security permissions). On zOS / os390 there are some problems that will need to be addressed separately.

Still to be done:
- matching patch for 10.1 (derbyall on linux is running).
- update to testing/README.html.


Herewith attaching an updated 10.1 patch - DERBY-658_101_20060413.stat & diff  which includes the  same 10.1  ../functionTests/harness changes, and the ij changes. derbyall showed no unexpected failures (JapanCodeConversion because I have no native2ascii; and 2 intermittently failing tests: dataSourcePermissions_net, stress multi).

Note, that the 10.1 changes do not have the derbyTesting.encoding properties (that came with DERBY-683), nor does it have the property to generate utf8out. 

Committed 10.2 patch revision 394770 and 10.1 patch with revision 394771.

Attaching the follow-up patch for 10.2 - DERBY-658_102_20060418.* . This patch adds comments in README.htm, adds .multi and .properties in CopySuppFiles to list of supportfiles that will get copied into local encoding and modified drda/testProto to access *.inc and protocol.tests files with UTF-8 encoding.

With this patch, derbyall on linux passes (except for known diffs in sysinfo* (db2jcc in same path as sane derby.jars), runtimeinfo (my build only) and wisconsin) and now on zOS, ibm14 and ibm15, stress.multi and derbynet/testProtocol.java pass.
 
I think this patch is ready for commit.

Attaching the 10.1 version of the follow up patch - DERBY-658_101_20060418.*. This has the same changes for testProto.java and CopySuppFiles.java as the 10.2 patch, but the README has fewer changes, mostly because the 10.1 README has had fewer overal changes than the 10.2.

Once these two patches are committed this bug can be closed.

Committed 20060418 patches to trunk with revision 395486 and 10.1 with revision 395488.
