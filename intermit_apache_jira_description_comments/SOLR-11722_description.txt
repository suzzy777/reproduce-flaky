This issue is about creating a single API command to create a "Time Routed Alias" along with its first collection.  Need to decide what endpoint URL it is and parameters.

Perhaps in v2 it'd be {{/api/collections?command=create-routed-alias}} or alternatively piggy-back off of command=create-alias but we add more options, perhaps with a prefix like "router"?
Inputs:
* alias name
* misc collection creation metadata (e.g. config, numShards, ...) perhaps in this context with a prefix like "collection."
* metadata for TimeRoutedAliasUpdateProcessor, currently: router.field
* date specifier for first collection; can include "date math".

We'll certainly add more options as future features unfold.

I believe the collection needs to be created first (referring to the alias name via a core property), and then the alias pointing to it which demands collections exist first.  When figuring the collection name, you'll need to reference the format in TimeRoutedAliasUpdateProcessor.
