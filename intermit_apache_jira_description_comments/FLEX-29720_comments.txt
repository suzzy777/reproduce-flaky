we have installed hotifix 3 + and it gives us the same message that Open method is not defined for FlexTree Class superclass FlexList. This case is only when I perform the open operation on a tree by opening QTP Tool using Script. To be able to work on the tree I have to first open the Tool manually. 

My Scenario is to open QTP using script and then open a Test in QTP and run it against the Tree but this doesn't work. 
The Scenario which works is I have to Open QTP manually and then Open the Test in QTP and run... this case works. 

Is there any dependency lying here..??? 

would really appreciate ur comments on this as this is blocking me from invoking QTP using Script.

there is no dependency between tree automation (like open method) and opening and running tests through scripts. This is intermittent issue a smililar issue was seen and with modification to TEAFlex it was fixed. Ideally you should now move to Flex moxie as quite a few bug fixes have gone in.

IF you are seeing FlexListBase entry for FlexTree in TEAFlex.xml still, then it is case that you have not got hotfix 3 plugin installed correctly. Can you try the workaround i suggested in original bug? 

Also you can take advantage of charts/ADG automation if you plan to move to moxie.
