HADOOP-12970 Intermitent SignatureDoesNotMatch Exception is fixed by HADOOP-11687. 

And from hadoop-aws >= 2.8, HADOOP-11687 is applied. but Spark 2.3.1 is still using hadoop-aws 2.7.7. 

I was stumpled upon Intermitent SignatureDoesNotMatch Exception with s3 with spark 2.3.1. So I guess backporting might benefit some spark users. In my situation, SignatureDoesNotMatch was reliably reproducible (4 out of 8 attemp). And after using patched version symptom was not seen (0 out of 10)
