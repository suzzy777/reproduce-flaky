Simon, pretty positive i have seen the first one in hudson for trunk too... but i didnt know if Mike had tackled it already.

The second one i don't think i have seen, perhaps there is a corner-case bug in the test where it doesn't close an IndexReader?

There's a similar failure on trunk, still, but in the testAddDocumentOnDiskFull test.

If it still happens after I commit LUCENE-2680 I'll track it down.... I suspect we are missing a checkpoint call on exception somewhere.

{code}
_4_0.prx=1, _4.pst=1,
{code}

seems like simple text ignores the codec ID - I will go an fix that at least

bq. If it still happens after I commit LUCENE-2680 I'll track it down.... I suspect we are missing a checkpoint call on exception somewhere.
Mike, since 2680 is committed I will merge and check it I still see those issues.

It's still happening on trunk!  I will track it down and corner it!

Got another one but that one is outside of the IndexWriter* tests....

no reproduce line unfortunately since it happened during setup :( - so just for the record

this has never happened again since I merged with trunk after LUCENE-2680 - moving out!
