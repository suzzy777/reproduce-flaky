The test case does not use Flex.  flash.display.Loader is part of the Adobe FlashPlayer, not the Apache Flex project.

FWIW, I have not looked at the entire source code, but if the children are actually movieclips with multiple frames, maybe the children you are looking for are not available until a later frame.


Hi Alex,

I'm afraid that's not the issue. They're all single frame movieclips and it's been reproduced by someone else on Stack Overflow without sharing my FLA. The weirdest thing is it only seems to happen over a network. I'm pretty sure this is a genuine bug. Where is the correct place to post it?

Cheers,
Tim

 		 	   		  


Adobe Flash Player bugs should be reported at bugbase.adobe.com.

One other thing to note.  In the StackOverflow code listings, it appears that there is no code preventing the loaders from getting garbage collected.  I would fix that and see if you get stability that way.
