Changelist 188212

Details: The initialization on ie, which requires an iframe was delayed (that is, the objects were registered to the HistoryManager *before* the initialization had a chance to run.  Changed the current instantiattion code to run on "dom" loaded, instead of window.onload.

I can get this to work on Firefox 2.0.0.9 (WIN), but I cant get this to work in IE6 or IE7 on XP.
Added new source file (SDK-12787.zip) which has all my generated files. Even if i manually copy the latest history.js files from P4, it still isnt working as expected on IE

Update: I was using Version 3.0 build 188306

There was a timeout error reproducing intermitently only on some computers. Retested the fix on other three WinXP computer. The latest files are in bug_12787_2.zip

What I did to test it:

1. Unzip the files somewhere on a webserver. 
2. Navigate to the "index"page (for example, http://localhost/bug_12787_2/)
3. Click on main.html
4. Click on Dreamweaver - the url updates to something like #app=36b9&57e2-selectedIndex=1
5. Click on Contribute - the url updates to #app=36b9&57e2-selectedIndex=4
6. Click the back button - dreamweaver is selected. 
7. Click the back button - Contribute is selected
8. Click the back button - nothing is selected
9. Click the back button - navigate back to the index page
10. Click the forward button - nothing is selected
11. Click the forward button - Dreamweaver is selected
12. Click the forward button - Contribute is selected, the forward stack finishes.

Changelist 188374

Notes: more checks for different timeout errors added for IE versions. 

If you are using Flex Builder to create a project and check, please make sure that the project has the latest version of history.js (FB caches the templates inside the workspace, and you might get the old files when you create a project, even if the sdk build has changed). 

I tested the fix on three different machines + 1 VMware instance, using the steps above.

Upgraded to today's Flex Builder and SDK Version 3.0 build 188338.

I'm still seeing issues w/ IE6 and IE7 on WinXP.
Mainly, if i try loading a URL with a trailing "#", i get some bad results. On my IE6, i get an error dialog saying the page cant be loaded, and then i see a default "The page cannot be displayed" error page in IE (so the Flex app never loads). I think this is somewhat serious since it seems that DeepLinking automatically adds the trailing "#" if you load the HTML file directly. For example, "http://10.132.64.106:8300/Bugs/SDK-12787b/main.html" refreshes to "http://10.132.64.106:8300/Bugs/SDK-12787b/main.html#". If a user were to copy that URL and send it to somebody else, the second person may never see the Flex app (assuming they are using IE, which is statistically quite possible)). I believe this is the result of this bug, http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-11428

I'm also seeing a hard-to-repro issue where i get a "`null` is null or not an object" error (see attached screenshot) but it only seems to happen in my IE6 on the first load and i cant get the error again unless i reboot.
