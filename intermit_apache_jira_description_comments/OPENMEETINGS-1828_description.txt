This seems to be an intermittent problem, as there are times when you start the service it works, and there is times it does not.  Toggling the  "sound notification" does not seem to change anything.  There are times server starts and you will receive new chat message notifications, other times (most recent today) you will receive a notification when a users joins the room but no notifications when a chat message is received , and at other times it is complete silence.  I have tried various browser combinations Edge, IE, Chrome, and Firefox and that does not seem to make the difference.  And can not find any reasoning on why this works at times and others not.

Was looking for an error in the debug logging but did not find anything that shows an error.
