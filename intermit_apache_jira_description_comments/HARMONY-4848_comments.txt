Note the intermitent failures are possible, so these EFLs may be additionally corrected later if "regression" is detected in post-M3 code and it will be intermittently reproducible on M3 code.

Please also note that EUT3.2/winx86 pass rate was increased since M2 which means related EFL contains the tests which are actually passed.

I have the warning (currently commented) in EUT Summary Reporter notifying about such records in EFL. I'm going to uncomment this warning and update EFL accordingly.

I've added modified EFL list for both EUT3.2 and EUT3.3.

Pleas note that ... more changes on EFL may be done since there may be intermittent failures.

I recommend establishing a daily run of EUT (3.2/3.3 x winx86/linx86) on same snapshot - M3 - to be able to define the list of tests which are fixedly passed each run.

So, please do not close this JIRA until we get a GREEN status for EUT on M3 snapshot.

Thanks

There is no "unexpected" issues remained for EUT on x86 platform (although there is still a "configuration" crash for jdtcorecompiler suite which is not reproduced locally).

So there is nothing to do for x86 EFL now. Set this bug to FIXED then.
