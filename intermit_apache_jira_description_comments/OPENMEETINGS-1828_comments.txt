Just have checked, everything seems to work for me
The following logic is currently implemented

no sound is being played if:
* browser doesn't support it (or playing mp3 is denied by some browser restrictions)
* user turn off the sound
* chat is opened and user can see messages are arriving

if all above is FALSE you will hear the sound

We can discuss the changes to above behavior in user@ mailing list
