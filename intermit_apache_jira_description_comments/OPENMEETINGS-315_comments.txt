Do you have stable steps to reproduce the issue?
What revision of OpenMeetings 2.0 are you exactly testing?

Sorry for missing information. My test version is r1346647-05-06-2012_2314. 

To restart test, i deleted the room id 9 and 10  (see img OM-01.jpg). So i closed the OM and entered again. The system created the rooms again,  id 11 and 12 with the same name (conference and seminar).

To reproduce the issue:

I entered at "My conference room" (img OM-03). At the first time, i loaded one presentation and i had an time out error but the presentation was loaded (see img 04). I created more two whiteboards. In the first i put one presentation, at second leave blank and third i put a movie clip. I did some test and exit aplicatiion. When i entered again, the video test window did not appear, button exit does not work and i cannot close whiteboards.


I think it is a intermitent issue. Sometimes occurs sometimes not. Sometimes i enter at this room and video window appear without confirmation and the bug disppear.

To solve the issue we need a reproducable use case. A problem that only occasionally happens cannot be fixed.

One doubt, the demo (http://demo.openmeetings.de/) is always the last version? If not, could we have every day one place that we can test the last version?. In this case it will be more ease to other people help to find issues.

Thanks

I believe this need to be closed, due to missing steps
