Tried to stabilize tests by using conditions and allowing for larger timeouts in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1503771 .

Keeping task open for verification on builds.apache.org.

I think you changed test logic:

-            assertEquals(0, jobManager.getStatistics().getNumberOfQueuedJobs());
-            assertEquals(1, count.get());
-            assertEquals(0, jobManager.findJobs(JobManager.QueryType.ALL, TOPIC, -1, (Map<String, Object>[])null).size());
+            new RetryLoop(new RetryLoop.Condition() {
+
+                @Override
+                public String getDescription() {
+                    return "Waiting for job to be processed";
+                }
+
+                @Override
+                public boolean isTrue() throws Exception {
+                    return jobManager.getStatistics().getNumberOfQueuedJobs() == 0
+                            && processedJobsCount.get() == 0
+                            && jobManager.findJobs(JobManager.QueryType.ALL, TOPIC, -1, (Map<String, Object>[]) null)
+                                    .size() == 0;
+                }
+            }, CONDITION_TIMEOUT

before it checked for 0,1,0 - now for 0,0,0 for the three conditions

You're right, going to fix it shortly.

Committed http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1503779

- fixed test logic which was changed inadvertently
- included the org.apache.sling.testing.tools bundle in the pax-exam setup

Fixed (again) the pax-exam setup in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1503793

Considering fixed, did not fail since moving to individual jobs
