Ok, for M2 there was 1 Expected Failure List (EFL) for EUT3.2/winx86 configuration (that time efl for linux for copied/pasted from windows one).

Based on CC-reports for EUT there are different set of failures / errors for EUT3.2/EUT3.3 winx86/linx86. 

So it is a time to create the eut/platform specific EFLs keeping the "common failure" in shared EFL.

Having these EFLs in place we can obtain the GREEN status in EUT CC-reports and TRACK/FIX THE REGRESSIONS in post-M3 code.

Thanks
