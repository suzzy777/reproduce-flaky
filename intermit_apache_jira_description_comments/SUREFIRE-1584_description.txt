The very useful feature for integration tests ¨[Rerun Failing Tests|https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/rerun-failing-tests.html]¨ is currently only supported for the very outdated JUnit 4.

The documentation says: ¨This feature is supported only for JUnit 4.x.¨

Can you please support this feature for JUnit 5.3 or later?
