I think I'm seeing another instance of this here: https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1078/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.db.commitlog/BatchCommitLogTest/testOutOfOrderLogDiscard_3_/

One more: https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1089/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.db.commitlog/BatchCommitLogTest/testOutOfOrderFlushRecoveryWithCompaction_3__compression/

Closing tentatively as dup of CASSANDRA-17232. They point to different stacks but I have an educated suspicion it's the same underlying cause. We can reopen if this turns out wrong.
