Deployment or a BPEL 1.1 process can fail with the following error.  This failure is intermittent.  Processes that previously deployed and ran successfully will no longer deploy.   Once this occurs it seems failry consistent.  I tried re-installing Tomcat and Ode from scratch and the problme continued to occur.

I debugged and found that that there is some cleanup at the end of compilation that assumes an XSL transform factory has been initialized.  As far as I can tell it never does get set up at least for BPEL 1.1.  Not sure how this ever worked and why it shows up intermitently.  Anyway I have a fix for it - just check for null - and my proceses now deploy again.  

The problem was originally described in this email to the dev mailing list
