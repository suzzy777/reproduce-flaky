Varrious  OSGi tests/samples intermitently fail when running on the Hudson build machine with:
 
!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 4 0 2010-01-15 09:28:43.689
!MESSAGE Error reading configuration: /tmp/hudson/.tuscany/equinox/f90e7d4b-f3c9-4df5-9f5e-d9c4a955a32b/config/org.eclipse.osgi/.manager/.fileTableLock (No such file or directory)

See ML thread: http://apache.markmail.org/message/lu3ov5sbpyryjmuj

This is happening so often now its getting hard to get a clean build through.
