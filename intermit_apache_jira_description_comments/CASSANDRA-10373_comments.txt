The issue for this one was that, for compact storage tables with no clustering columns, we store the value for the row in a column called value, which the names filter sent over by the 2.1 node doesn't anticipate. This causes an error when creating the read response because there's an unexpected column in the results. I'm explicitly adding the value column to the selection when a names filter is being created for these tables in the legacy range slice serializer.

LGTM.

Thank you.
