I have seen the same intermitent failure. Screen-grab attached.

I believe this happens when you re-run the tests without restarting the broker ude to the queue not being deleted. I'll confirm and fix this.


Gordon, that is correct, just figured that out. happens on re-run without shutdown.

Resolved by making the test queue exclusive for each of those tests such that they are destroyed on closing the connection. Subsequent re-runs don't see the messages left on the queues and don't fail.
