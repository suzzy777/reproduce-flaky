this was known issue and got fixed as well during SDK 2.0.1 hotfix 2. Which version you are using? Can you confirm that FlexTree is having following definition in TEAFlex.xml file available under plugin installation directory?

<ClassInfo Name="FlexTree" GenericTypeID="tree" Extends="FlexListBase" SupportsTabularData="true">

Hi Ajit,
                 Sorry for the delayed response, We dont have the hotfix2 with SDK.  We will try installing which may take few days as it has to go thru the approval process... 
Yes FlexTree has that entry in TEAFlex.xml file.   Please let me know if there are any other suggestions ...
Thanks for ur prompt reply.

I would suggest to upgrade to hotfix 2 as quite a few fixes went into it including few new features like ndex based recording more support for descriptive programming etc.

For now you can change the line in TEAFlex.xml file found at your plugin installation directory. Change line from 


  <ClassInfo Name="FlexTree" GenericTypeID="tree" Extends="FlexListBase" SupportsTabularData="true">

to have


  <ClassInfo Name="FlexTree" GenericTypeID="tree" Extends="FlexList" SupportsTabularData="true">

This is kind of work around and it is suggested to upgrade to hotfix 2.

Hi Ajit, As per your advise we have installed hotifix 3 + and it gives us the same message that Open method is not defined for FlexTree Class superclass FlexList.   This case is only when I perform the open operation on a tree by opening QTP Tool using Script.  To be able to work on the tree I have to first open the Tool manually.

My Scenario is to open QTP using script and then open a Test in QTP and run it against the Tree but this doesn't work.
The Scenario which works is I have to Open QTP manually and then Open the Test in QTP and run... this case works.  

Is there any dependency lying here..???

would really appreciate ur comments on this as this is blocking me from invoking QTP using Script.
