Have a look at this stack overflow for a complete explaination and instruction on how to reproduce: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14464898/flash-display-loader-intermitently-causing-children-of-loaded-swf-to-loose-type

When two movieclips are loaded into an application using a flash.display.Loader and Event.COMPLETE is dispatched from both loaders on different frames, some instances in the first movieclip to be loaded loose their type when the second movieclip becomes available. For example, a recursive search for all decendents of type MC_Circle fails when normally it works. I have been recomended to report this issue by users of Stack Overflow who were able to reproduce it. I'm not sure of the full list of affected SDKs or Flash Player versions but I have been using 4.6. I have only tried hosting the swfs to be loaded on linux machine though the problem is reproducing with the loader swf on various OS. It's possible the problem only occurs when loading over a network.
