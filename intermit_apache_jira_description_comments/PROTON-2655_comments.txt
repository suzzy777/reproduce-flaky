PROTON-2655 Ensure that reconnect failed timeout can be met

The timeout is shorter that the total possible time it can take
to schedule the full set of reconnect attempts if the CI box is
overloaded.  The timeout should extend beyond the possible time
that the reconnection attempts can take.

PROTON-2655 Extends test timeout and reduce duration of backoff

Allow for longer time before test times out and reduce the backoff
range on the reconnection attempts to avoid over long test runs.
