After successfully bringing a file from iCloud into apps file system using jcesarmobile/FilePicker-Phonegap-iOS-Plugin, the cordova-plugin-file-transfer throws an intermitent error 'FILE_NOT_FOUND' code: 1.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

The path of the file being picked is :

/private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/62995A87-99B3-423D-BA11-D5FB0DA44864/tmp/com.dearle-Inbox/4156341_How_to_get_started.pdf.

The pick using filepicker is always successful, resolving the path using cordova-plugin-file 'cordova.file.tempDirectory + fileName' to verify the file exists is always successful.

It is only when I try to use the resolved path in cordova-plugin-file-transfer that I run into problems.  It is not a constant problem as I was able to upload some successfully sometimes.  

The problem only occurred when using the path provided by filepicker.  

The workaround was to move the file using cordova-plugin-file, resolve and provide a path to cordova-plugin-file-transfer to the new file address.
