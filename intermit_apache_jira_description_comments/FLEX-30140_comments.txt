There is difference in drop behavior of Halo and Spark List controls. So we were recording item above the drop index in Spark List.
But that doesn't work in AIR. So instead we record the item below the drop index for both Halo and spark but while replaying, we drop the item above the exact midpoint of the recorded item

Issue still present in sdk build 4.0.0.12112 and dmv build 261514 when drag and drop of element American Express 4 records in the script as DragStart "American Express5"    i.e the next element in the list

Window("FlexNativeMenuProject").SparkAirApplication("FlexNativeMenuProject").SparkAirList("_FlexNativeMenuProject_List1").DragStart "American Express5"    
Window("FlexNativeMenuProject").SparkAirApplication("FlexNativeMenuProject").SparkAirList("_FlexNativeMenuProject_List2").DragDrop "copy","American Ex3"

This is now an intermitent issue.

We were recording the item on dragStart. We should record it on mouseDown.
