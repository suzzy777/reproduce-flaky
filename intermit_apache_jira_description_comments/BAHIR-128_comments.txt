    this change should not be necessary. the `.idea/` folder should only get created at the project root level. any nested files and folders are already covered. maybe a mishap when setting up IntelliJ?

    @emlaver -- is this an outdated copyright statement? If it is still valid you may need to check with the author and/or IBM if you can contribute this code (or variations of it) to open-source.
    
    I am surprised the RAT check did not catch this.

    Very odd that the RAT license checks succeeded. Apparently it is our `scalastyle` checks which complain about any non-conformant license headers, but those don't cover `*.java` files, so I need to update our `checkstyle` rules for Java sources. But I am still puzzled about RAT letting this pass (@lresende)

    @ckadner It's valid and the author is OK with this existing in the open-source.  From my understanding, we're (Cloudant) allowed to retain the copyright on code we open source, but the license effectively grants free use.

    @emlaver -- I may have influenced the test execution by running the `mvn test slq-cloudant -q` locally while the Jenkins PR builder was running the same tests (I was using the same Cloudant account as Jenkins). I just restarted the build.

    After more than 10 successful builds I'd say that the flaky `sql-cloudant` tests are more stable now than they have ever been. Good work @emlaver. Once you have confirmed that there is no conflict with the copyright for the new code I am happy to merge this.


Github user emlaver commented on the issue:

    @ckadner I've confirmed and there is no conflict.  Let's hold off on merging.  I still have some work I'll commit to this for improved stability and part of another work item.  I'll also need to run my usual larger stability load tests (>10GB).  And, Rich Ellis on my team will also be reviewing this work.


Github user ckadner commented on the issue:

    @emlaver since you are still working on this code, do you think you could take care of those deprecation warnings this time around?  :-)


Github user emlaver commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/bahir/pull/57
  
    @ckadner  I've got those changes on another branch that still needs a bit more testing.  I'll open a PR with the separate ticket once it's ready.

    WDYT about making the `seq_interval` the `bulkSize` instead of hard-coding?

    I'm amazed this parameter was hard-coded as it seems to be a fairly critical tuning parameter for streaming. I guess this is one for another PR.

    I'm a bit confused about this change. Since Spark Streaming is the basis for "real-time" or "continuous applications" doesn't this need to keep listening to the changes feed to wait for more changes?

    Yes, this was not visible as part of the initial internal `_changes` work.  I will create a new JIRA item and PR for this.

    For our internal implementation, we (myself and Mayya) wanted the user to have a snapshot of data to load into Spark.  For that to be possible, we decided to use `continuous` style feed with a doc limit.  With the new _changes implementation from Mike's project, the `normal` feed is stable and works as expected.  I've also lowered the amount of requests/load time by removing the HTTP request for the doc limit since it's not needed with `normal` style _changes feed.
    To work with data in "real-time", you can use `CloudantReciever` which creates an eternal changes feed within the Spark Streaming context.

    Yes, I think that's a good idea.  Fixed in f758996.

Commit 0e1505a8960bfe40ea025267bbf36ec5c4cf5c79 in bahir's branch refs/heads/master from [~emlaver]
[ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=bahir.git;h=0e1505a ]

[BAHIR-128] Improve sql-cloudant _changes receiver

This change improves the stability of _changes receiver and
fix the intermitent failing test in sql-cloudant's
CloudantChangesDFSuite.

How

Improve performance and decrease testing time by setting batch size
to 8 seconds and using seq_interval _changes feed option.
Use getResource to load json files path
Added Mike Rhodes's ChangesRowScanner for reading each _changes line
and transforming to GSON's JSON object
Added Mike Rhodes's ChangesRow representing a row in the changes feed

Closes #57
