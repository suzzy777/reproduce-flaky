A quick fix to the problem is to check for null at the point where the xsl factory is cleaned up.  This does not address why the problem appears to be intermittent but it should be safe.  I think the clean up is for the ODE specifc BPEL 2.0 feature to support XSL transforms.

The fix is in utils\src\main\java\org\apache\ode\utils\xsl\XslTransformHandler.java.  The null pointer fault occurs in this method because _transformerFactory is not initialized.

  public void setErrorListener(ErrorListener l) {
    _transformerFactory.setErrorListener(l);
  }

I fixed this as follows:

  public void setErrorListener(ErrorListener l) {
      if(__log.isDebugEnabled()){
    	  __log.debug("Xsl Transformer Factory = " + _transformerFactory);
      }
	  if(_transformerFactory != null){
	      _transformerFactory.setErrorListener(l);
	  }
  }
