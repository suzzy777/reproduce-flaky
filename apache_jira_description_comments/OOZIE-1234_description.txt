The event listeners will emit notifications for workflow, coordinator and SLA events. There are different ways of sending notifications like through JMS or email.
This JIRA will focus on JMS Event listeners for workflow and coordinator related events.

JMS implementation of event listener will send messages on a particular topic
In addition to the JMS payload, the notification message will have properties on which the consumers can apply selectors to filter messages at JMS server.
The JMS event message will be serialized and Oozie will also provide a helper class for consumers to deserialize these messages back to Java Objects.

Classes

EventMessage: There can be different event messages like WorkflowJobSuccessMessage, WorkflowJobFailureMessage similar to different events in OOZIE-1209

EventListener: Listener to publish event messages on msg bus. One implementation will be JMSWorkflowEventlistener for publishing workflow related event messages

MessageFactory: Factory for providing serializer, deserializer and creating Oozie event messages instances

MessageSerializer: Serialize the JMS messages. One implementation can be JSONMessageSerializer to send the messages as JSON string.

MessageDeserializer: Class to convert the serialized string back to Java Event Messages.
