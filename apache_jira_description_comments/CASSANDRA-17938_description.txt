As recently [discussed on the mail list|https://lists.apache.org/thread/o166v7nr9lxnzdy5511tv40rr9t6zbrw], it would be useful if we were able to run multiple test classes on the test multiplexer with a single push:
{quote}The multiplexer only allows to run a single test class per push. This is ok
for fixing existing flakies (its original purpose), and for most minor
changes, but it can be quite inconvenient for testing large patches that
add or modify many tests. For example, the patch for CEP-19 directly
modifies 31 test classes, which means 31 CircleCI config pushes. This
number can be somewhat reduced with some wildcards on the class names, but
the process is still quite inconvenient. I guess that other large patches
will find the same problem.

The purpose of this ticket is replacing the {{REPEATED_UTEST_CLASS}} environment var by a new {{REPEATED_UTEST_CLASSES}} var that accepts a list of classes, or an equivalent solution.

The same should be done for the analogous {{REPEATED_JVM_UPGRADE_DTEST_CLASS}} and possibly {{{}REPEATED_DTEST_NAME{}}}.
