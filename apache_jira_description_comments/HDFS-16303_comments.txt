Thank you for your contribution, [~KevinWikant]. Would you provide PR for branch-3.3 and branch-3.2? The commit cannot be cherry-picked cleanly.

Re-opening the Jira to track work for cherry picking the change

Hi [~KevinWikant], how is this issue going?

My apologies for the delay, something high priority came up at work.
 * backport to Hadoop 2.x : https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/3920
 * backport to Hadoop 3.x : https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/3921

I have also made 1 small change to the DatanodeAdminDefaultMonitor based on a rare edge case I identified: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/3923

Merged https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/3921 into branch-3.3.

Merged [https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/3920] into branch-3.2. Thank you [~KevinWikant] for your contribution for backporting.
