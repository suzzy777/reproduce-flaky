Currently there is no way to determine what kind of hints a node has, apart from looking at the filenames (thus host-ids) on disk. Having a way to access this information would help with debugging hint creation/replay scenarios.
In addition to the JMX method, there is a new nodetool command:


{noformat}$ bin/nodetool -h 127.0.0.1 -p 7100 listendpointspendinghints
