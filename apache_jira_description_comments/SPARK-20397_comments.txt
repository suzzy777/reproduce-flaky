I'm fine if we want to increase the time out - but I suspect if Jenkins is running slow this might take an indeterminate time and simply increase from 5 sec to 10 sec or 30 sec might not be enough

User 'zsxwing' has created a pull request for this issue:

I saw the other tests use 5 sec and so just to make it consistent.
