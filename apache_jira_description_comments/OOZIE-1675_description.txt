On hadoop-1, when oozie adds a file path which is an absoute URI on local cluster (i.e. of form hdfs://NN1-host:port/file-path) to distributed cache, it is not working.

The issue is that tasks spawned by oozie jobs are not getting these paths added to their classpath and hence failing. In hadoop-1, DistributedCache.addFileToClasspath() appends paths in classpath with path.separator (which is ':' on linux). That won't work if ':' character is present in the path itself, which is true in case of an absolute URI. Till oozie 3.3, absolute paths on local cluster were working because of earlier logic.
