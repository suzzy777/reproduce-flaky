As part of MESOS-6285, we observed an agent stuck in the recovery phase.  The agent would do the following in a loop:
# Systemd starts the agent.
# The agent detects the master, but does not connect yet.  The agent needs to recover first.
# The agent responds to {{PingSlaveMessage}} from the master, but it is stalled in recovery.
# The agent is OOM-killed by the kernel before recovery finishes.  Repeat (1-4).

The consequences of this:
* Frameworks will never get a TASK_LOST or terminal status update for tasks on this agent.
* Executors on the agent can connect to the agent, but will not be able to register.

We should consider adding some timeout/intervention in the master for responsive, but non-recoverable agents.
