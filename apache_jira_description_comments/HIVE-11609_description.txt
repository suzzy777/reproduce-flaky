It seems like the capability to add filter to an hbase scan which was added as part of HIVE-6411 doesn't work. This is primarily because in the HiveHBaseInputFormat, the filter is added in the getsplits instead of getrecordreader. This works fine for start and stop keys but not for filter because a filter is respected only when an actual scan is performed. This is also related to the initial refactoring that was done as part of HIVE-3420.
