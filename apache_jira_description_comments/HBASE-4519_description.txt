There's a hardcoded 25 seconds sleep in HBaseTestingUtility.expireSession: 

{code}
int sessionTimeout = 5 * 1000; // 5 seconds
...
final long sleep = sessionTimeout * 5L;
LOG.info("ZK Closed Session 0x" + Long.toHexString(sessionID) +
  "; sleeping=" + sleep);
Thread.sleep(sleep);
{code}

I'm pretty sure this can be lowered at lot, and it would speed up a couple of tests. The only thing I'm afraid of is if this was made to accomodate flaky tests.
