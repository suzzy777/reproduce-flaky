MiniHBaseCluster can try to start multiple region servers.  But all of them except one will die in putting up the web UI
because of BindException since HConstants.REGIONSERVER_INFO_PORT_AUTO is set to false by default.

This issue will make many unit tests depending on multiple region servers flaky, such as TestAdmin.
