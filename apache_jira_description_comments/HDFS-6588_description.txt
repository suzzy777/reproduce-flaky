When addressing Daryn Sharp's comment for HDFS-6475 quoted below:

What I'm saying is I think the patch adds too much unnecessary code. Filing an improvement to delete all but a few lines of the code changed in this patch seems a bit odd. I think you just need to:
- Delete getTrueCause entirely instead of moving it elsewhere
- In saslProcess, just throw the exception instead of running it through getTrueCause since it's not a "InvalidToken wrapping another exception" anymore.
- Keep your 3-line change to unwrap SecurityException in toResponse

There are multiple test failures, after making the suggested changes, Filing this jira to dedicate to the investigation of removing getTrueCause method.

More detail will be put in the first comment.
