The scanner of latest memstore may be lost if we make quick flushes. The following step may help explain this issue.
# put data_A (seq id = 10, active store data_A and snapshots is empty)
# snapshot of 1st flush (active is empty and snapshot stores data_A)
# put data_B (seq id = 11, active store data_B and snapshot store data_A)
# create user scanner (read point = 11, so It should see the data_B)
# commit of 1st flush
#* clear snapshot ((hfile_A has data_A, active store data_B, and snapshot is empty)
#* update the reader (the user scanner receives the hfile_A)
# snapshot of 2st flush (active is empty and snapshot store data_B)
# commit of 2st flush
#* clear snapshot (hfile_A has data_A, hfile_B has data_B, active is empty, and snapshot is empty) – this is critical piece.
#* -update the reader- (haven't happen)
# user scanner update the kv scanners (it creates scanner of hfile_A but nothing of memstore)
# user see the older data A – wrong result
