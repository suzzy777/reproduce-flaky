All minor comments:
 * Deprecated {{CFS#loadNewSSTables()}} no longer needs to be synchronized. It just constructs an {{ImportOptions}} instance and passes it to the synchronized {{loadNewSSTables(ImportOptions).}}
 * Add a reference (e.g. @see) to {{CFSMBean.importNewSSTables}} from {{SSMBean.loadNewSSTables}}
 * In Verifier, is it more appropriate to favor {{OutputHandler#output}} over {{OutputHandler#debug}} for the error message when a key is out of range?
 * Would like to see some tests (including base/empty case, edge cases like wrap around) for {{RangeOwnHelper}}
 * {{nodetool refresh}}: Is the removal of the deprecation output intentional?

bq. In Verifier, is it more appropriate to favor OutputHandler#output over OutputHandler#debug for the error message when a key is out of range?
yeah, made it {{OutputHandler#warn}} 
bq. Would like to see some tests (including base/empty case, edge cases like wrap around) for {{RangeOwnHelper}}
added, also made it clearer that ROH can't continue to be used after finding an out-of-range token by making it throw exceptions instead of returning true/false

Also refactored {{Verifier}} to use a {{KeyIterator}} instead of manually deserializing the index when checking keys.

* The output when {{extended=false}}, {{checkOwnsTokens=true}} is still debug (because the message was removed and the exception is logged as debug). I see it changed when extended=true. Verifier#L217.
 * While cleaning things up, should {{ColumnFamilyStore#findBestDiskAndInvalidateCaches}} be refactored to use {{KeyIterator}} as well?
 * EDIT: Also, just noticed the failing dtest. Seems to be in an area related-ish to these changes but I am not familiar enough with it yet to know if its related or just a flaky test. (EDIT: it failed here on a branch without this change https://circleci.com/gh/jrwest/cassandra/86#tests/containers/66)

yep! nice catch
bq. : Also, just noticed the failing dtest. 
yeah I should have a look, but I think it is unrelated to this

Looks like the most recent changes moved the second {{if (shouldCountKeys)}} into the upper while loop, which I don't think was intended.

yeah, unintended, fixed in a new commit

+1

And committed, thanks!
