Connection failure may not be detected within IgniteConfiguration.failureDetectionTimeout. Actual worst delay is: ServerImpl.CON_CHECK_INTERVAL + IgniteConfiguration.failureDetectionTimeout. Node ping routine is duplicated.

We should fix:

1. Failure detection timeout should take in account last sent message. Current ping is bound to own time:
{code:java}ServerImpl. RingMessageWorker.lastTimeConnCheckMsgSent{code}
This is weird because any discovery message check connection. 

2. Make connection check interval depend on failure detection timeout (FTD). Current value is a constant:
{code:java}static int ServerImpls.CON_CHECK_INTERVAL = 500{code}

3. Remove additional, quickened connection checking.  Once we do fix 1, this will become even more useless.
Despite TCP discovery has a period of connection checking, it may send ping before this period exhausts. This premature ping relies also on the time of any received message for some reason. 

4. Do not worry user with “Node seems disconnected” when everything is OK. Once we do fix 1 and 3, this will become even more useless. 
Node may log on INFO: “Local node seems to be disconnected from topology …” whereas it is not actually disconnected at all.
