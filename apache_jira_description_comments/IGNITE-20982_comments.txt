About one-line comments: there is a specific use case when we write parameterized tests which are parameterized with an enum, so we have something like

enum {

    A(…),

    B(…),

    C(…)

}

Then, it turns out that for B the test is flaky (but not for other members), so we comment B out with a TODO:

enum {

    A(…),

    // TODO: IGNITE-XXX fix this.

    //B(…),

    C(…)

}

Here, the line with commented-out B does not end with a period, so it seems to violate your suggestion about one-line comments. Is it possible to address this, or we’ll have to add an artificial period?
