A lot of people working on Hadoop don't want to run all the tests when they develop; only the bits they're working on. Surefire 2.19 introduced more useful test filters which let us run a subset of the tests that brings the build time down from 'come back tomorrow' to 'grab a coffee'.

For instance, if I only care about the S3 adaptor, I might run:

{code}
mvn test -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Pdist,native -Djava.awt.headless=true \"-Dtest=org.apache.hadoop.fs.*, org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.*, org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.*\"
{code}

We can work around this by specifying the surefire version on the command line but it would be better, imo, to just update the default surefire used.

{code}
mvn test -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Pdist,native -Djava.awt.headless=true \"-Dtest=org.apache.hadoop.fs.*, org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.*, org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.*\" -Dmaven-surefire-plugin.version=2.19.1
{code}
