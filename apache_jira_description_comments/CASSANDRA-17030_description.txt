In order to GRANT or REVOKE multiple permissions we are currently forced to execute multiple requests. For example:
{code}
GRANT MODIFY ON KEYSPACE field TO manager;
GRANT SELECT ON KEYSPACE field TO manager;
{code}

We should be able to perform the same operations on a single request
{code}
GRANT MODIFY, SELECT ON KEYSPACE field TO manager;
{code}
