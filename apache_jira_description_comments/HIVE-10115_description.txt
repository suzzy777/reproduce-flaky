In a Kerberized cluster when alternate authentication is enabled on HS2, it should also accept Kerberos Authentication. The reason this is important is because when we enable LDAP authentication HS2 stops accepting delegation token authentication. So we are forced to enter username passwords in the oozie configuration.
The whole idea of SASL is that multiple authentication mechanism can be offered. If we disable Kerberos(GSSAPI) and delegation token (DIGEST) authentication when we enable LDAP authentication, this defeats SASL purpose.
