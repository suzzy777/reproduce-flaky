There are a couple of problems with the balloon framework that prevent it from being deployed (easily) on an actual cluster:

* The framework accepts 100% of memory in an offer.  This means the expected behavior (finish or OOM) is dependent on the offer size.
* The framework assumes the {{balloon-executor}} binary is available on each agent.  This is generally only true in the build environment or in single-agent test environments.
* The framework does not specify CPUs with the executor.  This is required by many isolators.
* The executor's {{TASK_FINISHED}} logic path was untested and is flaky.
* The framework has no metrics.
* The framework only launches a single task and then exits.  With this behavior, we can't have useful metrics.
