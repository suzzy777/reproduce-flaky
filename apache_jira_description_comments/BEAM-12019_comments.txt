I'm trying to reproduce this error, but the link above doesn't exist anymore, can you help me to reproduce it [~tvalentyn]? Or you know what's the current status of this issue?

I believe Jenkins only stores 2 weeks worth of runs, but you can find new runs on https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_PVR_Flink_Commit/. For example,
https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_PVR_Flink_Commit/3814/ seems to have these errors.

Thanks for looking into this issue, [~AlexRodriguez].

Oh, sorry [~tvalentyn], my team and I are making a general revision of flake issues and identify some obsolete ones, so we can prioritize and work on some of them. You can help me with this?

[~AlexRodriguez] I see one in the phrase job about a month ago, is that the furthest failure? https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_PVR_Flink_Phrase/139/
