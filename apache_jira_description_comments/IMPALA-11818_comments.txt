IMPALA-11818: Fix flaky TestDdlStatements.test_describe_materialized_view

This test is executed on multiple ImpalaDs serially. This caused some
race condition between the CREATE/DROP database statements, the test
could fail with "Database does not exist". This commit adds SYNC_DDL to
the test, so the CREATE/DROP db wonâ€™t return till the metadata is
propagated to each ImpalaDs.

Testing:
 - Could not trigger the failure locally, but ran the test
