[~drohrer] could you review as you were the one who reported the issue?
[~ifesdjeen] could you also review?

+1, LGTM. I suppose repro should be rather simple; should we add a test?

I'm also OK to remove cluster generation alltogether; just keep in mind we should do it in all branches (this patch has to be committed to all branches, too).

{quote}should we add a test?{quote}

 

The issue happens when the second cluster created in the JVM attempts to monitor the kill request; to replicate this in a single DC we would need to create a cluster, then create a second cluster, attempt to cause the first node to be killed (disk failure policy), then wait for the failure to propagate.  

 

I don't think that test would add a lot of value, and the current test infrastructure is able to detect this and cause periodic failures; making the test flaky at the moment.  I am in favor of not adding a new test for this, but relying on the fact that the test stop being flaky.  [~ifesdjeen] sound good to you?

 

This test was added by CASSANDRA-15332 which was not back ported to the 3.x branches.  In order to get this patch to apply in 3.x we would first need to back port CASSANDRA-15332.  Speaking to [~ifesdjeen] it sounds like we want 3.x and 4.x dtests to share the same API, so we should first backport CASSANDRA-15332 before applying this patch to 3.x.

Will file a Jira to backport

+1 for not adding test. Patch LGTM as-is.

Thank you for filing a jira for back port, too!

Committed only to trunk, under assumption that other branches are going to be fixed with a correct back ported version: [8f355ca2c25836784085f55eb464ad12ffaa1716|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/8f355ca2c25836784085f55eb464ad12ffaa1716]
