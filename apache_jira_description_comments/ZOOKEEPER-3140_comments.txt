A note on future work - it would be cool to see the serialized format of the QuorumVerifier (used for the dynamic config files and the like) updated to a more extensible form so we can track more topology and port information through it. This would give us a lot more flexibility in setting and propagating the observer master port, in particular in letting each server publish its own port instead of requiring a single static port for the whole ensemble. Would also be useful for purposes such as ZOOKEEPER-3166.

I thought there was an existent Jira on this requested change but didn't see one in a cursory search. I will create one specifically eventually, if I get the time. :)

Thanks for the great feature, [~enixon]

I am wondering if you have any performance data that you can share with the community. Based on the comment, it looks like the performance benefits will be seen when scaling an ensemble from hundreds to thousands of observers. 

We have done some perf test with the following ensembles and didn't see much difference. 

1) 5 participants and 5 observers
2) 5 participants and 30 observers 

It doesn't look like that there is a metrics for measuring the time that observers finish sync and start serving client traffic. How do you think adding one (observer_sync_time) just like what we have for follower (i.e. follower_sync_time)

Thanks,

Li

Some updates on the perf test results.

The performance results are very similar with the feature enabled vs disabled. However, with 30 observers, we did see some improvements on the write operation.

I have opened a JIRA ticket for the observer_sync_time. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-4284

Best,

Li

[~liwang], while I was with Facebook I did not get any numbers cleared for public release and I've since left the company so I no longer have access to performance data to share. 

For metrics, I'd recommend looking at write times with large number of observers (exactly as you did) and sync times after leader election or failure. I'd say you're on the right track here with your new ticket.
