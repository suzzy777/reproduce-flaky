IMPALA-7840: add missing error to test_concurrent_schema_change

test_concurrent_schema_change runs a series of alters and inserts on
the same Kudu table concurrently to ensure that Impala can handle this
without crashing.

There is a list of expected error messages in the test. One possible
legitimate error is missing, causing the test to sometimes be flaky.

This patch adds that error message to the test.
