HBASE-20819 prepared us for HBase 3.x by removing usages of the deprecated HTableDescriptor and HColumnDescriptor classes from the shell. However, it did use two methods from the ModifiableTableDescriptor, which was only public for compatibility/migration and was marked with {{@InterfaceAudience.Private}}. When {{ModifiableTableDescriptor}} was made private last week by HBASE-24507 it broke two hbase-shell commands (*describe* and *alter* when used to set a coprocessor) that were using methods from {{ModifiableTableDescriptor}} (these methods are not present on the general {{TableDescriptor}} interface).

This story will remove the two references in hbase-shell to methods on the now-private {{ModifiableTableDescriptor}} class and will find appropriate replacements for the calls.
