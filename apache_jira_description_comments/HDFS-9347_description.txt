The code
{code:title=TestTestQuorumJournalManager.java|borderStyle=solid}
@After
  public void shutdown() throws IOException {
    IOUtils.cleanup(LOG, toClose.toArray(new Closeable[0]));
    
    // Should not leak clients between tests -- this can cause flaky tests.
    // (See HDFS-4643)
    GenericTestUtils.assertNoThreadsMatching(".*IPC Client.*");
    
    if (cluster != null) {
      cluster.shutdown();
    }
  }
{code}
implicitly assumes when the call returns from IOUtils.cleanup() (which calls close() on QuorumJournalManager object), all IPC client connection threads are terminated. However, there is no internal implementation that enforces this assumption. Even if the bug reported in HADOOP-12532 is fixed, the internal code still only ensures IPC connections are terminated, but not the thread.
