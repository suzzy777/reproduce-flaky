{color:#000000}We’ve long had flakiness in our containerized ASF CI environment that we don’t see in circleci. The environment itself is both containerized and heterogenous, so there are differences in both the hardware environment and the software environment in which it executes. For reference, see: [https://github.com/apache/cassandra-builds/blob/trunk/ASF-jenkins-agents.md#current-agents]{color}

{color:#000000}We should log a variety of hardware, container, and software environment details to help get to the bottom of where some test failures may be occurring. As we don’t have shell access to the machines it’ll be easier to have this information logged / retrieved during test runs than to try and profile each host independently.{color}
