I've modified the tests to take into account only test triggered compactions for assertions.

[~e.dimitrova]Â you might want to review this when you have some free cycles? Thanks

Sure, I will check it later today. Thanks for looking into this one!

I have to complete something before I look into this one. But in order to mark myself as a reviewer(and prevent some confusion), I had to press "start review"
Will come back to this one probably later today

LGTM but I wanna look at the CI tomorrow. 

[~fcofdezc] unfortunately there is a bug preventing me from seeing your results in circleCI. It shows 0 jobs in the workflow run.
Can you, please, attach screenshots? 


Can you see the results using this [link|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/fcofdez/cassandra?branch=CASSANDRA-15671]?

Hi, now it is fine, thank you!
The patch LGTM. Thanks!
Only thing is I am not a committer.
[~brandon.williams] can you, please, check and commit this one? Thanks in advance!

Committed, thanks!
