Is this flakeyness in the Bq client itself? Perhaps we should retry this a bit. Does the direct runner retry it?
 *04:14:50* SEVERE: ***~ Channel ManagedChannelImpl\{logId=3, target=bigquerystorage.googleapis.com:443} was not shutdown properly!!!* *~**04:14:50* Make sure to call shutdown()/shutdownNow() and wait until awaitTermination() returns true.*04:14:50* java.lang.RuntimeException: ManagedChannel allocation site
  

In this code, we catch and rethrow it.

Or it may the case that this call just gets blocked for a long time, then the test times out and cancels this code, which causes the  exception to me thrown

Codepath is fairly new

[~reuvenlax] Would you mind taking a look, and making a change if you can confirm this is the issue.

I suspect either the call to  return BigQueryWriteClient.create() need some improved retry logic for this case. Or this call was hanging for a long time

This comes from the nightly snapshot build
https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostRelease_NightlySnapshot/1409/

This issue is assigned but has not received an update in 30 days so it has been labeled "stale-assigned". If you are still working on the issue, please give an update and remove the label. If you are no longer working on the issue, please unassign so someone else may work on it. In 7 days the issue will be automatically unassigned.

This is still happening frequently. [~reuvenlax] could you please take a look, or reassign it?

Is the test failing or is it simply an error log?




The test fails most of the time (it's only passed 3 times out of the past 20+ runs). https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostRelease_NightlySnapshot/

[~kenn] - Would it make sense to sickbay this test? It still looks quite flaky.

Looks like this is still failing pretty aggressively:
https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostRelease_NightlySnapshot/1533/console

Yea happens way more than half the time.

I actually don't think BEAM-12793 is a dupe of this.

Reuven - you chatted me offline that the managedchannel issue was fixed.
