Currently Ignite relies on deferred delete buffer in order to handle write-remove conflicts during rebalance. Given the limit size of the buffer, this approach is fundamentally flawed, especially in case when persistence is enabled.

I suggest to extend the logic of data storage to be able to store key tombstones - to keep version for deleted entries. The tombstones will be stored when rebalance is in progress and should be cleaned up when rebalance is completed.

Later this approach may be used to implement fast partition rebalance based on merkle trees (in this case, tombstones should be written on an incomplete baseline).
