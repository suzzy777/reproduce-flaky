It has been seen that the operator e2e tests were flaky when used the latest version of the busybox so we've pinned it to a relatively old version. https://github.com/apache/flink-kubernetes-operator/commit/8e41ed5ec1adda9ae06bc0b6203abf42939fbf2b

It would be good to do 2 things
* Upgrade the busybox version to the latest in a pinned way
* Add debug logs of the busybox pod in case of failure (to see why failed)
