Backport SPARK-25692       Remove static initialization of worker eventLoop handling chunk fetch requests within TransportContext. This fixes ChunkFetchIntegrationSuite as well.

While the test was only flaky in the 3.0 branch, it seems possible the same code path could be triggered in 2.4 so consider for backport.
