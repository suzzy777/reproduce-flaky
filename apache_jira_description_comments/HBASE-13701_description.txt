HBASE-12052 makes SecureBulkLoadEndpoint work in a non-secure env to solve HDFS permission issues.
We have encountered some of the permission issues and have to use this SecureBulkLoadEndpoint to workaround issues.
We should  probably consolidate SecureBulkLoadEndpoint into HBase core as default for bulk load since it is able to handle both secure Kerberos and non-secure cases.
Maintaining two versions of bulk load implementation is also a cause of confusion, and having to explicitly set it is also inconvenient.
