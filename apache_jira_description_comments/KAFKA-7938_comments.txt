   Address the comments on PR-6307. Sorry for new PR, but one of the comments was to move the PR to another branch.
   
   ****
   This attempts to fix KAFKA-7938 and KAFKA-7946.
   
   I removed two tests:
   
   * testDeleteWithShortInitialization basically didn't check the result and therefore always passed
   * testDeleteCmdWithShortInitialization has no way to enforce that initialization is indeed short, and therefore sometimes FAILED because the group would be created before the CMD tried to delete it.
   
   I thought the tests had limited value relative to the effort of figuring out a way to make the timing work.
   
   I also fixed testDeleteCmdNonEmptyGroup and testDeleteNonEmptyGroup so they will validate that the group both exists and is non-empty before starting the test itself. I also added some extra information for future debugging sessions :)
   
   I ran the tests LOTS of times to validate, but with flaky tests, it is hard to tell :)
