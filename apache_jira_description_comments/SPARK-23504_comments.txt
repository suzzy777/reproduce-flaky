I noticed this happening too, but I've been unable to reproduce it locally after hundreds of runs.

Experienced the [same problem|https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/88605/testReport/org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming/RateSourceV2Suite/basic_microbatch_execution/].

We've replaced the hacky RateSourceV2 implementation with a proper one in [https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20688|https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20688,]. I'm going to keep track of this for a bit longer, but hopefully it will be gone now.

The test run posted appears to be very old - the most recent pull request builder is 90838. Unless there's a more recent example, I think I'd stand by my claim that PR 20688 solved the problem.

Closing this for now based on the above comment.
