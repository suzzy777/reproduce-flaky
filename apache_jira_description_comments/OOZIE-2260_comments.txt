test case failure is flaky one,  ran it locally and confirmed it works.
committed to master,  thanks for review

turned out that OOZIE-2260 caused some test cases to fail when run against -Phadoop-2.   this amend patch to fix them.

bq. File MAPREDUCE-6576, so that this issue is fixed in hadoop itself in future
   Closed that one as duplicate as I had already filed it long back (MAPREDUCE-6472 and TEZ-2787) and they are fixed.

Closing issue; Oozie 4.3.0 is released.
