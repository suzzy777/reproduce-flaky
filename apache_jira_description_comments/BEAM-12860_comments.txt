Hi Brian, I din't find an issue tracking this - perhaps this is a new error? Previous issues with this test: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12764

Another error: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Python38/1654/testReport/junit/apache_beam.examples.dataframe.taxiride_it_test/TaxirideIT/test_aggregation/

Also: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Python37/4244/testReport/junit/apache_beam.examples.dataframe.flight_delays_it_test/FlightDelaysTest/test_flight_delays/

Same as previously, the error is generic, we need to find the job id to look at.

Error Message
E       AssertionError: Pipeline execution failed.
E       assert 'FAILED' in ('DONE', 'CANCELLED')

Poor logging also tracked in BEAM-5492. It could be that the pipeline ran out of quota.

I see flakes for other DataFrame integration tests in Postcommit as well, it seems likely this is a quota issue. I'm not sure how to confirm though, no job ids in the log. I tried paging through the failed jobs in the cloud console but can't find the relevant jobs.

It seems this test has recovered now that we've increased quota
