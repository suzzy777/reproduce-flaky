    Looks great to me, thank you @praagarw 
    Merging to only to master, if there is no further discussion
    
    Or do you think we should also apply this to upcoming 0.6.1 as well?

    I can do that. What branch should I use for 0.6.1?
    
    I merged with latest master this morning. Two checks in the build failed. Any ideas how to fix? I am going to restart the build in case they are due to flaky tests.

    @prasadwagle Thanks for the fix!
    LGTM. I don't think it's blocker for 0.6.1 release, but it will be nice if we can include it in 0.6.1 release.


Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    merge into master and branch-0.6 if there're no more discussions.
