There are currently two Jenkins jobs:

https://builds.apache.org/job/Kafka-trunk
https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-trunk-git-pr

They both run with Java 7 and execute the following gradle commands:

./gradlew -PscalaVersion=2.10.1 test
./gradlew -PscalaVersion=2.11 test

There are a few issues with this:
* We don't test Java 8 even though that's the only stable release of the JDK that still receives security fixes
* We are testing with Scala 2.10.1 even though we should be testing with Scala 2.10.5
* We are not doing clean builds
* The versions tested are defined in Jenkins instead of the build

I suggest the following:

1. Change the `kafka-trunk-git-pr` job to use the `./gradlew clean testAll` command.
2. Change the `Kafka-trunk` job to use the `./gradlew clean jarAll docsJarAll testAll` command.
3. Introduce a kafka-trunk-jdk8 job with the command `./gradlew clean jarAll docsJarAll testAll`

We only test the PR job against Java 7 as it's executed much more often than the trunk job.
