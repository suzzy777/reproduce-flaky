The cache restarts suite has interrupted with fail. One of the reason is:
{code:java}
Stopping local node on Ignite failure: [failureCtx=FailureContext [type=SEGMENTATION, err=null]]{code}
It happens because the suite has the property: System.setProperty(IgniteSystemProperties.IGNITE_ENABLE_FORCIBLE_NODE_KILL, "true"); 

There isn't a reason for it in this test.
