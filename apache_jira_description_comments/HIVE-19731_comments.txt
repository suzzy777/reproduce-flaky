[~ashutoshc], could you review? This one fixes a flaky test, no need to wait for QA to check it in. Thanks

+1
It seems like this might be a common issue. Would it be useful to have a common test utility method for updating these settings ? It doesn't have to be part of this patch though.


[~thejas], thanks. I agree... We should have a more comprehensive way of doing this. We have already identified quite a few conf objects that use default staging directory... In a follow-up, the code could be refactored so all these tests call to same method that given the test name, sets the correct value for the conf properties.

Pushed to master, branch-3.

Created HIVE-19732 for the follow-up.
