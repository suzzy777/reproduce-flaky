Attaching patch that removes all the permissions inheritance logic. I suspect there will be some test failures.

Thanks [~stakiar] for working on this. Can you please create a RB for this?

[~ashutoshc] RB: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-16392

Brief Summary:

* Deleted the config {{HIVE_WAREHOUSE_SUBDIR_INHERIT_PERMS}} - removed all usage of it
* Deleted the inheritPerms parameter of a few methods in {{FileUtils}}
* Changes to {{Hive.java}} ({{moveFile}}, {{copyFiles}}, etc.) to remove permissions inheritance logic
* Deleted a few tests that validated that permissions inheritance was working

+1 
Would also like to point out that user may also choose SQLStdAuth which ships with Hive if user doesn't want to use external security system.

Test failures are flaky:

HIVE-16345 - TestBeeLineDriver.testCliDriver[drop_with_concurrency]
HIVE-16320 - TestBeeLineDriver.testCliDriver[escape_comments]
HIVE-16387 - TestJdbcDriver2.testResultSetMetaData
HIVE-15535 - TestHS2HttpServer.testContextRootUrlRewrite

Should be ready to push.

Pushed to master. Thanks, Sahil!

Doc note:  The removal of *hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms* needs to be documented in the wiki.  It would be good to mention the use of external security systems and include Ashutosh's comment "user may also choose SQLStdAuth which ships with Hive if user doesn't want to use external security system."

Also, the wiki says that when *hive.files.umask.value* was removed in 0.9.0, it was replaced by *hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms* -- perhaps that should be updated too.

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms]
* [Configuration Properties -- hive.files.umask.value | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.files.umask.value]

Added a TODOC3.0 label.

I updated the wikis for the config hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms, I'm not sure if hive.files.umask.value really needs to be updated. I also updated the https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Permission+Inheritance+in+Hive wiki.

Hmm... this makes permission management more complex for ppl still using FS based permissions. Is there particular reason to remove this? We could just have it false by default. cc [~ashutoshc]

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
