[~vjasani] Since you worked on HDFS-15940, Do you know if the failures in branch-2.10 were the same as the ones that triggered HDFS-15940?

Apologies [~ahussein], I should have added stacktrace of flaky failures on HDFS-15940. IIRC, I have seen IllegalThreadStateException in a couple of flaky tests that I was looking into, most likely this might be the one. In any case, I believe we should backport refactoring of tests from HDFS-15940. This refactor was major relief AFAIK and I haven't seen test failure after this patch.

Thanks [~vjasani] for the update. I appreciate it.
No worries at all.

Since we are not 100% positive it both branches had the same errors. I will keep this jira opened.
I will try to take a look at the refactor done in HDFS-15940 and see if it is applicable to back port it to 2.10.
