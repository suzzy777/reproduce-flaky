Hey [~jpoth], it looks like some of the tests are still flaky due to the changes: [https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Camel/job/Apache%20Camel/job/main/211/testReport/. |https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Camel/job/Apache%20Camel/job/main/211/testReport/]

 

If you have a chance, is it possible to take a look, please?

Hi [~orpiske]! Looks like they were failing before too? https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Camel/job/Apache%20Camel/job/main/203/

There's definitely a problem though. I'll try to take a look!

Hi!

 

[~jpoth] I think the problematic ones are just the health check and the topic pattern ones. I fixed the idempotent tests. The manual one looks like an environment issue and not related to your change - at least I can't reproduce it here.

And thanks for looking at those!

Is all of this done now?

Yep, closing ...
