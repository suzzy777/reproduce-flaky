On version 3.4.10, I am seeing a similar issue to what has been reported in this ticket. That is every minute or so, my zookeeper records the following stack trace in the log. Is the message *IOException: Received packet with invalid packet*  followed by a *Interrupting SendWorker* a real issue or is it just a FYI warning message (that is, the underlying zookeeper cluster is fine)? This is logged on each of the node in the cluster. Just to be clear, sending stat command to my nodes works fine.

Verified a bunch of recent builds, test is not failing anymore. Closing.
