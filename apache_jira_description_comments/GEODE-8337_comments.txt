   I'm re-running DistributedTestOpenJDK11. It failed a client backward-compatibility test due to a log4j bug in Geode 1.8.0: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-8345

   because git didn't notice the renaming: Version->KnownVersion, VersionOrdinal->Version as renaming, I'm closing this PR. Here's a better one where I explictly used `git mv` and separated the two renamings in two commits: https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5355

   @albertogpz for some reason I can't add you as a reviewer, but thought you might be interested in this, the "last" PR associated with GEODE-8240. This one finalizing the renaming of the types in the new versioning hierarchy (and the associated `Versioning` factory) etc.

   @Bill it might be because I am not a committer. Thanks for taking me into account because I am definitely interested.

   Thanks for the review @bschuchardt. I'm rewriting history on this PR now to get it down to the minimal number of commits (2). After CI runs on that I'll merge it!

   sorry about the confusion @bschuchardt…
   
   I had to revert due to test failures in proprietary code. No changes were needed to this code, as it turns out. But it's taken me a long time to fix that proprietary code. I believe I have it fixed now.
   
   There are no unapproved changes in this PR. It's merely cherry-picking (commits for) two formerly approved PRs.
