Hey [~mgrigorov]

Thanks for reporting it. Oozie on ARM64 is quite new to me. Dev and test environment are only x86_64 ones so if you are working on ARM64 environment then please share your fix. What device do you actually have? Apple M1? Raspberry PI? Other?

I am not sure if we have such environment to test on but if the changes you propose to fix build and test on ARM64 do not cause regression then those changes are very welcome.

Thanks,

Denes

Hi [~dionusos] !

Thanks for the quick response!

I am still debugging the issue with TestPyspark.

I will send a PR for the snappy-java version. It is small change and most probably won't affect others.

I test on Ubuntu 20.04.3 VM.

Is Oozie team interested in adding Linux ARM64 as a CI agent ? I could help providing a dedicated VM! What CI system does the project use ?

[https://github.com/apache/oozie/pull/61] - Pull Request for snappy-java

The problem with TestPyspark was that it was using Python 3.9 installed by Miniconda3.

Using the one installed from Ubuntu repos (python => 2.7.18) is fine!

Hey [~mgrigorov] 

Thanks for the details and the patch. Let me test your change in a different environment. I can do that next week.

Regarding Oozie patches: when you upload a patch file to the Jira a Jenkins job notices it and starts this: [https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/PreCommit-OOZIE-Build/] which runs the checks and tests using Maven. All the code used testin is in the Oozie repository. Pull requests are not used for Oozie, but this could change in the future.

Let's discuss this topic on [dev@oozie.apache.org|mailto:dev@oozie.apache.org] list. I think it would be a good idea to support other architecture out of box. Right now Oozie is capable of running on any machine if there is Java installed so only the low level libs can be different. Should we pack all of them with Oozie and pray not to cause issues or create a new build profile which selects the low level dependencies at build time? I think we should discuss this topic.
Currently Oozie uses the CI provided by Apache: automatic build, tests and code check runs against every patch uploaded to the Jiras.
