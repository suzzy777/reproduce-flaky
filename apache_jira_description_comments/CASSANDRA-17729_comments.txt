4.1 branch link doesn't appear to be valid

^Ah well yes apologies. It works better if you actually link sthg to it :-)

[~jmckenzie] mentioned on the ML:

{quote}Another option would be to increase the resources dedicated to each agent container and run less in parallel. Or, best yet, do both (up timeouts and lower parallelization / up resources).

As far as I can tell the failures on Jenkins aren't value-add compared to what we're seeing on circleci and are just generating busywork.

There's a reasonable discussion to be had about "what's the smallest footprint of hardware we consider C* supported on" and targeting ASF CI to validate that. I believe the noisy env + low resources on ASF CI currently are lower than whatever floor we'd reasonably agree on.{quote}

I agree more resources would be great. And we're now on a degraded situation while some workers are offline getting their 'full HDD' issues fixed. Also setting some HW baseline seems like a good point.

On the other hand I can't stop finding legit bugs on jenkins runs. Being a contended env, as opposed to circle, many bugs that circle would never show come up in jenkins. The problem is being able to find those within all the noise in jenkins. That's why it is so important to get to green and _keep it_ like that. Otherwise the noise hides the legit failures.

Agree with the notion that Jenkins (lower resources/more contention) is better at exposing flakies, but that there's a trade-off between encouraging flakies and creating difficult-to-deal-with noise.

While I'm for raising the discussion about what is the base hardware requirement (once HDD issues are resolved and all agents are active again), I don't see this as an argument not to continuously improve tests to be more robust. So +1 to the patch.

You're seeing bugs showing up in Jenkins that don't show in circle that users could expect to see in a reasonably provisioned C* cluster?

Through all the reviews and tests fixes I have done all this time there are plenty that will only repro on circle or only on jenkins, yes. And I think that is shared pov if you ask at least in my team.  It is common for me to be involved in tickets that only repro on jenkins. In fact the jenkins run in this ticket is showing a few that don't show on the matching circle run.

How this would relate to a 'properly' provisioned cluster, which we would have to define, I can't tell. I see your point right, bc there are some snakes in the grass, but If they are only doing noise is sthg to discuss as in any dist environment you will have timeouts and resource contraints. But at the moment jenkins is our official CI so any bugs there need ironing iiuc.

i.e CASSANDRA-17232 is sthg that comes up in jenkins a lot. On circle we only get it looping the test a1000 times and with difficulty.

bq. at the moment jenkins is our official CI so any bugs there need ironing 
In my mind there's a distinction between a "test bug" and a "product bug". I don't deny we have many of the former, but we may not agree on the relative value of spending time fixing things that only show up in highly contended, lowly provisioned test runtime environments.

Let's continue this discussion on the dev ML thread?

Unrelated errors imo

Thanks [~mck] and the rest for the help here!
