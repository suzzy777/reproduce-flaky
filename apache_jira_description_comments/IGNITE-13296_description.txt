~TransactionImpl potentially throws an exception (e.g. when grid is stopped), causing the entire process to abort.
GetLocalActiveTransactions is especially problematic - the method is informational, yet will result in all the returned transactions to be finalized later.

* Finalizers should not throw exceptions
* Stopped grid is a valid use case
* GetLocalActiveTransactions should be fixed to return "read-only" transactions that won't be finalized

Review all filalizers and make sure they are safe.
