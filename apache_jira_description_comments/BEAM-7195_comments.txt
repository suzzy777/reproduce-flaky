Has anyone taken a look at this [~chamikara]?

This could be related to a flaky Python Post commit test

I am able to reproduce this in 2.19 and 2.24 Java SDK.

The root cause is that new tables are sometimes not being created when using DynamicDestinations[1] due to a "GroupOntoSingleton" in BatchLoads[2].

Some more details:

The bug is that BigQueryIO assumed that Reshuffle would produce pane indices like a GroupByKey would. However Reshuffle merely forwards whatever pane indices already existed, and in this case those were produced by the previous GroupByKey onto a singleton. The PR fixes this by making sure that the prior GroupByKey groups by destination instead of by singleton.

Could we close this? Is that PR got merged?

The PRs weren't merged yet. This seems like it may be causing our nightly snapshot tests to flake as well:
