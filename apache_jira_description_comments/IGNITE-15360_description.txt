verify-nuget.ps1 fails if .NET 5 is installed:

{code}
error: NU1101: Unable to find package System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager. No packages exist with this id in source(s): C:\BuildAgent\work\7bc1c54bc719b67c\modules\platforms\dotnet\nupkg
{code}

Looks like NuGet restore behavior has changed in .NET 5 when "-s" option is present and it can't find ConfigurationManager on Nuget.org when a custom source is specified.
