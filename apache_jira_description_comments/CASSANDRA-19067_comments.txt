The test searches the replacement node log for messages matching the pattern:
{code:java}
replmnt_address = self.replacement_node.address_for_current_version_slashy()
repled_address = self.replaced_node.address_for_current_version_slashy()
token_ownership_log = r"Token (.*?) changing ownership from {} to {}".format(repled_address, replmnt_address)
{code}
The logs from the test run on circle show that this was logged as expected:
{code:java}
WARN  [OptionalTasks:1] 2023-11-23 21:18:56,535 LegacyStateListener.java:146 - Token 3074457345618258602 changing ownership from /127.0.0.3:7000 to /127.0.0.4:7000
{code}
Â but it appears as though it now may appear slightly later after node startup than previously. I suspect this makes the test slightly flaky as the message may not have appeared before the grep is performed. I have a dtest patch to make this more predictable and will attach soon.
