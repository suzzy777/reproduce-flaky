As the whole {{bin/*}} [*is outside {{apache-rat-plugin}} s range*|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/pom.xml#L1924], it's a false alarm. [~gezapeti] [~pbacsko] can you pls. take a look?

Thanks for the patch [~andras.piros]! 
We're having builds like the last one in OOZIE-1770, with lots of false alarms in the report.
Could you tweak this step to make it more robust somehow? Do you have guesses why this is happening?

New patch that addresses flakiness by issuing:
{noformat}
mvn clean compile test-compile findbugs:check -Dfindbugs.failOnError=false -Dcheckstyle.failOnViolation=false
{noformat}

Again, as the whole {{bin/*}} [*is outside {{apache-rat-plugin}} s range*|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/pom.xml#L1924], it's a false alarm.

Ooops.
Attaching amend patch for it.

[~gezapeti]  I think this can be committed directly without any amend patch. Otherwise, we can take care of this into our next commit. Thanks.

[~gezapeti] I have pushed the contributor change into release-log, in the this commit: https://github.com/apache/oozie/commit/7c404ad0ea4c61e90e8c86015de25ef196168c29

Thanks. 

Thanks for fixing it [~abhishekbafna]!
