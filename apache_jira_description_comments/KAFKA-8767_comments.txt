see related: flaky test PR [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7503]

Note that since https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9987, this problem only affects the case in which the consumers in the group have different subscriptions. Most consumer groups don't have varying subscriptions, rather each member subscribes to the same set of topics/patterns and lets the assignor work out the distribution. For those groups with equal subscriptions across all members, the assignment is always maximally sticky (while still balanced) and therefore it's not possible for it to misplace the revoked partitions and result in an extra cooperative rebalance being required in order to assign all partitions.

I'll leave this ticket open since it does still affect a small minority of consumer groups, but it's probably not worth fixing at this point.
