[~mjsax] [~bchen225242] Some of these tests in particular have insane failure rates...can (at least) 12 times in 2 days even be called flaky anymore? Seems like the flaky part is that it sometimes passes. At what point do we ping the responsible team to do something...

[~ableegoldman] if a test is failing very frequently and affecting your ability to contribute changes, please go ahead and submit a PR to disable it. This is a community project, the responsibility is shared by everyone.

I can reproduce the failure locally, let's see if I can fix it.

   The introduction of KIP-480: Sticky Producer Partitioner had the
   side effect that `generateAndProduceMessages` can often write
   messages to a lower number of partitions to improve batching.
   
   `testDescribeLogDirsRequest` (and potentially other tests) relies
   on the messages being written somewhat uniformly to the topic
   partitions. We fix the issue by including a monotonically
   increasing key in the produced messages.

Thanks for the quick fix [~ijuma].

thanks [~ijuma]! I didn't want to disable it in case it was surfacing a real issue :) 

Well. I think it did surface a real issue... :)

[~ableegoldman] If we disable a test, we should also create a blocker Jira for the next release until it's been triaged. If we never revert, the incentive to fix quickly is sometimes not there.
