Hmm. Surprised by this, and that it didn't show up before...? Checking.

Oh, wow. {{EndpointState}} is mutable, and we aren't copying it. Easy fix, anyway.

On these four runs I had consistent failures with dtests {{test_network_topology_strategy}} and {{{}test_network_topology_strategy_each_quorum{}}}.

Right on spot, I am just looking into this today, the ticket is CASSANDRA-18051. I was just discussing it with [~brandon.williams] in a chat. Those are large tests, and CASSANDRA-18127 was about upgrade tests
