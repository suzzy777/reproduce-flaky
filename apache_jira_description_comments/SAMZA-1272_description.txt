ZkCoordinationUtils has a _reset_ interface that deletes the entire Zk tree. 

The example application seems to work fine because only the _LocalApplicationRunner_ invokes it and the root gets created again. But this is not the expected behavior. The LocalApplicationRunner is responsible for creating the ZkRoot and every other component down the stack should work under this root.
