Hi,

I would like to see new zookeeper client (3.4.13) used in storm.

New release contains an important fixÂ for cloud environments where zookeeper servers have dynamic ips ([https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2184]).

If possible, it would be nice to see updated zookeeper also on older storm versions (1.2.x, 1.1.x)
