Are you starting it twice Jimmy?  Once in Master and once in RegionServer (on the combined RS+M node?)

In startCatalogTracker(), we make sure it is started only once. The tests work fine locally. They may be flaky.

I see.  You can call startCatalogTracker as much as you like, we'll only start once.  Good. +1.

Thanks for the review. Integrated it into trunk.

SUCCESS: Integrated in HBase-TRUNK #5088 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/5088/])
