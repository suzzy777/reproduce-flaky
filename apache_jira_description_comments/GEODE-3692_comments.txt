GEODE-3692: Add Flaky tag to intemittent test failure


The security manager is established in InternalDistributedSystem.initialize() before the server threads are created.  Sarge & I _think_ that this is establishing a security manager in SecurityUtils, which uses an unsynchronized non-volatile static variable to store the manager for later access.  This appears to have been null in the ServerConnection thread that threw the exception.  Perhaps some synchronization is needed around this variable, but it's in the Shiro library so we can't do this ourselves.

Somehow the Flaky category was removed from this test.  We're re-adding it.

GEODE-3692: Intermittent test failure: ClientAuthDUnitTest

Fixed tests that were depending on SecurityUtils.setSecurityManager().
These now use ThreadContext.bind() instead.


Since the problem surfaces as an NPE that prevents a login from being processed we don't think this is a security issue.  It's a bug but it won't allow anyone access without passing authentication.

GEODE-3692: Intermittent test failure: ClientAuthDUnitTest

Establish the shiro security manager in a thread before attempting
to get the security subject.


We're dropping the pull request but leaving the branch in place for now.  Jinmei wants to open a bug report for Shiro to fix the static variable problem.

Created a Shiro JIRA:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-648

During some initial investigation, it appears the core issue may be that we use {{    ThreadContext.remove();}} in the {{IntegratedSecurityService}} class.  This method fully-clears the ThreadContext, including the binding of our {{SecurityManager}}.  When a thread is later re-used, it may be this that is causing our NPE.

Suggested amelioration: refactor various uses of {{ThreadContext}} to use {{SubjectThreadState}} instead, particularly replacing {{ThreadContext.remove}} with {{SubjectThreadState.restore}}.

This issue has either failed to reproduce or been fixed systemically elsewhere (e.g. improving port selection and timeouts).  Closing but please reopen if needed.
