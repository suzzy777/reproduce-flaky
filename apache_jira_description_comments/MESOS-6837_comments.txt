Fixed test flakiness due to floating point conversions.

`FaultToleranceTest.FrameworkReregister` and
`MasterTest.FailoverAgentReregisterFirst` both examined a timestamp
value returned by an HTTP endpoint. Such values are the result of
several conversions (`double` to `string` to `JSON::Value`); this might
result in the returned value being an integer one larger/smaller than we
expect. Hence, make the comparison within an epsilon of 1.

A similar issue in `SlaveTest.StateEndpoint` was fixed in
595c929f2816b713b4c36ce1bd23a7767afe8135.
