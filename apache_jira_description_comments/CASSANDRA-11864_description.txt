This has started pretty consistently failing on 2.2+ on CI. I am not reproducing it locally though, so it is flaky. The failures all related to failed queries, whether they don't return data when they're expected to, or they time out.

example failure:

http://cassci.datastax.com/job/cassandra-3.0_dtest/710/testReport/thrift_tests/TestMutations/test_dynamic_indexes_with_system_update_cf

Failed on CassCI build cassandra-3.0_dtest #710

I expect this may be a bug, but someone should go in and bisect, or get slightly more useful debugging data.
