For any operators that hit this: another workaround is to temporarily raise {{write_request_timeout_in_ms}} in cassandra.yaml.

Thanks Tyler, this is syngularity.  If you need more details on my end please let me know.

The fix is relatively straightfoward.  Here are the patches and pending CI runs (the merge from 3.7 -> trunk was trivial):

I've also created a [dtest pull request|https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/998] that reproduces the issue and is fixed by the patch.

[~carlyeks] do you mind reviewing?

LGTM +1

Thanks.  All of the failing tests appear to be known failures or known flaky tests, so I've committed this to 3.0 as [{{5794fb3556a07a662a8a79cfd692eaa459e9066b}}|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/5794fb3556a07a662a8a79cfd692eaa459e9066b] and merged up to 3.7 and trunk.
