I would say let's fix the flaky tests first, and then delete the error builds for flaky and nightly, to regenerate the flaky list?

I thought the flakey test's reason is that:
 # Too many tests failed in one nightly job.
 # The flaky test job run thest tests but cannot finished in 2 hours.
 # Thest tests marked as flaky again.
 # Go back to 2. And cannot ok anymore.

Let's find out the error builds and delete them...

But you need to make sure the tests are OK...

I've deleted the broken builds for both nightly and flaky, now the list is smaller. Let's see whether it works.

Seems we do have a lot of failures? Let's fix them ASAP?
