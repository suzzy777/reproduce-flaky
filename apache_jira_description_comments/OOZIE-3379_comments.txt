Thanks for the contribution [~zuston]!

A couple of comments:
 # file length should be trimmed to 255 chars
 # if there is already a {{File}} with the same name, at least {{LOG.warn()}}
 # new unit test cases covering the new functionality should be created, explicitly testing for multiple {{AuthOozieClient}} instances in one JVM
 # instead of {{public static File}}, the auth token cache should be {{@VisibleForTesting final File}} that could be asserted in a unit test. In a JVM we can have multiple {{AuthOozieClient}} instances w/ multiple Oozie URLs, that's also why we should not use {{static}} here

[~zuston] to address the one remaining FindBugs warning, can you please put following annotation on the actual method (constructor) level ({{AuthOozieClient.java#L93-100}}):
{code:java}
@SuppressFBWarnings(value = "PATH_TRAVERSAL_IN", justification = "FilenameUtils is used to filter user input. JDK8+ is used.")
{code}

Can you please also add following {{FilenameUtils#getName()}} call when creating a new {{File}} given user input like this:
{code:java}
FilenameUtils.getFullPath(System.getProperty("user.home")) + FilenameUtils.getName(filename)
{code}
