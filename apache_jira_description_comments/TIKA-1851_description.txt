Let's try to move resources that are used for testing to the test-resources module if possible: MockParser, DummyParser, TikaTest and the unit tests for MockParser.  That should also allow us to drop the test-jar goal in tika-core.  Anything else?

Haven't actually tried this yet; there may be surprises.
