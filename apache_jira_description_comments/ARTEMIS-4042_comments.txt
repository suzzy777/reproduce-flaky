ARTEMIS-4042 - read sensitive string codec env var if system property is not set


I guess it would make sense to now modify the start scripts, to avoid the need to manually do it and not set the system property any more. [~jbertram] concur? In the last commit I wanted to have the capability with the minimal change, but I don't see any value in having the value now also in the system property.

[~gtully], I agree 100%.
