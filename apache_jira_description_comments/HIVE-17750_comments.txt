One of the tables in the new test that should probably remain ACID becomes insert-only due to HIVE-17878. When that is fixed the test output will be modified.


A small patch; most of the size is the test output.
[~hagleitn] can you review?

+1

Again for hiveqa

Test failures look unrelated. I will file a JIRA for llap_acid_fast test that seems to be flaky.

Committed to master. Thanks for the reviews!

Doc note:  This adds *hive.create.as.insert.only* to HiveConf.java, so it will need to be documented in the wiki, both in Configuration Properties and in whatever doc gets written for the umbrella jira HIVE-14535.

Configuration Properties will probably have a new subsection for insert-only ACID tables, but since it doesn't exist yet here's the general link:

* [Configuration Properties -- Query and DDL Execution | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-QueryandDDLExecution]

Added a TODOC3.0 label.

This jira is resolved and released with Hive 3.0 If you find an issue with it, please create a new jira.
