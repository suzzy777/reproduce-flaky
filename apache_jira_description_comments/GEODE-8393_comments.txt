I think this is a test issue and not a product issue. The test is configured to use lettuce and configures the connection to auto reconnect. This can cause the client to automatically redo an operation. When that happens we can end up with an unexpected 0 or 1. I'm working on fixing this test.

GEODE-8427: fix flaky test and do not throw memberDeparted (#5446)

* disabled test due to GEODE-8393
* SessionDUnitTests now use lettuce instead of jedis
This allows them to auto reconnect when servers go down
* fixed exception handling in test


This test has been disabled (in

4637498e1f933d13f298b10b65dbc2af776c5c98)

until we can figure out why it fails intermittently

   - There seems to be an intermittent problem when Deltas arrive and a GII
     is in progress. This fix introduces a sequence number that is used for
     APPEND operations only. Since APPEND is NOT idempotent, duplicate
     deltas are a problem and will cause data issues if applied when they
     should not be.
