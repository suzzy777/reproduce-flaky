I tested in `a1.4xlarge` and I cannot reproduce the failure. I'd like to recommend to use more powerful machines like `a1.4xlarge` for testing.

Please see the discussion on the PR.

Looks like it is flaky in Amplab PR builder.

Would it be better to file a new issue to track this?

Since this is not `Closed` status, you can reopen this with that new information, [~kabhwan].

Thanks for guiding. I'll reopen this with updating the info.

Reopening since it's also occurred from Amplab CI.

Somehow I createdÂ SPARK-29139 and submitted a patch. As this was resolved once, please let me resolve this again and go further with SPARK-29139.
