Smooth decrease of the write speed in WAL when approaching the exhaustion of current segments in the working directory.

Now archiver segment switch involves file copying and may be bottleneck of speed of grid operation.

Now if out of work segments occurs, grid put speed drop down to 0 ops/sec ocurred.

This isssue was fixed under IGNITE-7017 with providing new 'NoArchvier' mode, but in case archiver based WAL is already used by end-user, it is required to have opportunity to smooth decrease speed instead of drop to 0.
