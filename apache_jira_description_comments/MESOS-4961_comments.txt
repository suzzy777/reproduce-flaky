    Fixed flakiness in  ContainerLoggerTest.LOGROTATE_RotateInSandbox.
    
    This removes a race between the test and the global `ReapProcess`, which were
    originally both calling `waitpid` on the logger subprocesses.  The test now
    defers the reaping to the `ReapProcess` and just waits for all logger
    subprocesses to exit naturally via `os::exists(pid)`.
    
    Since the `ReapProcess` reaps on an interval, a `Clock::advance` was inserted to
    skip the reap delay.
