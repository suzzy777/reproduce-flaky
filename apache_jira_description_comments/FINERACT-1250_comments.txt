> I'm not sure if or it could be related to the move

FYI why I think it's actually related to the PR is because a trivial other change like https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1484 actually had a green build (see https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/740541274) where all ITs passed. So unless it's just "flaky", this does seem to be caused by that PR.. I'll close and re-open it to get a 2nd build, but I suspect we'll see it still fail in the same way.

[~aleks] FYI https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/740585929 also failed in the same test, so this is definitely not just flaky but broken in https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1465...

[~vorburger] I think I found it... the problem was the Travis command line. There are 2 Gradle commands executed; the first is - I think - supposed to check that all rules (RAT, Spotless, license headers etc.) are applied and the second one was executing the integration test. Now that the integration tests are in their own module and are just defined as "normal" tests they get actually executed twice, because the first Gradle command also executes all unit tests (which includes the integration-tests module). I think I've fixed this by adding a "-x test" to the first command, just to keep the change as minimal as possible. But I'm sure we don't need these two commands anymore and could later merge them into one. Just FYI.

The tests were running twice due to a wrong Travis command line.
