Fixed flaky `ROOT_CGROUPS_RecoverLauncherOrphans` test.

Containerizer recovery returns control to the caller before completion
of destruction of orphaned containers. Previously, `wait` was called on
a container right after calling `recover`, so `wait` was almost always
successfull, because destruction of the orphaned container takes some
time to complete.

This patch replaces check for the container existence with the check
that a related freezer cgroup has been destroyed. The freezer cgroup
is destroyed during container destruction initiated by a containerizer
recovery process.
