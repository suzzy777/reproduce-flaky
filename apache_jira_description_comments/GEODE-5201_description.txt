DUnit and Integration tests are expensive to run.Â While working on a particular component, I want a way to only run tests directly related to that component. Categorizing these tests will enable that and also allow for pipeline jobs dedicated to a specific component. This makes it easier to identify what might have broken and also can be used as a way of introducing more parallelism to our long running pipeline.
