org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.SimpleReadWriteTest failed, but is being worked on in CASSANDRA-15683
org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.CasWriteTest timed out, which looks like CASSANDRA-15676)

[~ifesdjeen] can you review the dtest changes?
[~blerer] [~e.dimitrova] can you review the Cassandra changes?

FYI the patch for 15650 broke ~150 tests.
https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/30/ 

The patches look fine to me.

for just the cassandra patchâ€¦

+1 for a Cassandra change. 

[~mck] if I understand the nature of the failure correctly, the main problem was merge. It was unintentional, and the patch itself was good, just based off earlier commit. 

I'll have to take a closer look at the dtest patch on Monday.

bq.  Michael Semb Wever if I understand the nature of the failure correctly, the main problem was merge.

That's my understanding too.

Since both you [~ifesdjeen] and [~blerer] have +1 on the main patch I've gone ahead and committed it.
