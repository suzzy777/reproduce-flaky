I see {{CommandExecutorTest.NoTransitionFromKillingToRunning}} failing often on Mac. According to the logs, the task is not transitioning to {{KILLED}} from {{KILLING}}. The reason is however unclear at first glance.
From a single `make check` session:
  * "good" run http://pastebin.com/88Ar34Lz
  * "bad" run http://pastebin.com/RKMmYV8z

I've seen both versions of the test (with HTTP and non-HTTP) command executor fail.
