Since JDK9 default encoding for .properties files (resource bundles) is UTF-8. JDK's ResourceBundle.getBundle().getString() automatically handles UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 files via PropertyResourceBundle.

But NbBundle methods always read resource bundles as ISO-8859-1. Many translation platforms around  produce UTF-8 files. Adapting the build process to add a transcoding step is not so easy and introduces new problems.

The NB platform code should be updated to have by default the same behavior as the current JDKs.

I'll try to come up with a patch...
