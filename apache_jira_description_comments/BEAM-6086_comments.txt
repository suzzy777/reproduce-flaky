From reading your code, the error message seems accurate. It is possible for the main input element to access the side input when the side input collection is empty. If you provide a default using {{withDefault()}} (in this case perhaps an empty map) then that value will be returned.

Is it possible to resolve this issue without providing a default value? Using a default in my use case is not acceptable. 

Hmm, upon consideration, it may be that the main input should wait for the side input to be ready.

I don't have bandwidth to look deeper into this right now - would you be interested?
