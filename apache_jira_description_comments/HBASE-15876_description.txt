HBASE-15875 purges the properly deprecated HTable. The method doBulkLoad(Path hfofDir, final HTable table), while it has a deprecated param, the method itself did not get a deprecation label; it is a public method in a public class marked stable. This issue is about getting consensus that it is ok to remove this method used by offline tooling that will break until updated on upgrade to 2.0 w/o a proper deprecation cycle (I think it will be ok to do this -- the benefit of our being able to remove HTable is worth this minor inconvenience). We'll do some ugly patching of this oversight by adding a late deprecation and flagging the removal of this offline method as an incompatible change in 2.0. We'll add the deprecation in a subissue.

It is a problem removing

  doBulkLoad(Path hfofDir, final HTable table) 

... since this is a public/stable Class.

There is the alternate:

  public void doBulkLoad(Path hfofDir, final Admin admin, Table table,
      RegionLocator regionLocator) throws TableNotFoundException, IOException  {

The former calls the latter.

The latter went in here:

    HBASE-12783 Create efficient RegionLocator implementation (Solomon Duskis)
{code}

This was added in time for release 1.1.0.

So, this method has not gone through a full major version of deprecation.

It will break when someone moves to 2.0. But it is offline method. Not the end of the world.
