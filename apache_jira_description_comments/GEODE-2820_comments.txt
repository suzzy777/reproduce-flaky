    GEODE-2820: Added awaitlity clause to wait for the region size to be …

    …correct
    
    	* Added awaitility clause to wait for all the regions to have all the entries
    	* This is done to make sure that the queries are executed.
    	* This may not solve the issue of queries being executed before async index is updated
    	* However this shortens the window of failure happening.

    Shouldn't this clause check the index size and not the region size?  I would think the timing issue was because the indexes were async.  Because of the async, the indexes may not have processes all of the updates prior to validating the contents of the index...

    @jhuynh1 Changed the validation  checks to verify that the size of the indexes are correct.
