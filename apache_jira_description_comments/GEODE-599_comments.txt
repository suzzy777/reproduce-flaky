This may be related to GEODE-566.

I think this is the same as GEODE-566.  I don't think this is a test issue - there is something wrong with the clear() method that's leaving an inconsistency.

Is GEODE-1046 the same as this bug? Bruce's comment suggests that this may be hitting a product bug rather than test issues. What would be a good label to differentiate possible product bugs?

This test also has async actions and thread sleeps.

Flaky: async actions, thread sleeps

    GEODE-599: CI Failure: DistributedAckPersistentRegionCCEDUnitTest.testClearWithConcurrentEventsAsync
    
    Cache modification lock was being released before operation distribution to other members.
    This provided a small window in which an operation from another thread could update the
    region prior to the other members receiving notification (i.e. down leveled)
