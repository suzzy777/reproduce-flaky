    @bbonnin Recently we have fixed some flaky test on master branch. Could you try rebase and see if CI becomes green?

    It looks better now, all is green !

    Works well as described.
    
    - tested on elasticsearch 2.4.4 (transport, http) and 5.0.0 (http only)
    - code looks nice. well abstracted client classes is shipped with some tests.
    
    there some commented code lines. LGTM except that.

    CI failure looks unrelated, since it only removed commented-out code from last CI success.
    Thanks @bbonnin for great contribution.
    LGTM and merge to master if no further discussions!

Thanks [~bbonnin]!
I see Fix Version is 0.8.0, but I see 0.7.0 is not out yet.  Is there any chance this feature will be in 0.7?


Since [0.7.0 branch cut|https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d2ac70a86e47b3a4cf48ef3c17c65fa982868d2bcb93c28778d29a92@%3Cdev.zeppelin.apache.org%3E], 0.7.0 branch receives only bug fixes to stabilize release.

However, I think changes made by this issue are isolated inside of elasticsearch interpreter submodule.
[~Mina Lee] What do you think?

Considering Zeppelin release cycle, if we don't include this improvement in 0.7.0 release, it will take up to 1 year for user to use this feature. And as moon said it will affect only elasticsearch module and if there is bug we can fix it and provide maintenance release so I am merging it into branch-0.7.

    Why is this not merged into apache:master?

    @jaspinderdineout This was merged into master.
