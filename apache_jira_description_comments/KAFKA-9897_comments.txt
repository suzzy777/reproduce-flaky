[~NaviBrar] – would you be interested to look into this one? You should have some context about the test. Would be nice if we could find and fix the root cause of the flakiness.

[~guozhang] recently improved the integration tests to add retries on seeing InvalidStateStoreException. Seems like this hasn't been failing since so maybe we can close this out?

I'd say "yes" (biased of course :)

Sure. We can always reopen again if necessary. What what the PR / Jira ticket number?

Failed again:

[~mjsax] that last failure is for a different test that was added recently, we merged a fix three days ago which I think was just after that build was triggered...but if you see that specific test fail again on a recent build can you reopen KAFKA-13128 instead?

Works for me.

[~ableegoldman] which fix were you referring to, could you point me to it? I saw this test failure locally but maybe my branch does not contain that fix yet.
