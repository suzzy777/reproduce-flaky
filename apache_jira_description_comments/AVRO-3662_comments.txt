CI is to fix
But, Avro is currently implemented in 10 languages, this leads to some issue :
 * For a new feature, it's difficult to add it everywhere.
 * Difficult to ensure that each implementation have same possibilities.
 * Bug fix can be hard ([This JIRA|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-3591] try to solve by adding common test system). 

On the other hand, it can be hard to decide which implementation to remove; and each developer & user -would- will have different advice (_Mine would be to remove perl, php and ruby_). 
May be a doodle would be a solution (for each language, get pro & cons; and remove an implementation when there are more than 80% cons)
