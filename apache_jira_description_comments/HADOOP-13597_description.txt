The Tomcat 6 we are using will reach EOL at the end of 2017. While there are other good options, I would propose switching to {{Jetty 9}} for the following reasons:
* Easier migration. Both Tomcat and Jetty are based on {{Servlet Containers}}, so we don't have change client code that much. It would require more work to switch to {{JAX-RS}}.
* Well established.
* Good performance and scalability.

Other alternatives:
* Jersey + Grizzly
* Tomcat 8

Your opinions will be greatly appreciated.
