Tagged branch-2 with 2.0.0-beta-1-RC0. Trying to figure the cryptic failure over in HBASE-19663.


Still struggling with HBASE-19663. Committed HBASE-19670 which removes doclet filtering of User API based off yetus annotations (User API will be bloated -- to fix subsequently). Master does not seem to have this problem. Running git bisects in meantime but fragile and take forever.

Made new tag 2.0.0-beta-1-RC0.2 which incorporates the HBASE-19670 workaround. Its at a46d4114b105b91cd5f2c5e3550b5238e4becc6e which includes the two more legit beta-1 commits since last night:

    HBASE-19428 Deprecate the compareTo(Row)

Pushed first RC with 'known issue' HBASE-19663 and HBASE-19670 workaround.

The first RC was tagged 2.0.0-beta-1-RC0.2 (the first attempt, 2.0.0-beta-1-RC0, failed).

The first RC VOTE [1] FAILED because of broke unit test HBASE-19666 (betas should pass unit test).

Making new RC with tag 2.0.0-beta-1-RC1.

Having trouble making new RC. Build fails: HBASE-19725. Up on dev list, the flakies are back to burn us. Looking at the these...

Put up an RC1 (second RC). Was shot down because of HBASE-19742.

Disabling the problematic test, fixing some flakies, and startup sequence which causes my startup on cluster to fail frequently... then putting up new RC tonight.

Builds hang here:

... for EVER.... 

I think hanging builds are bad machine. Building local again. Takes forever but succeeds. No hang.

Put up RC2 this morning but then realized (Appy posted dashboard for branch-2 and I ran a GCE build over night which showed failing tests) how many tests failed so squashed it.

Put up RC3 just now after fixing a load of tests.

Build takes two and a half hours (seems way longer). Used dev-support/make_rc.sh. If anything is off, e.g. machine reboots because it OOMEs, have to start over. Here is where time is spent:

05:00 min clean, ratcheck...
12:00 min building and downloading dependencies
54 min archetype bullshit?
48:21 min uploading to mvn repo







Resolving. beta-1 was pushed yesterday.
