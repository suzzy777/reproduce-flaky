    IGNITE-8987 Ignite hangs during getting of atomic structure after autoactivation

----


Fixed a hang on waiting of initialization after autoactivation.

Looks good to me!

The workflow is still not clear to me (why will this latch need to be reset) so I suggest [~dpavlov] to chime in, take a look and merge hopefully.

[~ilyak] , thank you for the review.

[~dpavlov] , could you please review the PR [https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/4664] ?

TC results: [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewQueued.html?itemId=1785623]

Restarted tests:
 * PDS (Direct IO) 2 [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1789396]
 * Run :: .NET [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewQueued.html?itemId=1789404]

 All failed tests seem flaky.

Thanks.

[~guseinov], the RunAll build was cancelled, so we cannot analyze the TC results in MTCGA utility. I've re-triggered run all, will get back to you shortly.

[~guseinov], can you please describe the race that you've fixed? I am not sure that latch re-creation itself does not add another race.

Got it, the latch was re-created by the activation process and await was done on a wrong latch.
Looks good, merging to master.
