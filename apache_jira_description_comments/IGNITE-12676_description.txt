Add partition-based AffinityCall and AffinityRun overloads to ICompute.See corresponding methods in Java (IgniteCompute).

Additionally, current affinity methods work through PlatformAbstractTask, which does not lock partitions. We should refactor existing AffinityCall and AffinityRun overloads to call corresponding IgniteCompute APIs.
