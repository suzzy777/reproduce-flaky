It seems CASSANDRA-17455 fixed only 4.0 and we need to extend the timing mentioned for 4.1 and trunk as the tests still occasionally fail there

Actually it seems it was never reported to be failing on 4.0 in the previous ticket but I guess [~Bereng] tested locally and figured it might be flaky there too, even if we haven't had records from Jenkins.

I will play with all branches to test. 

I do not think that only the duration is playing a role in these failures. 

No matter what a number I set the test is flaky in both 4.0 and 4.1. I got suspicious and went back to 4.0 rc2 and it is still flaky there. I wouldn't be surprised if it was introduced flaky in alpha1 but I didn't manage to build locally from that commit as too many changes happened to our builds since then and spending too much time on that didn't seem worth it to me.

In other words - this seems as a long time flaky test, no regression or 4.1 blocker. We should look into it but it is not a priority for the 4.1 release. Removing from the blockers list and will get back to it later. 

Hi [~e.dimitrova]. Timeouts were raised originally in 4.1 and trunk as well if I am not missing anything. I managed to repro locally and raised timeouts accordingly. If it's still failing then I agree there's more to it but not a blocker as you say +1

I am not sure I will have time for this one any time soon so I am unassigning it in case someone gets to it before me. 

Just hit it with a PR for trunk: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/instaclustr/cassandra/2993/workflows/b3716506-2997-4b80-815d-16ed3e380acb/jobs/105508/tests

Yeah I see it every now and then. It needs more digging imo as Ekaterina said...
