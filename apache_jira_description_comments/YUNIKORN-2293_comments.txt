Good catch [~Yu-Lin Chen]. In fact, I suggest dropping the entire "log-to-the-console" approach. Instead, we should use the [upload-artifact|https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact?tab=readme-ov-file] Github action. We can file a separate Jira for it.

[~Yu-Lin Chen] Could you please file an umbrella issue to include all e2e-related issues? As [~pbacsko] mentioned, you have the great finding, and we need "some" PRs to stabilize e2e tests. Hence, it would be great to have a entry point for reader to follow your thoughts :)

[~pbacsko] Agree to use upload-artifact. The current console log is a bit messy, let me conduct some invetigation first, and will create a separate Jira for it.

[~chia7712] Sure, I will create an umbrella issue to track recently discovered e2e-related issues.

Merged to master.
