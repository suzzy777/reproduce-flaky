    [ZEPPELIN-3022] The "Default Interpreter" select box on the "Create new note" modal dialog has no contents when it is opened via the "Create new note" link on ${ZEPPELIN_HOME}/webapps/webapp/app/home/notebook.html

    The "Default Interpreter" select box on the "Create new note" modal dialog has no contents when it is opened via the "Create new note" link on $
    {ZEPPELIN_HOME}/webapps/webapp/app/home/notebook.html.
    
    Fix $
    {ZEPPELIN_HOME}/webapps/webapp/app/home/notebook.html so that NoteCreateCtrl.getInterpreterSettings() is invoked when the "Create new note" link is clicked.

    Thanks @kjmrknsn for the fix!
    
    CI job 7.3 and 7.4 failed and looks like it's flaky test. https://travis-ci.org/kjmrknsn/zeppelin/builds/295636412
    
    Could you try re-run failed tests and see if they goes green?
