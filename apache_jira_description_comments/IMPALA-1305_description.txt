In this case, e.g. group by distinct_col, the current behavior is bad, especially if this causes spilling.

In both the spilling and not spilling case, the local agg does nothing and takes a lot of time. The rows are then passed to the merge agg which does all the useful work.

In the case of spilling, as the local agg starts returning rows (partitions that were not spilled), the merge agg starts accumulating memory. This leaves less for the local agg (they share they same memory limit), meaning the local agg has to spill more. This continues to get worse as the local agg returns more rows and more memory is accumulated in the merge agg. 

We should probably fix this in general by realizing when the reduction ratio is bad enough in the local agg, and then having it just skip the aggregation step. It would simply transform the input rows to intermediate rows, which would be streaming.
