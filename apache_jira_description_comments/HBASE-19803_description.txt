It reports two hangs for TestAsyncTableGetMultiThreaded, but I checked the surefire output

https://builds.apache.org/job/HBASE-Flaky-Tests/24830/artifact/hbase-server/target/surefire-reports/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestAsyncTableGetMultiThreaded-output.txt

This one was likely to be killed in the middle of the run within 20 seconds.

This one was also killed within about 1 minutes.

The test is declared as LargeTests so the time limit should be 10 minutes. It seems that the jvm may crash during the mvn test run and then we will kill all the running tests and then we may mark some of them as hang which leads to the false positive.
