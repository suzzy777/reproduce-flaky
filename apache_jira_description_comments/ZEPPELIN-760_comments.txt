    I was getting test errors earlier because I copy/pasted to fast and didn't change the name of the interpreter context variable as I went (or changed it to the wrong thing). 
    
    I looked through the test profile and can't find the specified error.  If I have missed it could you please reference a line number in the build logs.

    That seems flaky test. Could you re-trigger CI once? close-open pullrequest or adding a commit will trigger CI.

    I ran tests on my machine my test stopped 
    
    ```
    Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5.267 sec - in org.apache.zeppelin.ignite.IgniteSqlInterpreterTest
    
    Results :
    
    Failed tests: 
      IgniteInterpreterTest.testInterpret:102 null
    
    Tests run: 7, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
    ```
    
    `IgniteInterpreterTest.testInterpret` seems okay itself.
    But when it runs after other tests in `IgniteInterpreterTest`, [`result.message()` at line 102](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/794/files#diff-3f8aa43c71703e591afbf0f0bb9174fdR102) returns result of previous test and it fails. This is strange. @rawkintrevo Do you have any idea on this behavior?

    I really don't.  I don't know much of anything about Ignite.  I really was only doing this for Flink, but Felix asked that I apply the fix to Scalding/Ignite as well since the fix was essentially the same.  While the code for the interpreters are essentially the same, there is a lot more variance in the structure and syntax of the testing files which has been causing all of these issues. 
    
    As I read the code, its just asking how many clusters and nodes exist?  Is there someone out there that knows Ignite that could weigh in?

    @rawkintrevo  Please feel free to confine this change if it would help.
    We could follow up separately for Ignite.

    I moved the test to the end on a hunch that max fix the build issue.  @Leemoonsoo can you run again on your machine? I think the code is solid- it just seems to be crashing on random spots in the CI build. When I build locally it crashes (consistently) in the Spark interpreter (even on fresh clone). 
    
    If this doesn't work- I'll just drop the Ignite support. Hate to do it bc I think the solution is sound its just bad tests :/

    After reviewing the other InterpreterTest files, I find that none utilize a test where the output '.contains' a specific string.  That specific test in Ignite is supposed to be testing for weather the interpreter is 'live' and can handle some basic commands which is verified by the assertion in the test.  While it _should_ compile and regularly does. It seems to be consistently failing on one specific configuration, which leads me to believe the failure has more to do with the configuration than anything else.  
    
    Personally I would recommend dropping the line:
    `assertTrue(result.message().contains(sizeVal + ": Int = " + ignite.cluster().nodes().size()));`
    which is the line of failure in the Hadoop 1.6.0 builds, e.g. the hangup.  The line preceding the proposed drop line asserts that the line is successfully executed.  E.g. `val " + sizeVal + " = ignite.cluster().nodes().size()` does successfully execute. The test that is causing failure is that what ever is returned by that line is not what one would expect. Again, ignite is the only interpreter to run this sort of test.  
    
    The ability to handle companion objects for all Ignite users seems more important than a possibly unexpected number of nodes reported in a very specific build of Hadoop. 
    
    Just my .02. 
    
    I have no problem resetting the Ignite files.
