[~mjsax] I've made a [PR|https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6505] related to KAFKA-8030 where I changed this test too. It might have fixed the problem. Do you see if any more tests failed since that change?

Since there were no reports of this test being flaky for a while now I'll close this JIRA. Please reopen it if the tests are still flaky.
