IMPALA-6560: fix regression test for IMPALA-2376

The test is modified to increase the size of collections allocated.
num_nodes and mt_dop query options are set to make execution as
deterministic as possible.

I looped the test overnight to try to flush out flakiness.

Adds support for row_regex lines in CATCH sections so that we can
match a larger part of the error message.
