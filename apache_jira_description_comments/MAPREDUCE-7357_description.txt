h2. What is the purpose of this change

This issue is to fix a non-idempotent test
{code:java}
org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.webapp.TestAppController.testAttempt{code}
h2. Why the test failed

The root cause for the failure is that this test does not remove the value of key AMParams.ATTEMPT_STATE, which pollutes the shared state. It may be better to clean state pollutions so that some other tests won't fail in the future due to the shared state polluted by this test.
h2. Reproduce test failure

Run the test twice in the same JVM.
h2. Expected result

The test should run successfully without any failures.
h2. Actual result

Failure from test run:
{code:java}
[ERROR] Failures:
[ERROR] TestAppController.testAttempts:315 expected:<[Bad request: missing attempt-state.]> but was:<[State MAP attempts in job_01_01]>{code}
h2. Fix 

Remove the {{AMParams.ATTEMPT_STATE}} key-value pair.
