Hello,

It appears some tests can be lost when using the parallel mode with parameterized tests. Here is a [small project|https://github.com/jderrien/surefire-junit-tests/tree/simple-1] I've used to try to reproduce the issue we have seen.

This is not something that happens on every run, but it's quite frequent.

With this loop, the problem should appear in less than 2 minutes, maybe on the first run when (un)lucky:
{code}
time while true; do mvn clean test > last.log ; tail -25 last.log ; if [ "$(grep -c 'Tests run: 12' last.log)" == "0" ]; then break; fi ; done
{code}

Normal run:
{noformat}

When tests have been lost (here one test lost according to the output):
{noformat}

Note: there are 3 test classes and 18 tests on the [master branch|https://github.com/jderrien/surefire-junit-tests/tree/master] and it's even more frequent/easy to reproduce.
