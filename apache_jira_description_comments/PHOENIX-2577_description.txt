We currently burn a commit when we do DDL and use the read pointer as our timestamp for our system catalog (so that we're reading at the same timestamp we're writing). We should be consistent about this and do the same for alter table. This will hopefully fix some test flakiness in the TransactionIT.testNoConflictDetectionForImmutableRows test.
