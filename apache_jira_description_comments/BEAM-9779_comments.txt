I've been able to run this test many times locally and unable to reproduce.

It blocks on a pipeline run that writes messages to HL7v2 store and then lists messages to verify count in = count out.

The failure pattern seems to be  that intermittently less messages than expected are written to the HL7v2 Store.


Seems that HL7v2 Store is indexed asynchronoulsy.
Will add a sleep for 5s to stabilize this test.

Working theory wasn't able to reproduce locally because I have higher latency to the HL7v2 store in us-central1 than the jenkins VMs. 

Can we please remove/sickbay flaky tests from general PostCommit test suite till we root cause the underlying issue for flakiness. I suggest adding a new test suite for HL7v2IO tests if the fix is to add a large timeout.

[~chamikara] Has the changes in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11450 stabilized this test? should we close this?

I think so. Test suite looks pretty stable now: [https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Beam/view/PostCommit/job/beam_PostCommit_Java/]

We can resolve this.
