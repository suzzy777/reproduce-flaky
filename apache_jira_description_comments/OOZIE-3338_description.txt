Oozie [documentation|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/docs/src/site/twiki/ENG_MiniOozie.twiki#L20-L26] still refers to the SVN server:
{noformat}
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/oozie/trunk
{noformat}
which is no longer available.

The current address is the following:
{noformat}
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/oozie/
{noformat}
It only contains a README file and forwards to the git server.

We should remove the SVN references from the file.

It would also be useful to simplify [mkdistro.sh|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/bin/mkdistro.sh] and remove the SVN support.
