Thanks for checking [~maedhroz], I'll take a look.

This test makes the following assertions to ensure snapshots of dropped tables are properly expired after a node restart when auto_snapshot_ttl=20s:
a) that a snapshot of a dropped table exists after a node restart
b) that the snapshot is gone after expiration (20s)

This test assumes that the restart will take less than auto_snapshot_ttl=20s. If a restart takes longer than that then the snapshot is cleared as soon as the node starts and the first assertion fails.

The trivial fix is to increase auto_snapshot_ttl=60s, in the hope that a restart will never take longer than a minute and the first assertion will never fail. Unfortunately this will make the test longer but a bit more deterministic.

I dropped a couple nits in the PR, but LGTM overall. I guess the difficulty here is that you can't strictly guess how long the restart will take, and therefore can't know when the first check on {{listsnapshots}} is irrelevant. The only alternative I could see is inspecting the stdout, pulling a timestamp of some kind from it, and ignoring the check on the drop prefix in the first assert if too much time had passed.

Thanks for the feedback. Addressed nit comments and resubmitted CI for 4.1/trunk:

[~maedhroz] are you happy with the latest changes?

+1

Here are some repeated runs of the fixed flaky test, still running:

The CircleCI config file for these runs has been generated with:

It seems that all the runs above have succeeded :)

Thanks for the test runs [~adelapena]. Would you mind committing this? Unfortunately I'm not able to commit this before a few days.

Sure, starting commit.
