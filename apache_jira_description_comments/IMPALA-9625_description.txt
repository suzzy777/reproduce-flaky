Impala's COMPUTE STATS statement results in the registration of the ALTER event twice. One is in {{Analyzer#registerAuthAndAuditEvent()}} at [https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/fe/src/main/java/org/apache/impala/analysis/Analyzer.java#L3131-L3133] and the other is in {{Analyzer#getTable()}} at [https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/fe/src/main/java/org/apache/impala/analysis/Analyzer.java#L2862-L2863].

In {{registerAuthAndAuditEvent()}}, the corresponding full table name {{table.getFullName()}} is produced by a call to {{Analyzer#resolveTableRef()}} ([https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/fe/src/main/java/org/apache/impala/analysis/ComputeStatsStmt.java#L352]). The resulting database and table names are both in lowercase.

However, in {{getTable()}}, the fully-qualified table name is produce by a call to {{Analyzer#getFqTableName()}} at [https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/fe/src/main/java/org/apache/impala/analysis/Analyzer.java#L2836]. The resulting database and table names are in their originally unconverted form provided by the user from the Impala shell. Hence, there is no guarantee that the database and table names are both in lowercase.

Therefore, if a user does not provide lowercase database and table names, the returned full table name from {{registerAuthAndAuditEvent()}} and {{getTable()}} would differ, resulting in duplicate ALTER events for the same table.

We should at least make the full table name consistent every time when we register such an audit event to avoid duplicate entries in the log.
