CASSANDRA-15740 added the ability to stream entire sstable by loading on-disk file into user-space off-heap buffer when SSL is enabled, because netty doesn't support zero-copy with SSL.

But there are two issues:
 # file channel is not closed.
 # 1mb batch size is used. 1mb exceeds buffer pool's max allocation size, thus it's all allocated outside the pool and will cause large amount of allocations.

[Patch|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/651]:
 # close file channel when the last batch is loaded into off-heap bytebuffer. I don't think we need to wait until buffer is flushed by netty.
 # reduce the batch to 64kb which is more buffer pool friendly when streaming entire sstable with SSL.
