Removed Fix Version 2.2.1 as this issue is not blocking that release.

Since this is not a blocker issue, as part of the 2.6.0 release process I'm changing the fix version to `2.6.1` and `2.7.0`. If this is incorrect, please respond and discuss on the "[DISCUSS] Apache Kafka 2.6.0 release" discussion mailing list thread.

Since this is not a blocker, there is no active PR  I'm clearing the "fix version" field as part of the 2.7.0 release process.

We didn't put the latest failed error stack trace, which is not easy to investigate. Maybe we can re-enable it and gather the failed message when occurrence?

+1 on re-enabling. I ran this over 20k iterations, couldn't reproduce.

This test is currently getting skipped. Moving this issue to the next release (3.4.0).

The test is currently disabled and the ticket is unassigned so moving to the next release.

Moving it to 3.7.0 as we are near code freeze and it is not assigned.

Changing target fix version to 3.8 since this is not a blocker and we are cutting a 3.7 RC
