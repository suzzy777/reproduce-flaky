This seems still to be broken. See https://scans.gradle.com/s/37dapyjlibxnq/console-log?task=:beam-website:testWebsite or https://scans.gradle.com/s/52bux7l5lwjky/console-log?task=:beam-website:testWebsite

We could reduce the concurrency further, or increase the timeout?

Honestly, I did not follow the discussion on mailing list regarding this. And unfortunately do not have an understanding, what's the root case to this issue. Is it jira preventing some DOS attacks and therefore slowing down responses? Or is jira just overloaded? Or something completely different?


Test is no longer failing consistently.
