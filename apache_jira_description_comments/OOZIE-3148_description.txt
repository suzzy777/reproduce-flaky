OOZIE-2817 introduced rerunning of failing test cases in pre-commit builds (changed {{bin/test-patch-20-tests}} Bash script).  
It is no longer necessary as OOZIE-3106 upgraded surefire-plugin to 2.20.1 and since of 2.19.1 version of the maven surefire plugin it is allowed rerunning failing tests via {{-Dsurefire.rerunFailingTestsCount=2}} (see http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/rerun-failing-tests.html). For example, a test passed in its second run will output on the screen:
{code}

  Run 1: ...
  Run 2: PASS
Then this test will be counted as a flaky test. The build will be successful, but in the end of the summary of all tests run, the number of flaky tests will be output on the screen, for example:

  Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Flakes: 1
{code}

We could introduce this mechanism and update {{bin/test-patch-20-tests}}.
