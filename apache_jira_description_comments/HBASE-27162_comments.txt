[~apurtell] FYI.

Run the tests 100 times locally, can not reproduce the problem...

Will try to reproduce it.

I have not been able to reproduce this so far after 25 iterations, under a variety of different competing CPU loads. Waiting until 100 before I call it. In the meantime I will open a subtask to post a small performance improvement (compression ratio) that came about while inspecting the code.

After 100 iterations of {{mvn clean install -DskipITs -Dtest=Test*ValueCompress*}}, cannot reproduce

https://nightlies.apache.org/hbase/HBase-Flaky-Tests/master/3847/hbase-server/target/surefire-reports/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.regionserver.TestReplicationValueCompressedWAL-output.txt

But we keep seeing this on the flaky dashboard...

Starange...

Ok.

Converted this issue to a flaky test issue.

Would you like me to submit a PR to @Ignore this test for now? To clean up the nightlies? I do not have enough to go on right now to understand the problem. Can come back to this later and try to de-flake it.
