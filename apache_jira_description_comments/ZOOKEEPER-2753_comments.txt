    @hanm thanks for this! I pulled the code into a specialized branch on which I hope to land all of our jenkins related tooling:
    
    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/tree/jenkins-tools
    
    I also changed the script around a bit to use out testReport from the jobs to identify failed tests. If folks have suggestions they can now use this to submit PRs in a similar way as the rest of our codebase
    
    Please take a look and if you are ok with the current status please close this.
    
    ps. I've also updated the jenkins job to reflect:
