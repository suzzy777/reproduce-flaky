Changed the order of the null test to be sane.

Did not change the results as this is not internal, therefore creating a broader discussion.

Created the missing unit test for this class.

    Add FlakyTest category to tests with open bugs
    
    Annotate test methods with FlakyTest category if there is an open
    bug for that test. This will improve the signal/noise ratio for
    unit/integration/distributed tests.  Flaky tests are still run
    as part of precheckin and flakyTest targets.
