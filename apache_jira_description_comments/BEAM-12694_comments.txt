[~emilymye] are you the right owner for this, if not can you see if the [~jiahaowu] should be fixing it?

In looking at the issue, the DICOM Store ID is being generated using a random string generator and the HTTP 409 error that is generated should be a very rare occurrence, but this won't impact the actual IO Connector and is really related to the Integration Test.

The issue is that the store id that was generated for the test already existed in that project, region, dataset combination. Should be improbable for happening regularly, hence I think the tag Flaky is appropriate. I believe this can be fixed by appending a timestamp after the randomly generated string to eliminate the possibility of a duplicate generated store id.

I will begin working on a fix today(08/17/2021)

Is there a rollback that would restore testing signal while we fix this? Or if it is a flake would it possibly be P1? How much is this blocking people from working?

This cannot be addressed with a rollback. It is not related to a new change. Based on the problem description it should be a rare flake, and could be a P1. [~dranderson@google.com] is working to fix this before the 2.33.0 cut date.

This is a common flake that is still happening.

[~dranderson@google.com] are you still working on this?

I believe this test is flakey for release 2.33.0. I'll increment the fix version

The test was much flakier than you would expect if the problem was truly random collisions. Random collisions of 15-character-length random strings using lowercase, uppercase, and digits are extremely unlikely – there are 62^15 possible strings. And I saw the same collision occur in two separate test runs (on DICOM_store_WRmhFzqnPc8ZnNj). So maybe the problem was the random seeding.

Regardless, I believe [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15697] should fix the issue. Please reopen if you see this flake occur again.

I saw another collision with DICOM_store_WRmhFzqnPc8ZnNj on the 2.34.0 release branch. Either I'm bad at math, or this is incredibly unlikely to happen if the string was truly random. https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Python37_PR/299/testReport/apache_beam.io.gcp.dicomio_integration_test/DICOMIoIntegrationTest/test_dicom_search_instances/
