When ZKFC binds its RPC server to a hostname for listening, it uses the host value specified by dfs.namenode.rpc-address. It should instead use dfs.namenode.rpc-bind-host if that value has been set. If the value has not been set, then it can fall back on  dfs.namenode.rpc-address as it currently does.
