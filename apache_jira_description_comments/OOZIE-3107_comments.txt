[~dbist13] very minor: could you pls remove the unnecessary tab character from the patch? Just to make everyone happy.

[~pbacsko] please review, also, found many tabs in main pom, perhaps tackle those in a separate jira?

Thanks [~dbist13], committed this to master.

Closing issue; Oozie 5.0.0-beta1 is released
