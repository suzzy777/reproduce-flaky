IMPALA-10397 : Reduce flakiness in test_single_workload

This test failed recently due to a timeout waiting for executors to
come up. The logs showed that the executors came up on time but it
was not recognized by the coordinator. This patch attempts to reduce
flakiness by increasing the timeout and adding more logging in case
this happens in the future.

Testing:
Ran in a loop on my local for a few hours.

Happened again in some of the release builds

Looked at the logs and it seems like the autoscaler never stated up a new cluster. The autoscaler checks for queued queries every 1 sec, so this can only happens if it never notices queries queue. Since this is happening on release builds I think the queries are fast enough to finish early and never get queued. Increasing the runtime for them should be able to fix this issue

IMPALA-10397: Fix test_single_workload

The logs on failed runs indicated that the autoscaler never started
another cluster. This can only happen if it never notices a queued
query which is possible since this test was only failing in release
builds. This patch increases the runtime of the sample query to
make execution more predictable.

Testing:
Looped on my local on a release build

Saw a failure after the change:
{code:java}
custom_cluster/test_auto_scaling.py:124: in test_single_workload
    assert max_query_rate > single_group_query_rate, "Query rate did not exceed %s " \
E   AssertionError: Query rate did not exceed 1.6 within 60 s. Maximum was 1.6. Cluster size is 5.
E   assert 1.6 > 1.6{code}
[~bikramjeet.vig] Should we track this in this Jira as well? It's still in a downstream exhaustive release build.

This definitely seems like an outcome of my previous change. That part of the test that relies on query rate has been historically flaky, I think we can just get rid of it since we are already verifying that the cluster grew before this (which is what the test is meant to check). I'll remove the flaky part in my next patch.

IMPALA-10397: De-flake test_single_workload

This patch removes a flaky part of the test that relies on query
completion rate. Since we are already verifying that number of
healthy executor groups increases, this additional check is not
adding much to the test.
