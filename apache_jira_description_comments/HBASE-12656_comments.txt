bq.  I fear if Visibility delete is broken some where

If this is *not* a test only problem we can make this a blocker...

No problem with the functionality.  When there are two deletes that happens with the same ts because of the environment for cases where we verify deletes with no specific ts this happens. So lowering the priority.

Moving out of 0.98.9


No activity. Unscheduling. If this is a problem in a specific branch or release we can schedule work on a fix for it.

Is it related to HBASE-18572?

Resolving as no longer valid. Probably as per [~chia7712], fixed elsewhere. The test now passes. See https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-2/415/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.visibility/TestVisibilityLabelsWithDeletes/
