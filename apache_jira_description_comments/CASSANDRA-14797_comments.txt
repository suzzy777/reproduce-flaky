Patch forthcoming (as soon as I suss out the state-of-the-art for this)

Convention for posting patches/branches/tests notwithstanding...

Interestingly, I also started going down this path back in 2018 and ended up dropping the work, but need to pick it up now. I'll have a patch  against current trunk that includes my previous work + Eric's patch (Thanks Eric, if you're still paying attention here!) within the next few business days.

PR in https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1461 against trunk to get Circle running.

Added a patch with just the code changes and not circle config just in case... there are 2 commits on the PR branch to keep them separate as well.

Looks good to me. I haven't been able to get a clean CI run yet, but that looks to be down to unrelated issues. I'll keep on at that, but in the meantime this could use a second reviewer.

CI issues were mostly attributable to CASSANDRA-17351/CASSANDRA-15234. A fix is in flight for those, and with the workaround applied CI looks good, with only a handful of known flaky tests failing:

+1 on the patch

I've added the rebased/updated patch after addressing issues raised on the PR (https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13041281/cassandra-14797-update1.diff)
