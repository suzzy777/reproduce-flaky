The {{UriDiskProfileTest.FetchFromHTTP}} test is flaky on Debian 9:
{noformat}
../../src/tests/disk_profile_tests.cpp:683
Failed to wait 15secs for future
{noformat}

I also run it in repetition and got the following error log (although the test itself is passed):
{noformat}
E0209 18:26:37.030012  7282 uri_disk_profile.cpp:220] Failed to parse result: Failed to parse DiskProfileMapping message: INVALID_ARGUMENT:Unexpected end of string. Expected a value.
