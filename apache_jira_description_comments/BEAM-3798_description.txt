Performance tests are flaky due to transient errors that happened during data processing (eg. SocketTimeoutException while connecting to DB). Currently exceptions that happen on Dataflow runner but are retried successfully, fail the test regardless of the final job state (giving a false-negative result). 

Possible solution for batch scenarios:
We could "rethrow" exceptions that happened due to transient errors *only* if the job status is other than DONE.

Possible solution for streaming scenarios:
