There is a JIRA ticket on upstream that brought this usability improvement in Hive to support auto type widening for Parquet tables. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12080
This improvement is very useful for users who have schema evolution on their tables. For example, a Hive table with a "bigint" can read parquet files with "int32" and "int64" types.
The patch only supports widening conversions from int->bigint and float->double. We should support more types to allow users read their changed parquet schema.
Here's a list of widening conversions we should support:
{code}
tinyint     ->  smallint,int,bigint,float,double
smallint  -> int,bigint,float,double
int          -> bigint,float,double
bigint     -> float,double
float       ->  double
double   ->  --
{code}
