that escaped my attention when I looked for thing marked for 1.3. This test is definitely flaky now on 1.3. will look tomorrow.

Looking at here HBASE-16089, https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12813161/HBASE-16089.v3.patch

I don't understand some thing, why did we change this from 5ms to 100ms?

public static final int CALL_QUEUE_CODEL_DEFAULT_TARGET_DELAY = 100;

Need to take another look at this patch tomorrow

Also thread prefix name is incorrect yes. With corrected named (below) the tests seem to be passing reliable for me. will run more in the loop to check

envEdge.threadNamePrefixs.add("RpcServer.CodelFPBQ.default.handler");
envEdge.threadNamePrefixs.add("RpcServer.CodelRWQ.default.handler");

[~stack] with the above changes to handler names in the test it's fast and stable for me (ran 50 times in a loop and all passed). Going to commit in master, branch-1 and branch-1.3. Do you want to enable it in master now?

a trivial patch (changing test only) that I committed

marking resolved, and filed a separate jira to re-enable it on master
