LinuxFilesystemIsolatorTest.ROOT_ImageInVolumeWithRootFilesystem sometimes fails on CentOS 7 with this kind of output:
{noformat}
../../src/tests/containerizer/filesystem_isolator_tests.cpp:1054: Failure
Failed to wait 2mins for launch
{noformat}

LinuxFilesystemIsolatorTest.ROOT_MultipleContainers often has this output:
{noformat}
../../src/tests/containerizer/filesystem_isolator_tests.cpp:1138: Failure
Failed to wait 1mins for launch1
{noformat}

Whether SSL is configured makes no difference.

This test may also fail on other platforms, but more rarely.
