Follow up to HBASE-19756 which dealt with NPEs during proc cleanup. Unfortunately, the patch for branch-1 might not remove some valid procs too. The branch-2 patch doesn't have this problem. This fixes the branch-1 bug and also adds another test to branch-2. Thanks to [~toffer] for flagging this internally.
