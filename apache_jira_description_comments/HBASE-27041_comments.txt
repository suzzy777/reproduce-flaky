I've already deleted the broken output for two find flaky tests, so it should be OK for now.

The state of the flaky tests job for branch-2 is not good. The problem is TestClusterScopeQuotaThrottle, it will hang there forever and cause the build to timeout.

Let me upload the jstack result of the hanging process. Need to dig more.

This broken test name is really generated by maven,

{noformat}
...
[INFO] Running org.apache.hadoop.hbase.http.TestSpnegoHttpServer
[INFO] Running org.apache.hadoop.hbase.htWtApR.NTIeNsGt:H tAtnp Sielrlveegra
...
{noformat}

https://ci-hbase.apache.org/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-2/541/artifact/output-jdk11-hadoop3/patch-unit-root.txt/*view*/

Ah, then let's delete this build and try again...

Okay. I deleted branch-2/541 and re-ran the flakies job. This garbage string is no longer in the excludes file.
