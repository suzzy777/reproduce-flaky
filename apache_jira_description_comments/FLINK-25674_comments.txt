[~echauchot], there seems to be another Cassandra test failure :-(

ouch, bad news ! [~trohrmann] thanks for pointing out! Pausing my work on [FLINK-23843|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-23843] and taking a look 

[~trohrmann] can you share the link of the stacktrace ?

I found the stacktrace, don't bother

I've updated the description to contain the link.

[~trohrmann] I think we should consider all pojo tests together: _testCassandraBatchPojoFormat_, _testCassandraPojoAtLeastOnceSink_ and _testCassandraPojoNoAnnotatedKeyspaceAtLeastOnceSink_ because the _AlreadyExistsException: Table _ happens only on them. These tests use different table names and the whole keyspace is dropped at the begining of the testCase. So it could be either:
1- a race condition between instances of the same test method. Is this even possible considering that we create a test container as a ClassRule ? tests should not share a test container.
2- retrial: if the test fails with NoHostAvailableExeception after the table creation and the test is retried, the table still exists and the whole test is relaunched along with the table creation leading to the exception. I'm wondering why we don't see the log.warn message but, as the rule restarts the test, maybe it is a different log file in azure
=> I'd go for 2. I guess we should allow some house cleaning in the retrial rule. I propose we allow the retry rule to receive a callback that is called in case of error. WDYT ?


Hmm, could we verify that 2 indeed is possible (the logging part going amiss)? Maybe we could let it fail manually and then see whether the log statements appear or not. Just to be sure that this is indeed this case.

In general, I think it makes sense that other rules run their {{after}} method before the test is restarted.

[~trohrmann] I opened [FLINK-25690|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-25690] to track number 2

[~trohrmann] our comments interleaved. Ok I'll confirm for the log.

[~trohrmann] _NoHostAvailableException_ can indeed be thrown in the tests methods after a table was created. I'll migrate to _RetryExtension_  as [~chesnay] suggested in [FLINK-25690|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-25690] and do several tests: simple retrials and retrials after table creation and try to reproduce the flakiness.

[~trohrmann]
Done: 
Migrated CassandraITCase to RetryExtension 
- tested it by manually throwing 2 NoHostHavailableException => retrial mechanism works perfectly (I got the logs) !
- tested it by throwing NoHostHavailableException after a table creation and I managed to reproduce the "table already exist exception"
=> that confirms my diagnostic. I will now add the after methods to the test to drop the tables before retrials

thanks [~chesnay] for backporting to 1.14

Thanks [~chesnay] for backporting to 1.13

Reopening because all cassandra pojo tests suffer from table already exists problem that should be resolved by introducing dynamic table names in [this PR|https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/18544]
