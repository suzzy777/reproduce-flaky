On local build, we see intermittent failures in the following test classes:
 # RateControlledFileSystemTest
 # HiveSourceTest
 # HighLevelConsumerTest

The test failures happen due to a combination of reasons:
 # Failure to clean up files/directories (HiveSourceTest)
 # Inadequate number of iterations resulting in sample mean not converging (RateControlledFileSystemTest), and
 # Timeout exceptions (HighLevelConsumerTest)

This task attempts to fix the flakiness in these test classes.
