TestHBaseFsck#testCheckTableLocks changes the "hbase.table.lock.expire.ms" config from 10 minutes default value to 1 ms.  This change impacts other tests in the TestHBaseFsck test suite, especially in branch-1.1.  

{code}
conf.setLong(TableLockManager.TABLE_LOCK_EXPIRE_TIMEOUT, 1);
{code}

The proposed change is to make the configuration change local for testing purpose so that other tests would not be impacted.
