[~data-runner0] Would you mind take a look at the test failures? It seems at least one variant of the healthcare IO integration tests would fail each time.

Assigning to [~lastomato] since Jacob no longer spends time on FhirIO.

This could have been caused by quota limit in apache-beam-testing project.

Is this still currently failing? If not, you can remove that label. I have labeled it "flake" and kept at P1 which is our policy for flakes.

Looks like FhirIO_Import test is failing again.

[~yichi] Can you please take a look and assign it to the right owner?

I've created a request to bump up the quota limit.
