Test to verify the fix. Right now it is flaky (which demonstrates the bug).

Present in 0.94 also i think.

Thanks for reporting this issue. It is a test problem.  I will fix the test case you uploaded.

Can you elaborate?

After the table is re-enabled, the region could be assigned to a different region server.  However, the HBase client caches the old connection, that's why the NotServingRegion exception.  Once you add a line to clear the region cache, then it should work as expected:

original.getConnection().clearRegionCache();

I was thinking how should the HBase client to deal with such scenario better.

Good call. I tried your fix and it stopped the flakiness, with 40 consecutive successful runs. 

Perhaps we should clear the region cache automatically after a table is enabled or disabled?

Yes Jimmy.  This is what i observed yesterday. It should be done automatically i suppose. 

Close this issue as Not A Problem.  Filed a new issue HBASE-7144 on the retry issue.  Will re-use the same test on HBASE-7144, without clean the region cache.

@Ram, yes, it should be done automatically.  I will look into it in HBASE-7144.

@Aleks, thanks for verifying the test.  We will use the same test in HBASE-7144, without region cache clean.

No problem. Thanks everyone for looking into this issue thoroughly.
