ZOOKEEPER-1416 will add support for Persistent Recursive Watchers. This feature allows Curator to re-think/re-write the various cache recipes so that they're simpler, use less resources and more stable.

* Change Curator to depend on ZooKeeper 3.6.x
* Add a new module so that backward compatibility with 3.5 is ensured
* Add new methods corresponding to {{ZooKeeper.addWatch()}}
* Add a new recipe that enables a fully managed Persistent watch
* Create new Cache recipes that use the new Persistent watch recipe
* Replace internal usages of TreeCache/PathChildrenCache/NodeCache with new cache recipe
* Deprecate TreeCache/PathChildrenCache/NodeCache
* Updated docs/tests/etc
