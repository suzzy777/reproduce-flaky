The following tests are too flaky for reliable inclusion in CI tests or testing in general. As they still seem to work sometimes, the general feature obviously works, so I'm disabling these tests and leaving this issue behind for further investigation.

Whatever is done to fix this should ensure that the test works in a CI environment. These flakes eat up a huge amount of time when trying to run all the tests which encourages people to stop doing that, thus leading to real CI failures.
