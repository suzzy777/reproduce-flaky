I'll post a workaround that I think should work for now to better avoid this specific cause of this issue (which is likely to be extremely common), but we should also rework the master initialization code to be more crash tolerant on first run.

FYI the workaround I mention was committed back in September as 7ce36ed83908a6c3e05e683332f1c3fb205cfac3

It doesn't fix the issue, just makes it less likely at first-run since it specifically checks for the NTP issue before writing anything.

I'm having exactly the same issue after a crash. I'm using kudu 0.8.0 revision 7874185b07198267229c1cc921b21549ea16cf53 with CDH 5.7. 

[~hakanilter]: Can you upload or send me the master logs please? Ideally before and after the crash. If you don't want to upload the logs to this JIRA then please gzip and email them to me. 

Thanks,
Mike

If that directory is empty, it fails to start. I remove that empty directory and it should work.

The work around is removing related folders:
e.g.
rm -rf /data/1/kudu-master
rm -rf /data/2/kudu-master
rm -rf /var/lib/kudu/master


and then restart kudu service from Cloudera manager.


ThatÂ works

Note that this causes some tests to be flaky, namely, those that kill a master before using the client to do some operation that leads to ConnectToCluster (which I think effectively blocks until all catalog managers are initialized).
