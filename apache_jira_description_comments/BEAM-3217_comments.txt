   @chamikaramj could you take a look whether this PR is going to a good direction? What do you think about the idea of using JdbcIO to write the data (there is no write in HadoopInputFormatIO)? 
   
   Currently the test is working only for small datasets (100 000 rows, which is about 3,43 MB). For 1 000 000 (and above) rows the test is flaky (different hashes get generated). I'm investigating the cause right now.
   
   For a large scale scenario: will 100 000 000 (3,4 GB) rows of data be enough, or should we generate even larger dataset?
