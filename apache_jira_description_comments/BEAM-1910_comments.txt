[~kirpichov] I could not reproduce this in 3 runs. (I am running the {{mvn}} command under {{sdks/python}}.) It is possible that by running at root or by running more time I can reproduce it.

In the output there should be a section that looks like:
======================================================================
ERROR: test_using_slow_impl (apache_beam.coders.slow_coders_test.SlowCoders)
...

Could you check your output to see if that exists? (You can also search for 'Traceback' in the output).

Got the error again.

======================================================================
FAIL: test_using_slow_impl (apache_beam.coders.slow_coders_test.SlowCoders)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):

AssertionError: ImportError not raised


I guess I also would like a way to run mvn verify but skip the python tests - they are not helpful when I'm verifying a Java-only PR.

{{ImportError}} happens when cython implementation is found but it is expected to be not there. [~vikasrk], I remember you resolved this issue earlier. Do you know why it might happen? (Could it  be that cleanup phase did not really cleanup the files? Maybe we can move clean up phase to py27 target before running the tests.) 

On the second question, we could potentially add a flag similar to {{skipTests}} to skip python tests only (https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/pom.xml#L184). 



Vikas, any updates? This is heavily interfering with the ability to run mvn verify locally.

Yeah most likely related to cleanups. Now that c and so files are added to gitignore, we might not notice them, but they were probably not cleaned up.
