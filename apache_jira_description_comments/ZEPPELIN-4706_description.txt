as part of ZEPPELIN-4700, it was attempted to bump versions of surefire & other plugins, but this lead to failure of multiple Spark tests (https://travis-ci.org/github/alexott/zeppelin/builds/668604896). After reverting surefire plugin back to 2.17 (from 2.22.2), these tests are passing (https://travis-ci.org/github/alexott/zeppelin/builds/668812389). 

it would be useful to understand what causes this behavior as it could be a sign of flaky tests.
