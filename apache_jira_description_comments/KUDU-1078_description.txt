JD accidentally configured botl80 so that all nodes were writing to a single tablet (talk about a stress test!) I see the following warning occasionally in the leader logs:

W0827 11:34:04.051275 55950 consensus_queue.cc:272] T d6ff74fb04454712873abd0d2328e59b P 668314723deb4a818cc9a43eba51073c [LEADER]: The logs necessary to catch up peer 600e62435ca24425b29c00d9726b78be have been garbage collected. The follower will never be able to catch up (Not found: op in future). Instructing remote peer to remotely bootstrap.

Calling this a blocker because, if we couple this with the "automatically re-bootstrap nodes if they fall behind", we'll be accidentally deleting tablets when this happens (no good!)
