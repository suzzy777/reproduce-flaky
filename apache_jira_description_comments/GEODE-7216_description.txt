Currently the ExportStackTraceCommand dumps stack traces with a head for each member like:
{noformat}
*** Stack-trace for member server3 ***
{noformat}
It would be nice for support purposes if it included a timestamp like:
{noformat}
*** Stack-trace for member server3 at 2019-09-16 10:39:57 ***
{noformat}
That'll help correlate stack traces with logs and stats.

Something like:
{noformat}
ps.append(STACK_TRACE_FOR_MEMBER).append(entry.getKey()).append(" at ")
    .append(new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss").format(new Date())).append(" ***")
    .append(System.lineSeparator());
{noformat}
