It is interesting that it fails with OOM.

Yes, I haven't had time to track which commit broke it, but I have had CI failing from time to time due to OOM in this test for quite some time now (like few months), it's not that frequent though.

As I don't have much time to dive deep into this, for me the best course of action at the moment is to disable the test and create a ticket to investigate it and re-enable it later.

I just merged the PR https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/8423601b934b146ebbb42972cc11ec8b81dd5a92. How do we move forward? We keep this ticket open or create a new one to track remaining work? [~asolimando] Leaving the decision up to you!

Thanks [~zabetak] for the review and merge, I have filed and linked HIVE-26828 to this ticket, which can now be closed!
