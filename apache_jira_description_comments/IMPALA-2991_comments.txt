  IMPALA-2345,2991: test coverage for spilling and sorts

Add missing coverage for sorting by CHAR and VARCHAR.

Add more coverage for spilling sorts.

Fix spilling tests: ensure that they actually reliably spill (many of
them had memory limits high enough that they could run entirely in
memory).

I ran this in a loop for a while to flush out flaky tests. The tests
should be fairly predictable given that they're not run concurrently
with other tests and we allocate enough block manager memory so that
each operator can obtain its reservation.
