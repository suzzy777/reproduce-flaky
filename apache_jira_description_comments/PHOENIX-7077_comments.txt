The cause is that the permission changes are not synchronous, and there is no easy way to check when they are applied.

I wonder how come i have not seen permission test failures on many of the recent master branch PRs but seen them on 5.1 PRs with high frequency.

It MAY be simply caused by more demanding tests being run on 5.1 parallel with them due to how the parallel test execution plays out on the different branches on the CI hosts.
