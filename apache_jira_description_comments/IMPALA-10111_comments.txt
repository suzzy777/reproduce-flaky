I wonder if it just aged out of the query logs and could be fixed by increasing the query log size...

Anyway I'm not having luck reproducing it so I'll close it out.

If it reoccurs we should attach logs

This recurred 5 times this year, checked the logs of the latest failure but nothing suspicious, the queries finished quite fast ~0.3 seconds. I think we could print the json in case of a failure to better understand whether the queries were in another state or aged out of the log (, like in  IMPALA-9751). Created a CR for this:

IMPALA-10111: Improve TestWebPage::test_query_stmt logging

TestWebPage::test_query_stmt is flaky, to better understand the root
cause of this test failure this commit adds the web page JSON result
to the error message.

Testing:
 - Executed the test locally.

[~tmate] does it matter if the query statement being looked up is in 'completed_queries' or 'in_flight_queries'? Because it might still in flight when the json page is being queried.

IMPALA-10111: Fix TestWebPage::test_query_stmt flakiness

A query might be logged in "in_flight_queries" even though it has
already finished. Earlier the test only looked for the executed query
in "completed_queries", after this commit it will look in both lists.

Moreover, removed unnecessary duplicated execution of the query and
added formatting to dumped response to ease debugging in the future.

Testing:
 - Locally reproducible for the first test run after starting the
cluster.
 - Verified that the query is found in in_flight_queries too and the
test passes in this case.
