It seems like the test failed because exhaustive run pass compiler flags -DNDEBUG and strip out the line that should do the delay injection

[https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/5e69ae1/be/src/runtime/runtime-filter.cc#L85]

I will remove the enclosing macro so that the delay injection is kept.

IMPALA-9650: Fix flakiness in RuntimeFilterTest

IMPALA-9612 adds RuntimeFilterTest to the set of backend tests. It
adds a delay injection code in runtime-filter.cc to reproduce the race
condition. However, the delay injection code will be stripped out when
Impala is build with release config. This patch remove the NDEBUG
macro enclosing the delay injection code so that it will not be
stripped out in release build.

Testing:
- Ran and pass pass backend tests against release build.
