Thanks for picking this up [~dbist13]! Will you have the time to work on this soon? OOZIE-2004 is breaking some of our internal integration tests and we would like to fix them quickly.

[~gezapeti] I don't want to be a bottleneck, I reassigned as I don't know my availability. Thank you for understanding.

Thanks for the quick response! I'll take care of this one :)

Attaching fix.

I've decided to keep the new format and add the old one back as well.

Thanks [~gezapeti]!
+1 pending on your confirmation that UI shows the correct version. In that case, we can safely resolve OOZIE-3152 and include this one for 5.0.0-beta1.

[~gezapeti] I applied the patch, created a distro with {{bin/mkdistro.sh}} and installed ext2.2. I can confirm that build version is displayed on the Web UI.

However, I don't like the response to request sent to "v2/admin/build-version":
{code}
curl 'http://localhost:11000/oozie/v2/admin/build-version'  
{"buildVersion":"5.0.0-beta1","buildInfo":"{build.time=2018.01.07-07:18:42GMT, vc.url=https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/oozie.git, build.user=asasvari, vc.revision=master@dde1284, build.version=5.0.0-beta1}"}
{code}
It is not a valid JSON.

I believe ObjectMapper should be used. For example:
{code}
        Map<String, Object> m = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        m.put("buildVersion", BuildInfo.BUILD_VERSION);
        m.put("buildInfo", BuildInfo.getBuildInfo());

        ObjectMapper objectMap = new ObjectMapper() ;
        try {
            System.out.println(objectMap.writeValueAsString(m));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
{code}
would return 
{code}
{"buildVersion":"build.version","buildInfo":{"build.time":"${build.time}","vc.url":"${vc.url}","build.user":"asasvari","vc.revision":"${vc.revision}","build.version":"5.0.0-beta1"}}
{code}

Thanks for pointing that issue out [~asasvari]! I'm updating the patch to give back proper JSON

Thanks [~gezapeti]. I tested your patch and {{curl 'http://localhost:11000/oozie/v2/admin/build-version'}} returned 
{code}
{"buildVersion":"5.0.0-beta1","buildInfo":"{\"build.time\":\"${build.time}\",\"vc.url\":\"${vc.url}\",\"build.user\":\"asasvari\",\"vc.revision\":\"${vc.revision}\",\"build.version\":\"5.0.0-beta1\"}"}
{code}
{{buildInfo}} is not a JSON object, it is a string. This is caused by {{json.put(JsonTags.BUILD_INFO, JSONValue.toJSONString(BuildInfo.getBuildInfo()));}}.; the JSON object converted to a string that is not what is needed here.

In {{BaseAdminServlet.doGet()}}, you could simply do something like {{json.put(JsonTags.BUILD_INFO,  BuildInfo.getBuildInfo());}}}, which would return:
{code}
{"buildVersion":"5.0.0-beta1","buildInfo":{"build.version":"5.0.0-beta1","vc.url":"https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/oozie.git","vc.revision":"master@dde1284","build.time":"2018.01.08-16:15:03GMT","build.user":"asasvari"}}
{code}
({{json.writeJSONString()}} knows how to serialize the embedded object in the JSONObject we pass to {{sendJsonResponse()}})

In Javascript, you can then parse this with with {{JSON.parse()}}. Escaped slashes are handled as expected; {{JSON.parse(response).buildInfo\["vc.url"]}} returns "https://github.com/apache/oozie.git" (note: because the key contains a dot, the dot operator cannot be use to select "vc.url").

[~gezapeti] do you have capacity to work on this? I would happily take it over if you don't mind.

Thanks for the review [~asasvari]! Patch-4 is my last attempt. It it's still not working properly, please take it over. :)
