Any volunteers? I think this could be converted to a top level issue and you can create sub tasks to implement the individual methods of it.

[~Apache9] I am interested in this. Can I assign this issue to me?

Sure. Go ahead.

I will take the charge of Region Admin Operations.  :)

+1 to put an example on the release note ;)

So what's the status of this issue? Have we done? [~zghaobac] [~openinx].

There are two sub-task need to resolve. HBASE-18003 is about the flaky ut. And HBASE-18052 is about doc, examples for async admin. Thanks.

Assigned myself with HBASE-18003 and HBASE-18052. 

https://builds.apache.org/job/HBASE-Find-Flaky-Tests/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dashboard.html. Seems TestAsync*Admin unit tests are not flaky anymore. So the only block thing is HBASE-18052 to add doc and example for async admin.

I thought all Admin's methods were done in AsyncAdmin, so I said the only blocking thing is the document in previous comment. But toady I compared AsyncAdmin with Admin interface and found some methods which were not implemented...... I will open new issues to fill them. Thanks.

Now all methods in Admin are implemented in AsyncAdmin. So the only block thing is the document. [~Apache9] Can you take a look about the new doc in HBASE-18052? Thanks.

All sub-tasks have been resolved.
