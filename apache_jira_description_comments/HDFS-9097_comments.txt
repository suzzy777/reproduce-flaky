Thanks Andrew for reviewing! The test failures are unrelated. {{TestWebHDFSOAuth2}} pass locally (seems to be a library loading issue). {{testWriteStripedFileWithDNFailure}} is flaky in the branch nightly Jenkins and we should fix it (as a new subtask).

The findbug issues are pre-existing as well, being addressed in HDFS-8550.
