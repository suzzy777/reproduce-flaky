This issue is the follow-up work of [ZOOKEEPER-3057|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3057]
1.ZK server side supports ipv6 style like this: server.1=[2001:db8:1::242:ac11:2]:2888:3888,but zk client side supports ipv6 like this:2001:db8:1::242:ac11:2:2181.we need unify them.
 Look at the kafka example [KAFKA-1123|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1123].Â its producer client also supports ipv6 like this: [2001:db8:1::242:ac11:2]
2.document the "IPV6 feature" to let user know.
