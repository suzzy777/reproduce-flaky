I'm hoping that my PR for this JIRA fixes the issue: [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9805]

This and other pyspark streaming ML failures seem to be caused by the heavy Jenkins workload, and my PR should help some with that.

Is this still a test people are finding flakey or did [~josephkb]'s fix work?
