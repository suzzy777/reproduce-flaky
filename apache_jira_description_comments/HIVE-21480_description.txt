[TestHiveMetaStore#testJDOPersistanceManagerCleanup|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/standalone-metastore/metastore-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/TestHiveMetaStore.java#L3140-L3162] tests whether the JDO persistence manager cache cleanup was performed correctly when a HiveMetaStoreClient executes an API call, and closes. It does this by ensuring that the cache object count before the API call, and after closing, are the same. However, there are some assumptions that are not always correct, and can cause flakiness.

For example, lingering resources could be present from previous tests or from setup depending on how PTest runs it, and can cause the object count to sometimes be incorrect. We should rewrite this test to account for this flakiness that can occur.
