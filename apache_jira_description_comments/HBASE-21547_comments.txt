this would be a great improvement.

[~busbey] is this intentional? I see that PreCommit job defines EXCLUDE_TESTS_URL with master URL with this comment:

List of flakey tests found by the HBASE-Find-Flaky-Tests sibling job.

N.B. by default all precommit runs rely on the list from master

It was intentional at first, because we only had a flaky list from master. Then it was "let's do this later" because I was out of time for working on updating the flaky infra.

 

If we have a branch at that point, updating precommit to use the corresponding flaky list would be great. I'm not sure if it makes HBASE-19265 more or less pressing. Since I'm usually concerned about branches that aren't master, probably more pressing for me. :)

(!) A patch to the testing environment has been detected. 
Re-executing against the patched versions to perform further tests. 
The console is at https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/15407/console in case of problems.

so the idea is on our precommit job we'd stop defining EXCLUDE_TESTS_URL, hit this logic, and thus get the correct branch.

+1 looks good.

Yes, right now PreCommit job has EXCLUDE_TESTS_URL=[https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/excludes/] by default. The plan is to remove the default value and use the branch specific exclude list. If for any reason we'd like to use other exclude list we can just set the value for a single test run.

Thanks for the review. Pushed to all branches.
