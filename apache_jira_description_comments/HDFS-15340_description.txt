This Jira implements the basic framework(Balance Procedure Scheduler) of the hdfs federation balance tool. 

 The Balance Procedure Scheduler implements a state machine. It’s responsible for scheduling a balance job, including submit, run, delay and recover. See the documentation at HDFS-15374/patch-v05 for a detailed description of the state machine.
