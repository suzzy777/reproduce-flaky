The [*current authorization model*|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE-228] does not fit the enterprise requirements as everything is readable and writable by everyone by default.

Write access can be restricted using authorization but restricting read rights is only possible via Yarn ACLs and HDFS rights which still does not prevent accessing the workflow, coordinator or bundle job’s configurations for everyone.

Improve authorization so it’s possible to configure read/write access for workflows, coordinators, and bundles in a more granular way. Could involve Sentry during implementation or create and design a new system that fits the needs.
