Right now we have a separate directory for .NET Core tests, and most test files are shared across Apache.Ignite.Core.Tests and Apache.Ignite.Core.Tests.DotNetCore projects.

Move Apache.Ignite.Core.Tests.DotNetCore.csproj to Apache.Ignite.Core.Tests directory, so that all tests are included into DotNetCore project by default.

Incompatible tests should be excluded specifically from the project, or using compiler directives (#if !NETCOREAPP).
