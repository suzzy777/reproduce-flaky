Also happened in https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Commit/17610/

Just happened twice in a row.. 

I've had this happen to me three times in a row (so far). One run even had the same failure twice: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Phrase/3768/

I thought perhaps we could bisect to the breaking change, so I tried reproducing this via:

{noformat}
./gradlew runners:flink:1.11:test --tests "org.apache.beam.runners.flink.FlinkSavepointTest.testSavepointRestoreLegacy" --info
{noformat}

with this patch to re-run the test every time:

{noformat}
index 9c8ee14c34..b3e517b6aa 100644
--- a/runners/flink/flink_runner.gradle
+++ b/runners/flink/flink_runner.gradle

     }
     mustRunAfter(":runners:flink:${version}:test")
   }
+   outputs.upToDateWhen { false }
 }
 {noformat}

Not sure what's happening.  Perhaps side effects from other tests or flink processes OOMing in some cases, for example when Jenkins happens to run some other test suite in parallel, and there is not enough memory.

Given only 'Legacy' tests seem to be failing temporarily disabling the flaky test SGTM.

I've started getting the test failures again. Looks like [PR15119|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15119] still needs to be merged to re-disable the test.

Reiterating a Github comment here:

From the additional logs in the build scan, it looks like Flink job is failing when the savepoint is attempted due to a failed precondition. It looks like the failed precondition is checking {{alignmentDurationNanos}} >= -1. I'm not sure however what the unacceptable value is, nor where it is coming from.

It looks like it's possibly a Flink bug, so I filed FLINK-23302.
