    Test mass runs

The reason for tests crashes is the TcpDiscoveryMulticastIpFinder IP finder. After replacement by TcpDiscoveryVmIpFinder it works fine. Also, test duration decreased up to 8x times. 
 
The issue will be resolved by the issue IGNITE-10555. 


These tests were fixed by IGNITE-10555. See the test's history: [testReconnectServer|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&testNameId=-4837559557126450615&tab=testDetails&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=<default>], [testReconnectClient|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&testNameId=-93777049115891327&tab=testDetails&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=<default>].
