[~cody@koeninger.org] Will you have time to take a look at these two kafka 0.10 tests?

I can take a look but there's not a lot to go on.

closing this, can't find any recent examples of this on Jenkins and haven't experienced this locally either as of late.
Also tried reproducing this running 1k+ loops of all the Kafka0.10_2.11 tests with 3 forks in parallel without issues.
