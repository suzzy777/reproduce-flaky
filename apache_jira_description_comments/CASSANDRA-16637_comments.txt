I can reproduce it locally, haven't worked on that area of the code but I will give it a try. If anyone has any hints - feel free to chime in, I will work more actively on it tomorrow afternoon

/CC [~marcuse] in case you have any hints as I see you were the last one working in that area of the code as part of CASSANDRA-16552. Not saying that ticket is the reason for the flakiness, but you might have an idea already on what is going on. :) 

^ I was looking at this one also in the background and reached similar conclusions as far as I went. Seems there could be a race somewhere as to repro locally you have to change the sleeps. It's very time sensitive.

A few observations:
 * I can reproduce failures with overlapping sometimes level 1, sometimes level 3.
 * The issue was there before  CASSANDRA-16552  but less obvious, failed for me after 24 runs.
 * As per Marcus' suggestion I tried to  set _sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb=-1_ and I can confirm that the issue is still reproducible.

Reassigning to Marcus as per Slack, thank you!

Looks like this can happen for two reasons - first we seem to be notifying the compaction strategies twice about the sstables that are getting removed after compaction - first via a [SSTableDeletingNotification|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/lifecycle/LogTransaction.java#L192] and then via a [SSTableListChangedNotification|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/lifecycle/LifecycleTransaction.java#L233]. This means that there is a small window where LCS doesn't know about the old or the new sstables, and in this case we might pick sstables for compaction that cause overlap with those new sstables.

Secondly there is a window after compaction where both the old and new sstables are 'live', so if we [reload|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/CompactionStrategyManager.java#L509] the compaction strategies just in that moment, both will be added to the compaction strategy and there will be overlaps (say we were compacting L2 -> L3, we will create a bunch of new L3 sstables from a set of L2 + L3 sstables, so the old + new L3 sstables will overlap)

Both these issues are currently handled by sending the offending sstable to L0, which of course is inefficient if its the new sstable getting getting sent there. This is not a new issue in 4.0 so I don't think we should block GA on it.

I'll work on fixes for these issues, but changing fix version.

Thanks a lot [~marcuse]!
As one of the requirements for GA release is the CI to be fully green in 5 consecutive runs, I was wondering also whether to mark this test as flaky and trigger 1 rerun on failure until the bugs are fixed, what do you think?

^What if through {{CassandraVersion}} we skip the test if version == 4.0? Googling a bit seems {{org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition())}}  in the {{BeforeClass}} would skip the test. Disclaimer: I haven't tried it.

If we wanted to avoid skpping the full test we could catch the specific failure, which seems to be always the same, and not fail if version==4.0. wdyt?

I think we might miss different type of failure or further regression if we completely skip it, I will defer the decision to [~marcuse]. I guess it also depends on when he will have the time to work on the patch.

patch to temporarily skip the overlap check: https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commits/marcuse/16637
cci: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/krummas/cassandra?branch=marcuse%2F16637

LGTM, maybe we can actually just comment it for later instead of removing? I will defer the decision to you [~marcuse]. Thank you!

I would also favor commenting it out with a note and a ticket reference. Although my preference would be to try to skip by actually detecting the version if that is possible and we're not in a hot path. I would also open a ticket as a reminder. Hope it makes sense.

This is not only 4.0 issue and also we already have this ticket open so I don't see a reason to open new one or check versions.

{quote}This is not a new issue in 4.0 so I don't think we should block GA on it.{quote}

iiuc this ticket will unblock 4.0 GA as this is an issue that existed previously. So we will remove that fix now but we need to open a new ticket to properly fix this issue in the future if I am not missing anything.

The issue will be fixed as part of this ticket, [~marcuse] removed the check that is failing for tests and used only in the tests in order to clean the noise in the CI until the issue is resolved. No need of a new ticket or something. 

This is still [coming up|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-4.0/70/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction/LongLeveledCompactionStrategyCQLTest/stressTestCompactionStrategyManager/] in 4.0 CI

Didn't we settle we'd at least merge that check removal to get a clean CI in 4.0? #collaborating

right, I'll commit

https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/aef535cae16986c10f635e71dcbcf0759310ac29 to 4.0 and merged up

That was fast! thx :-)
