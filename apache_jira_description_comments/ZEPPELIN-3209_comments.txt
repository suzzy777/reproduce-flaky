    ZEPPELIN-3209. Preserve thread context classloader when running jobs in RemoteInterpreterServer 

    ### What is this PR for?
    Spark jobs may change current thread context classloader sometimes.
    
    For example in case of issue ZEPPELIN-2475 using Spark 2.2 and Scala 2.11.8 when you run DepInterpreter that will start SparkILoop --> ILoop which changes the current thread context classloader, from LauncherAppClassloader to ScalaClassloader@URLClassloader. This result in classloading problems when SparkInterpreter is trying to build up Spark Context, in case SparkInterpreter is started by scheduler on same thread.
    
    In short when running subsequent paragraphs, users will get an ambiguous NullPointerException, which is hard to understand as it hides the root cause of the problem. As a safety measure to prevent such cases RemoteInterpreterServer should save & restore original thread context classloader.
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    [Bug Fix]
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    * https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3209
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    * Use Spark 2.2 and Scala 2.11.8
    * create a notebook with two paragraphs
    * in first paragraph use %spark.dep interpreter and add load some dependencies
    * in second paragraph use %spark interpreter and run some spark code
    
    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update?
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions?
    * Does this needs documentation?

    Thanks @sancyx for the contribution.
    It looks good, but i'd like to see if it passes CI. 
    
    Could you try setup CI and trigger build?
    
    ```
    Looks like travis-ci is not configured for your fork.
    Please setup by swich on 'zeppelin' repository at https://travis-ci.org/profile and travis-ci.
    And then make sure 'Build branch updates' option is enabled in the settings https://travis-ci.org/banzaicloud/zeppelin/settings.
    
    To trigger CI after setup, you will need ammend your last commit with
    git commit --amend
    git push your-remote HEAD --force
    
    See http://zeppelin.apache.org/contribution/contributions.html#continuous-integration.
    Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure

    Let me know if you need any help on CI.

    Hi @Leemoonsoo, I've set up travis and as I see there are some errors in some builds, however they are quite strange it doesn't seems to be related to this PR, could you please take a look?

    Okay, let me take a look and see if errors are related to this change or not.

    I ran CI test of this branch https://travis-ci.org/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin/builds/343475153 in my travis account. And build went success. I think previous error was flaky test unrelated to this PR.
    
    LGTM and merge to master and branch-0.8.
