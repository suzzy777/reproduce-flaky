The test in {{EnableKudu1097AndDownTS/MoveTabletParamTest.Test/0}} configuration sometime fails with the following error message:

{noformat}
src/kudu/tools/kudu-admin-test.cc:390: Failure

Illegal state: Leader has not yet committed an operation in its own term
{noformat}

To fix, it's necessary to make sure the newly elected leader commits at least one Raft transaction on its term (e.g. something similar to what {{WaitForLeaderWithCommittedOp}} does).  One option is to perform a DDL operation (e.g. add a column) before attempting Raft configuration change corresponding to the replica movement.

I attached the full log of a run where the test scenario failed.
