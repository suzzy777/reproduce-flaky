As far as I can tell, there should be a file in that directory. Not sure what is going on. I can't reproduce locally. I will try to add some more debugging info for when it reproduces again.

I saw this again, but unfortunately not on a branch with the logging.

We found in a recent TSAN build that BufferPoolTest.WriteErrorBlacklistHolepunch failed on FindPageInDir check at https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/be/src/runtime/bufferpool/buffer-pool-test.cc#L1792.

The error message we saw in the console output is in the following.

In {{buffer-pool-test.ERROR}} we saw quite a few Disk I/O errors, each being followed by an access denied error.

The corresponding error logs are also provided.

[~fangyurao] can you also include the LastTest/LastTestFailed log files?

Thanks [~tarmstrong]! I have attached those 2 files.


Encountered the failed test of {{WriteErrorBlacklistCompression}}. Provided the corresponding here as well. [^impala-cdpd-master-staging-core-tsan_111.tar.gz] 

[~fangyurao] thanks for attaching, I'll take a look.

FWIW the error logs in the ERROR file are likely unrelated - these tests do deliberately induce errors so that's expected.

So from the failed assertion we have:

It's weird that both pages got backed by the same temp dir, because the allocation should be round-robin. II looked at the code and I do think there's some actual non-determinism here because of the way Pin() runs asynchronously until the actual buffer is requested - it may not actually complete for one of these pages. I think if one thread went down this code path on one page but not the other, the allocation may not be round robin -

IMPALA-10216: make TestWriteErrorBlacklist deterministic

There is a subtle bug in the test where it does a BufferPool::Pin()
call followed immediately by a BufferPool::Unpin() call. This is
meant to ensure that a new scratch range is allocated for the file,
but does not guarantee that because the Pin() is asynchronous and
there is a short-circuit case in buffer pool that cancels the
Pin() if it the page is unpinned before the pin completes.

We can force the pin to complete by requesting the actual buffer
for the page (and verifying the data for good measure).

Testing:
I was never able to reproduce this race locally, but the fix
is pretty safe and I looped the modified test for a while.
