[~chenhd] Your change looks good to me overall.

However, may you please fix these errors Jenkins reported and one minor typo?
{noformat}
. -1 the patch contains 1 star import(s)
. -1 the patch contains 4 line(s) longer than 132 characters 
----
it would be lose. => it would be lost.
private XLog log => can be final{noformat}
Removing the unused imports from the affected classes are also very welcome.

 

Let me start additional tests on your change (~ 1 day). If those passes and the above issues are fixed I think we are good to merge.

[~dionusos] I am sorry for that. I had fixed in [^OOZIE-3717-003.patch]

Thanks for your time.

Commit 3c614c74cb5cb8897a2f95334b5e467227edf740 in oozie's branch refs/heads/master from Denes Bodo
[ https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=oozie.git;h=3c614c74c ]

OOZIE-3717 When fork actions parallel submit, becasue ForkedActionStartXCommand and ActionStartXCommand has the same name, so ForkedActionStartXCommand would be lost, and cause deadlock (chenhd via dionusos)


Thanks [~chenhd] for your contribution. Your change is merged to master.
