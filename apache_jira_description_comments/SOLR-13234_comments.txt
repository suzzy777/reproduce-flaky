Ran ant precommit on the linked PR last night. Had a few small issues which I pushed a fix for and now it's passing successfully.

ant test from the root of the repo, appears to have a few flaky tests, that don't seem to be linked to the solr-prometheus-exporter. (just running the exporter tests seems to be fine).

FWIW, you can see historically test results here:

Thanks Erick. That's good to know (y)

Thanks Danyal, great stuff!

A few comments:
# In SolrCloudScraper.pingAllCores and metricsForAllHosts methods, any exception thrown during the ping (inside the function passed to the sendRequestsInParallel method) will cause the http clients to leak. The call to closeAll should be in a try-finally clause.
# We should have some sane defaults for connection and read timeout on the HttpSolrClient that is created. Even better if we can set a value through the configuration.
# Related to the above, it'd be nice to create an HttpClient instance using values loaded from the configuration and use it across all the different CloudSolrClient and HttpSolrClient instances that are created. That way, the http connections can be re-used during ping and fetching metrics.

Thanks for the updates to the PR Danyal. It looks good to me. If there are no objections, I'll merge it tomorrow.

SOLR-13234: Prometheus Metric Exporter not threadsafe.

This changes the prometheus exporter to collect metrics from Solr on a fixed interval controlled by this tool and prevents concurrent collections. This change also improves performance slightly by using the cluster state instead of sending multiple HTTP requests to each node to lookup all the cores.

This closes #571.

Thanks Danyal. I added a blurb about the scrape interval to the reference guide as well. I'll try to backport this to branch_7x and branch_7_7 as well.

Here is a patch that applies on branch_7x. I'll commit after running precommit and tests.

Thanks for all the help Shalin! :)

Thanks for finding this Hoss. My bad, I've just looked at the test and the intent is to see if there are any Solr JVM metrics for each node being reported by the exporter. However it specifically looks for the count of terminated threads, I suspect in this case no threads have currently been terminated.

It should be a pretty simple update to fix this test. I can send a PR tonight/tomorrow morning to address this. However I'm not sure if it's best to open a new PR or add an additional commit to the original one.

Thanks Hoss.

[~danyal] - I am not sure either but a new PR will probably be easier to merge.

Sorry for the delay in looking at this. Just pushed a PR which fixes this test case here:

[https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/605]

It was due to the Prometheus label "terminated" in the test not being localized, but the label from Solr being localized to "termınated" {{}} on a JVM with Turkish locale. I've removed checking the actual label as these could change based on JVM config and instead checked that we get the correct number of labels back for JVM thread settings (which I think is potentially a more complete test).

SOLR-13234: Fix for turkish locales

WhenSolrExporterIntegrationTest.jvmMetrics ran on a JVM with the Turkish locale, (test seed: 62880F3B9F140C89). The JVM metric for terminated thread-count has a dotless-i e.g. termınated.
This causes the check for matching metrics to fail.

We could normalize the text in this case, however I think it's better to ensure we have the correct total number of JVM thread metrics rather than looking at Prometheus labels which maybe localized.

This closes #605.

Wouldn't it be worth noting somewhere that this goes against the best practices for writing exporters given in [Prometheus documentation|https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#scheduling]?

Closing after the 7.7.2 release
