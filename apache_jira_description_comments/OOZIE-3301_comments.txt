[~kmarton] do you have free cycles to work on this one?

[~andras.piros], yes, I can work on it

Thanks [~kmarton]!

Hi [~kmarton] thanks for working on it, we should ideally review all the licenses of included Oozie dependencies (extjs etc).  Maybe you could use a maven plugin or some tool to automate this.

Hi [~asasvari], in the documentation there is a reference to the dependencies report and their licences (which actually is broken, but I have opened a Jira for it: OOZIE-3302). Do you think that we should include more information in the NOTICE.txt, or it would be enough to have a reference to the documentation?

According to the linked Redistribution part ([http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html#redistribution]) is enough to have it in one place.

Thanks for digging into it, and filing the JIRA about the broken link to the Dependencies Report, Licenses section.

Here are some examples from other Apache projects:
- Hadoop: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/NOTICE.txt
- HBase: https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/master/NOTICE.txt
- Spark: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/NOTICE-binary
- Kafka: https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/NOTICE
- Flink: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/NOTICE

[Oozie license text file|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/LICENSE.txt]  lists many licenses but there are dependencies (such as jetty, netty, gmetric4j, JSch) that are not mentioned / license is missing.

Maven has a [license plugin|https://www.mojohaus.org/license-maven-plugin/] that migth be useful, but it needs further investigation.

The third party licences can be generated using Maven License plugins add-third-party goal (

mvn license:add-third-party). This will generate for each module THIRD-PARTY.txt file containing all the third party dependency licenses (see the attached [^THIRD-PARTY.txt]. This is the report for the server module).

[~andras.piros], [~asalamon74], [~asasvari] what about generating every time those files? The files are quite long and one license is displayed more times (for each dependency), but generating those, for sure we will not forget to include the new licences.

{color:red}-1{color} Patch failed to apply to head of branch

[~kmarton] best would be:
 * using an automatic method, e.g. {{maven-license-plugin}}
 * generating {{NOTICE.txt}} or, even better, {{NOTICE.md}}
 * as one accumulated file for all the dependencies
 * each dependency merged additively to the main {{NOTICE.md}} file

I think regenerating the {{NOTICE.md}} on every build is a burden, regenerating it once every release as per {{bin/create-release-artifact}} would be OK. [~asasvari] what do you think?

I also like the idea of an automatic solution instead of manually updating the NOTICE markdown file.

If we want only to list the third party modules then we can ignore the oozie modules listed in the file.
