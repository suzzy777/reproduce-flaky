As part of schema provisioning project we want to allow hybrid model for Row set-based scan framework, namely to allow to pass custom schema metadata which can be partial.

Currently schema provisioning has SchemaContainer class that contains the following information (can be obtained from metastore, schema file, table function):
1. schema represented by org.apache.drill.exec.record.metadata.TupleMetadata
2. properties represented by Map<String, String>, can contain information if schema is strict or partial (default is partial) etc.
