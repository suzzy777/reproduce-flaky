It's somewhat difficult to reproduce it in 3.0, but with 3.X it can be reproduced 33 times in a [multiplexed run|https://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/stef1927/job/stef1927-testall-multiplex/36/] of 250 iterations.

I'm now testing a [patch|https://github.com/stef1927/cassandra/commits/12801-3.X] where I've disabled the key cache for all tables except the test tables, results should appear [here|https://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/stef1927/job/stef1927-testall-multiplex/37/].

The previous multiplexed run returned only one [failure|https://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/stef1927/job/stef1927-testall-multiplex/37/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.cql3/KeyCacheCqlTest_47/testKeyCacheClusteredIndexInfoOnHeap/], which is better than 33 but still not OK. The metrics registered an unexpected request. My guess is that there was an unexpected flush due to the asynchronous cleanup of the keyspace in {{CQLTester}}, because I've seen it happen in another flaky unit test. So I've changed keyspace to {{KEYSPACE_PER_TEST}}, which is cleaned up synchronously, and launched another run [here|https://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/stef1927/job/stef1927-testall-multiplex/38/].

No failures in the previous multiplexed [run|https://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/stef1927/job/stef1927-testall-multiplex/38/]. Repeating another one [here|https://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/stef1927/job/stef1927-testall-multiplex/39/] to be extra sure.

Latest multiplexed run for 3.X also completed without failures, this is ready for review:

I've launched the dtests only on one branch since they should not be affected by these changes.

The 3.X patch applied to trunk without conflicts. The 3.0 patch was backported from 3.X and had both conflicts and missing methods in {{CQLTester}}, which were also backported from 3.X.


CI results are good, the failing unit tests are not related.

LGTM, +1

Thank you for the review, committed to 3.0 as c0886d87728a0f0a73b20edcd39373fa1458aba0 and merged upwards.
