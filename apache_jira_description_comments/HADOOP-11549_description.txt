When running the tool from HADOOP-11045 on latest Hadoop-hdfs-trunk job, I'm seeing a problem here:

{code}
[yzhang@localhost jenkinsftf]$ ./determine-flaky-tests-hadoop.py -j Hadoop-hdfs-trunk 
****Recently FAILED builds in url: https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-hdfs-trunk
    THERE ARE 5 builds (out of 6) that have failed tests in the past 14 days, as listed below:

===>https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-hdfs-trunk/2026/testReport (2015-02-04 03:30:00)
    Could not open testReport, check https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-hdfs-trunk/2026/Console for why it was reported failed
...
{code}

I saw that the testReport can actually be opened from browser. After looking, I found that HDFS-7287 fix added the following test code:
{code}
//Create a directory whose name should be escaped in XML
Path invalidXMLDir = new Path("/dirContainingInvalidXMLChar\u0000here");
hdfs.mkdirs(invalidXMLDir);
...
{code}
And the output from this code caused the tool to choke. 

I found a solution here and I'm attaching a patch.
