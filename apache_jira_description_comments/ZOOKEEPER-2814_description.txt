I'm using the following connection string:

{{10.0.0.179:2181,<space>10.0.0.176:2181}}

However, I get:

{{java.net.UnknownHostException: 10.0.0.176: Name or service not known
at java.net.Inet6AddressImpl.lookupAllHostAddr(Native Method)
at java.net.InetAddress$2.lookupAllHostAddr(InetAddress.java:928)

The problem was the space after the comma. I suggest to either make the space optional or produce error on it, as this is a real pain to spot. Using the space also makes the connect string more readable. Spaces are not allowed in domain names.
