+1, LGTM

[~ifesdjeen] , [~jlewandowski] is not a committer yet so we have to commit this one for him.

He just rebased and ran CI here so I can help commit - [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/220/workflows/aeb85ab4-c69a-45c8-82ec-f810949d1317]

 

There is one new failure but I don't see how this patch can cause it. There were a lot of works committed before the freeze in the past two days. Anyway I am looping the test with latest trunk and the patch and I will commit after that if nothing proves me wrong in my judgement.

Trunk run:

[j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1575/workflows/f9409df6-825f-4996-976a-0182549d87dc/jobs/10405]

Patch run:

 [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1574/workflows/86dad3ef-e9c7-424f-9da9-ec22871d6588/jobs/10404]

The run just completed. It seems flaky test on trunk as I suspected, I will open a ticket and commit this one soon 

Committed here -

Thanks!

Ticket for the flaky test opened too - CASSANDRA-17587
