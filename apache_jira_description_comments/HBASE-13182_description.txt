Similar to HBASE-13179
TestNamespaceAuditor and the two test AccessController fail when create or delete table takes more time.and it is because the sync version of the Admin operation is not sync, but relies on the last operation on the server e.g. delete meta. 
but the post-operation method of the coprocessor is called after meta is deleted.. 
long story short, the client is not really sync and it will be fixed by HBASE-12439. 

similar to what we do in TestMasterObserver we can add an observer with a countDownLatch to wait the postOpHandler call.
