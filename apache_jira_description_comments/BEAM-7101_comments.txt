Can pick this up

[~elwinarens] Please send an email to dev mailing list and ask to be added to Beam JIRA, so that you can assign this issue to yourself.

Done, thanks.

Did you send it to dev@beam.apache.org, [~elwinarens]?

Yes, sent an e-mail to [dev@beam.apache.org|mailto:dev@beam.apache.org] requesting to be added to Beam JIRA.

Look like we drifted into using deprecated assertions in a few places again. 
We should investigate if our linters can catch this at precommit times. Would you be interested to take a look at that [~elwinarens]?

Currently we have usage of self.assertEquals in synthetic_pipeline_test.py, combiners_test.py, typehints_test.py

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8796 takes care of the remaining occurrences but we can still investigate strengthening lint rules. We can open a new issue for that.

Will try and pick this up this week and good point about the linting rule. I would suggest adding it together with the linting fixes, to prevent new additions. As long as tests don't fail on the lint rule, i think we'll keep seeing the issue reoccur.
