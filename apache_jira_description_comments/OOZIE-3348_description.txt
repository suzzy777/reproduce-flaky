As per HIVE-20020 the dependency {{org.apache.hive:hive-contrib}} is packaged differently - moved out of under Hive's lib.

{{oozie-sharelib-hive}} exports some of the Hive dependencies, and that includes {{hive-contrib.jar}}. In order to be synced with Hive we should remove it too.

Oozie doesn't depend on this jar runtime so there's no use of it being in {{oozie-sharelib-hive}} anyway.
