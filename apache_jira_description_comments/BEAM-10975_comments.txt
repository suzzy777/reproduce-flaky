This is caused by https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12727. If the fix is not obvious, the easiest way to unblock the release is to roll-back and cherry-pick the roll-back to the release branch.

Looks like capture_output arg for subprocess.run() is introduced after 3.7, will test out a fix by removing the arg.

Thank you Valentyn and Yichi! Please we me know when the PR is merged so I can cherry-pick.
