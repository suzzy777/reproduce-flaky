Now that we have OOZIE-1793, it will be really useful to have the pre-commit build generate a findbugs report.  It should probably before and after the patch and only complain it there are more after.  And it should link to the report.  Ideally, this would do some kind of diff (like Hadoop does) so it's easy to identify the new findbugs items.

You can generate the findbugs reports by running:
{noformat}
mvn verify -DskipTests
{noformat}
This also runs checkstyle
