Two minor things:
- Instead of destroying the {{SchedulerService}}, shouldn't we only need to destroy the {{StatusTransitService}}?
- Can we move the destroy before the init?  That way we don't even initialize the Service (just in case it has a chance to do something before it's destroyed).

 Just a thought, Instead of destroying the services, can we use {{XDataTestCase#setClassesToBeExcluded}} method for excluding the service in first. An example can be found in the {{TestStatusTransitService}} class. Thanks.

Oh, right.  I forgot about that.  Good idea.
