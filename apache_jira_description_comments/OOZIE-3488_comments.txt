[~zsombor], is the patch ready for kicking off a precommit build or is still work in progress? If is ready can you please change its state to patch available (submit patch)

PreCommit-OOZIE-Build started


I like the idea of eliminating the "obsolete" part of Guava, thanks for working on it. The modernized plugin ( OOZIE-3468 ) also suggested some of these changes. [~zsombor] Do you want to eliminate more guava classes in this jira?

Thanks. I've checked, and first I tried to focus on the methods, where there are clear, JVM based alternatives exist. 
ImmutableList/ImmutableMap/ImmutableSet could be converted too, but they are used somewhere more as sign of contract - like in org.apache.oozie.fluentjob.api.workflow.Parameters. 
Preconditions and Joiner can be substituted with commons-lang3, or some other commons-lib if agreed.
 There are still 253 'import com.google.common' in the code base, so it will become huge, if we try to merge it once, so I think, better postpone the rest for other tickets.
 

I agree, it's better to handle this is multiple jiras.

What about replacing {{Preconditions.checkNotNull}} with {{Objects.requireNonNull}}? Standard JDK7 class, no need for external libraries. Might be a separate jira of course. ( And we also have our own [ParamChecker.notNull|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/util/ParamChecker.java#L44] ).

Possibly Joiner could also be replaced without using an external library: https://stackoverflow.com/a/22577565/21348

Thanks, really good suggestions, I wasn't aware of this two little JDK helper method/class, I will open a new ticket about them, when I have time.

[~zsombor] I left a comment on the review board. Since you started to eliminate the Lists class it would be great to remove all the references to this class in this jira. For the other guava classes, separate jiras could be filed and addressed later.
