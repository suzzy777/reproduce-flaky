I did some bi-sect on builds, this failure is also cause by HBASE-21775 : 4e89d98d4adf24059a193efd3fb7f1143a936c90
It has been reverted now. Will monitor this test, it should be green  in next build.

It started fail since this build: https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-1/2379/ 

I'm not able to reproduce this with Azul's 1.8.0_172 (on mac). Executed the test 100 times

Closing, this test is not flaky anymore.
