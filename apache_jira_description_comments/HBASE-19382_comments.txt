Ping [~stack]. Please take a quick look?


+1 Try it.

Pushed to master. Thanks stack.

Don't we need this in all branches? [~appy]? The 1.2 nightly does a checkout of 1.2 and uses the dev-support from 1.2.

Nope.
Nightly jobs don't use this script. This job uses it  - https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/.
So there are two things:
1) It's use is independent of branch since it just uses jenkins jobs' output for generating report. We can point it to any job, 1.2, 1.3, master, etc.
2) Right now, we have flaky list only for master, so that job goes to https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase Nightly/job/master/ (--urls param) to collect test results for master. Setting it up for another branch will require setting up another set of these two jobs - [HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests|https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests] and [HBASE-Flaky-Tests|https://builds.apache.org/job/HBASE-Flaky-Tests/].
