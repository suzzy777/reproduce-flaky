As mentioned on SOLR-15781, the v2 API currently has an experimental designation, and the community has expressed an interest in using this period to update our v2 endpoints to be more REST-ful and consistent.  The current plan is to follow the specific changes laid out in [this spreadsheet|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAoBBFPpSiT8mJmgNZKkZAPwfCfPvlc08m5jz3fQBpA/edit?usp=sharing], though of course nothing there is set in stone and there are still warts to be worked out.

While we're touching the code for these endpoints, we should also convert them to JAX-RS framework definitions.  (This was initially tracked as a separate effort - see SOLR-16370 - but the edit that were required ended up overlapping so significantly with the "cosmetic" improvements here that in practice it almost always makes sense to do the two together.)

This ticket plans to tackle making the changes required for Solr's "node" APIs: those commands or actions that (primarily) affect the receiving node only such as log-level changes, setting and removing node roles, etc.  These are described in detail in the spreadsheet linked above, but summarized in the table below for convenience and ease of tracking.

*Cosmetic Changes and JAX-RS Conversion*
||API Name||Original Form||Desired Form||Status||Volunteer||
|-List Log Levels-|-GET /api/node/logging-|–GET /api/node/logging/levels–|-Finished-|-Calvince Otieno-|
|-Update Log Level-|-GET /api/node/logging?set=className:WARN-|-PUT /api/node/logging/levels-|-In Progress-|-Calvince Otieno-|
|-Retrieve Log Messages-|-GET /api/node/logging?since=123456789-|-GET /api/node/logging/messages?since=123456789-|-Finished-|-Calvince Otieno-|
|-Update LogWatcher Threshold-|-GET /api/node/logging?threshold=WARN-|-PUT /api/node/logging/messages/threshold-|-Finished-|-Calvince Otieno-|
|Add Role to Node|POST /api/cluster \{"add-role": \{...\}\}|PUT /api/nodes/nodeName/roles/roleName|Open|N/A|
|Remove Role from Node|POST /api/cluster \{"remove-role": \{...\}\}|DELETE /api/nodes/nodeName/roles/roleName|Open|N/A|

*JAX-RS Conversion Only*
||API Name||Endpoint||Status||Volunteer||
|List Threads on Node|GET /api/node/threads|Open|N/A|
