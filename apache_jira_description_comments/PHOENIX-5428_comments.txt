This probably applies to all active branches.

Should I upload patches for the other branches ?

{color:#FF0000}-1 tests included{color}.: This doesn't touch actual code. I have tested by running mvn checkstyle:check, which behaved similarly to running without the check ( I.e., throwing a zillion checkstyle verification errors)

{color:#FF0000}-1 release audit{color}. : IndexUpgradeToolTest.java indeed seems very broken, but I didn't touch it, and did not want mix an unrelated fix into the patch.

{color:#FF0000}-1 core tests{color}.: Looks like flaky tests, as I touched no code.

No worries on justifying QA report. It's obvious your changes are not related to its complaints :)

I see some other stuff we could improve, but this plugin upgrade seems fine to me. Will commit.

Patch applied cleanly to all branches, so no need for special patches. Pushed to the 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 4.x branches, and master.

Thanks István!
