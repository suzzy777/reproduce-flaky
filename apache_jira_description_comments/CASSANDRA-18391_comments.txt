Near as I can tell, this shouldn't be running.  It's decorated max_version='3.99' [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/trunk/upgrade_tests/cql_tests.py#L1538], the doc says "Checks that 3.0 serializes RangeTombstoneLists correctly when communicating with 2.2 nodes", and is indeed skipped when I try to run it.

One thing I noticed that the class name is no longer 'TestCQL' and is instead 'cls', I think from the transition to python 3.8, perhaps due to this inheriting UpgradeTester which inherits from both Tester and the builtin abstract base class. 

This test is being skipped, but the 'since' fixture, when it detects an upgrade, checks if any of the involved versions are excluded and then skips them, but doing this does the ccm setup for the old version first.  If you don't already have this setup done, you can get a really long skip:

bq. 1 skipped in 241.68 seconds

We can skip out on these upgrades faster, like [this|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/commit/4481f86e80f9625bcb1cfc36e1a97028d235b1d0].

Looks good to me. I have verified that the test is still run in [3.0|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2741/workflows/40dcb79f-5178-4736-ba16-bd62ac486870/jobs/32976/artifacts] and [3.11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2740/workflows/a7fa29c9-6b4f-4628-8e89-ebde92b930ac/jobs/32977/artifacts]. Hopefully skipping the ccm setup will help with other timeouts.

Probably we should add a similar skipping of the ccm setup on {{ported_to_in_jvm}}, a few lines below, [here|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/blob/4481f86e80f9625bcb1cfc36e1a97028d235b1d0/conftest.py#L493].

Good call, updated [my branch|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/tree/CASSANDRA-18391] and a [circle precommit|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/951/workflows/40fc731d-0d44-4dd9-838c-fe6d2919c72f].

Looks great. It seems the last CI run doesn't include upgrade dtests, but I guess we can do with the previous run, sinceÂ {{ported_to_in_jvm}} isn't used on upgrade dtests.

bq. ported_to_in_jvm isn't used on upgrade dtests

Indeed that's why I didn't run them.  Thanks for the review, committed.
