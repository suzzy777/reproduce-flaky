The issue here is that we simply don't wait long enough for 3.0 under the circumstances of the test any longer.

I suspect when [this delay|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/service/StorageService.java#L970] was added this test began failing, since combined with the [sleep a bit later|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/service/StorageService.java#L1007] it's just too long for ccm's default on wait_for_binary_proto of 90 seconds.

3.11 is also dangerously close to exceeding it after that addition, so the simplest thing to do is increase it to a safe amount, which I did [here|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/tree/CASSANDRA-17312].  And [here's a circle run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/354/workflows/3822627d-f02a-4eca-b870-997b7818ee95] with it passing repeatedly on 3.0.

Yep common problem and common fix. +1.

Committed, thanks.
