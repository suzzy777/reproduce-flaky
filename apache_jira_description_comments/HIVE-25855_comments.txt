So, this will be going to be 3.1.3..?

I am thinking 3.2.0 but this is not set yet. Open for discussion.

+1 for 3.2.0.

After further discussions, the plan is to release off branch-3.1. Apologies to backtrack on this. The thinking is that branch-3.1 is easier to stabilize than branch-3 at this point. There are 51 test failures after the initial sets of commits. Some seem flaky. Looking into the test.

Hi [~ngangam] 

are we plan to cherry-pick some commits..? can we label the jira's which are planned to cherry-pick ..? what will be tentative plan..? 

 

 thanks.

yes, mostly CVE and security related fixes are being backported. Sure, I can label jiras that are being cherry-picked.

The last run has 38 failures down from over 100 in the previous runs. 
* The avro test failures with CLIDriver tests work fine locally.  
* TestArrowColumnarBatchSerDe test failures work fine locally.
* All tests that are failing with TestMiniSparkOnYarnCliDriver are being ignored. I cannot seem to be able to run time locally. The failures are exactly the same for prior release off this branch
* TestReplicationScenariosAcrossInstances works fine locally.
* All other tests, if any, are either same as prior release or lower priority.


In the latest run, I tried to do a thrift upgrade as well. Running into some additional test failures. Investigating.

can I help somehow?

Hi [~ngangam] thanks for volunteering for this.  May i try to cherry-pick HIVE-25522 (I hit this in Hive 3 actually..), and how can I do this if so?  Thanks again

[~szehon] If you could backport this to branch-3 in the next day or two, I can include it. Otherwise, we can do another release in month or so.

Hi [~ngangam], the JIRA has been backported (via HIVE-25991), if it can still be included.  Thanks

Apache Hive 3.1.3 has been released.
