I added a looper that awaits a specific condition. Not a very elegant solution, but enough for the testcases- and definitely better than sleep.

In the meanwhile I removed all the other sleep conditions in the same testcase to ensure those don't get flaky in the future.

I executed the testcase in maven 100 times and no failure happened.
Let me know what you think and if you need a testcase for the looper as well.

Thanks,
Thomas


any updates? Flaky tests not an issue anymore?

Thanks for the patch [~thomas.jungblut]. Since the build h/w upgrade, test failures have disappeared. For now, I am closing this out as not reproducible.
