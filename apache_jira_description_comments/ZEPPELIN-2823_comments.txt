    [ZEPPELIN-2823] Notebook saved status is wrong if there was a network disconnect or a flaky network.

    ### What is this PR for?
    Notebook content doesn't get saved if there is a flaky network, and at times user's paragraph content also gets lost in this process.
    
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    [Bug Fix]
    
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    * [ZEPPELIN-2823](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2823)
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    Steps to re-produce:
     - create a new notebook
     - in the first paragraph enter text, say "version1"
     - now disconnect the network (say by removing LAN cable)
     - update this paragraph again with text "version2"
     - reconnect network
     - now observe the on the WebSocket reconnect, the content of this paragraph will go back to "version1"
