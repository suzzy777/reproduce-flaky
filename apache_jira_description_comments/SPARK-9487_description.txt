In Python we use `local[4]` for unit tests, while in Scala/Java we use `local[2]` and `local` for some unit tests in SQL, MLLib, and other components. If the operation depends on partition IDs, e.g., random number generator, this will lead to different result in Python and Scala/Java. It would be nice to use the same number in all unit tests.
