The data types used for testing are not collected at single test/suite and it's not clear which types are covered and which not. We should redesign the coverage and cover following

Operations:
 * put

 * putAll

 * remove

 * removeAll

 * get

 * getAll

Data Types both for value and key (if applicable):
 * byte/Byte

 * short/Short

 * int/Integer

 * long/Long

 * float/Float

 * double/Double

 * boolean/Boolean

 * char/String

 * Arrays of primitives (single type)

 * Arrays of Objects (different types)

 * Collections

 * 
 ** List

 * 
 ** Queue

 * 
 ** Set

 * Objects based on:

 * 
 ** primitives only

 * 
 ** primitives + collections

 * 
 ** primitives + collections + nested objects

Persistance mode:
 * in-memory

 * PDS

Cache configurations:
 * atomic/tx/mvcc

 * replication/partitioned

 * TTL/no TTL

 * QueryEntnty

 * Backups=1,2

 * EvictionPolicy

 * writeSynchronizationMode(FULL_SYNC, PRIMARY_SYNC, FULL_ASYNC)

 * onheapCacheEnabled

We should check basic cache operation, basic sql operations as well as cache to jdbc and jdbc to cache operations.
