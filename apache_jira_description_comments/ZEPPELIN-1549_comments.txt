    @minahlee Thank you for your review! I modified more lines you commented, and some trivial placeholder because I think it's better to read. Is it okay?

    Test in SCALA_VER="2.10" SPARK_VER="1.5.2" still fails. I checked its [LOG](https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/168614710/log.txt),
    
    ```bash
    13:50:41,164  INFO org.apache.zeppelin.rest.AbstractTestRestApi:299 - 200 - OK
    13:50:41,164  INFO org.apache.zeppelin.rest.AbstractTestRestApi:140 - Test Zeppelin stared.
    SPARK HOME detected null
    ```
    ```bash
    +cp spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.3.tgz ..
    +cd ..
    +tar zxf spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.3.tgz
    
    gzip: stdin: unexpected end of file
    tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
    tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
    tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
    +echo 'Unable to extract spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.3.tgz'
    Unable to extract spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.3.tgz
    +rm -rf spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.3
    +rm -f spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.3.tgz
    +set +xe
    ```
    
    It seems to be disabled to extract .tgz file, so it can't find Spark Home.
    And I wonder why it's associated with my modification yet.

    @hyonzin Sometimes, CI tests are flaky. Could you re-trigger CI once again and see if it goes to green?

    I doubted CI's test in this PR, so I tried this test for absolutely same code in my own repository. And it shows all green.
    [travis-ci.org/hyonzin/zeppelin/builds/168996633](https://travis-ci.org/hyonzin/zeppelin/builds/168996633)
    I guess all checks are failed in this PR because of cache.
