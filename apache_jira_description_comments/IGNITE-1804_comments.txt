    IGNITE-1804: Reenabled GridCachePartitionedQueueCreateMultiNodeSelfTest.testTx: does not fail since v.2.0.

----


Since this test deals with pessimistic+repeatable_read transaction there is a necessary condition that should be satisfied to pass: "writer" transaction commit (and key unlock) should happen-before subsequent key lock in some concurrent "reader" transaction (see the patch attached). This happens-before condition violations are still flaky but much more reproducible than original bug. Commit [1] fixes both, thus versions >= 2.0 are unaffected. 

[~avinogradov], please accept my PR and unmute this test on TC.

[~andrey-kuznetsov] please attach TC link (screen shot would be useful too) for Data Structures suite with your fix and unmuted tests.
Thanks !

[~zstan], I've updated TC build link attached to this issue, build is in progress right now.

[~andrey-kuznetsov]
Please merge actual master to your branch and provide green ТС run for unmuted tests (NOT RunAll - run only suite contains these tests)

[~avinogradov], all tests are green now, see [TC build|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=971109]. Please unmute the test on TC.

Merged to master, thanks for contribution. 

Please recheck it unmuted now.
