The changes in the fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1319 introduced a bug which makes setting path to keystore and truststore impossible.
The reason seems to be an incorrect use of getString() here
https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1319/files#diff-69b17249ac9d265091d730130d973f4aR282 
and here
https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1319/files#diff-69b17249ac9d265091d730130d973f4aR311

There should be no getString there, just "path" as it is.
