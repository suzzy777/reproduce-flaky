One thing that I am wondering is if it is worth keeping the old perf CLI driver. Let me know what you think.

Before finalizing this case it may be good to decide if we want to keep or delete the old TPC-DS drivers (or better say tests) namely TestTezPerfCliDriver, TestTezPerfConstraintsCliDriver as part of this issue.

A few advantages/disadvantages of keeping the old tests are outlined below.

+Advantages:+
* Better code coverage. Due to differences in stats, and configurations we end up with different plans so potentially we are covering different codepaths.
* The old drivers can be run on local dev environment without the need of installing Docker.

+Disadvantages+
* Maintenance cost. Now for every change in the planner we may need to update the results from three drivers (~300 queries).
* Unrealistic plans. As mentioned previously the table stats are not obtained from a single TPC-DS scale factor so we in some cases we may never see this plans in practice; this can be seen also as a bug that we could possibly fix.
* Test execution time. Obviously running three test suites instead of one is going to take more time and there is nothing that we can do about it.

In case there is disagreement we can keep them for now and postpone the decision in another JIRA. Let me know what you think.

* the description clearly describes that the metastore data is a composition of questionable quality stuff...so we are running our planning tests against some weird metastore content....
* I don't think adding more tests will increase test coverage - in this case we are talking about queries which are already run 2 times already - I've seen people updating q.out's like crazy....so adding an extra 100 q.out-s will not neccessarily increase coverage...
* the independence from having docker setup is a great - the new approach uses docker - but if that's a problem we could try to come up with some other approach - I'm wondering about using an archived derby database with metastore data
* the metastore content lodader approach is quite unfortunate - IIRC once I had to fix up something in the loader once... because I made some changes to the column statistics

I think we should remove the old approach...and run tests against the new; more-realistic schema.




+1 on removing old driver, since the new one fixes issues with the existing one. I do not think having the old one around adds much value and updating all those q files will be a pain.

[~zabetak], [~kgyrtkirk], if this PR is ready to be merged, I think the removal can be done in a follow-up.

Pushed to master, thanks [~zabetak]!

I've reverted the patch for now because it have exposed some issue with our test environment (master builds have stuck)

merged the new changes - resolving again :)
