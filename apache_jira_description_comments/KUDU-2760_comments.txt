When this fails, it appears to fail on key 151 or 201, so perhaps there's a flush boundary interplay?

Also, it may also be an artifact of the scans in the test not picking up the newly written data. AFAICT the scans use {{READ_LATEST}} with {{CLOSEST_REPLICA}}, so it's possible for the scan to land on a follower that's a bit behind the majority and miss some data.

[~acelyc111] since you added these tests not long ago, could you take a look?
