This tests is not flaky but fails 100%.

It seems the issue is that two PRs got merged close to each other and Jenkins passed for each individual PR but in combination the test breaks. Cf. [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8252] and [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8307]

   The `StandbyTaskEOSIntegrationTest` was broken due to the incorrect offset setting in the checkpoint file enforced by https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/6cf27c9c771900baf43cc47f9b010dbf7a86fa22. The fix is to set the offset to a legitimate value even if the topic doesn't exist.

   Relax the requirement that tasks' reported offsetSum is less than the endOffsetSum for those
   tasks. This was surfaced by a test for corrupted tasks, but it can happen with real corrupted
   tasks. Rather than throw an exception on the leader, we now de-prioritize the corrupted task.
   Ideally, that instance will not get assigned the task and the stateDirCleaner will make 
   the problem "go away". If it does get assigned the task, then it will detect the corruption and
   delete the task directory before recovering the entire changelog. Thus, the estimate we provide
   accurately reflects the amount of lag such a corrupted task would have to recover (the whole log).
