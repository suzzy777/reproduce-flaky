I began a preliminary fix before realizing the task was going to be more complicated than expected.  Find attached two diffs, one to remove the 1.5k+ lines of dead code and one to perform basic inspections and removal of unused members and methods.

`dead.diff` must be applied before `inspections.diff` for the latter to apply cleanly.
