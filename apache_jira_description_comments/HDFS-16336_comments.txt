Committed to trunk, branch-3.3, and branch-3.2. Thanks [~KevinWikant] for the report and thanks [~vjasani] for the fix.

looks like the change to GenericTestUtils didn't get included

We have two options for 3.3 and 3.2:
 # We can backport GenericTestUtils new method from HDFS-16171
 # For 3.3 and 3.2 backport patch of this main PR, we can remove last argument "RollingUpgradeStatus is already set" from waitForNullMxBean()'s call to GenericTestUtils.waitFor()

While 1) might not be direct backport and might require PR, 2) should be quite simplified.

[~stevel@apache.org] [~aajisaka] to unblock 3.3 and 3.2 builds quickly, could you please help commit option 2) from the above? Here is the patch:
{code:java}
--- a/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/TestRollingUpgrade.java
+++ b/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/TestRollingUpgrade.java

+    }, 100, 8000);
   }
 
   private static void startRollingUpgrade(Path foo, Path bar, {code}
If you also prefer option 1), I can create backport PRs for HDFS-16171 but in the meantime, above patch will unblock builds for both 3.3 and 3.2.

Thanks

Pushed the Addendum to branch-3.3 & 3.2

Would be good to backport the generic test utils stuff to all other branches. When you get the backport in, may be we can revert the Addendum commit....

 

Thank you [~stevel@apache.org] and [~ayushtkn]. Sorry for breaking branches. I'm trying to backport HDFS-16171.

Thanks [~ayushtkn] for quickly applying the addendum. Thanks [~aajisaka] for help with backports, just saw your comment. Let me create backport PRs for HDFS-16171 to help expedite it?

Backported HDFS-16171 to branch-3.3 and reverted the additional commit from branch-3.3.

Hi [~vjasani] 

Oh, I missed your comment and I've already backported to branch-3.3. Would you create backport PR for branch-3.2?

[~aajisaka] I am fine either ways. If you have backport ready, I can test locally also if you would like. Just tested 3.3, it seems all good.

Edit: my bad, you mentioned about 3.3 backport only. Sure, let me create PR for 3.2 backport. Thanks

Merged the PR for branch-3.2 prepared by [~vjasani] and reverted the additional commit from branch-3.2. Thanks a lot!
