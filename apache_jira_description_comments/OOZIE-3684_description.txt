There was already a commons-lang 2->3 upgrade in scope of OOZIE-3446, but OOZIE-3492 brought it back again to:
 org.apache.oozie.action.hadoop.SparkActionExecutor:
https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/3a932ad1cd7e294576b03c48bbd28e691ad6f58b/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/SparkActionExecutor.java#L22

The goal of this Jira is to change this import to the commons-lang3 version one to make Oozie fully migrated to commons-lang3Â again. 

_NOTE_: the commons-lang 2 version is available via transitive dependency.
