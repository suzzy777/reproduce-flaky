Before HBase-1.2, the Increment TimeRange set on the client was serialized over to the server. As of HBase 1.2, this appears to no longer be true, as my preIncrement coprocessor always gets HConstants.LATEST_TIMESTAMP as the value of increment.getTimeRange().getMax() regardless of what the client has specified.
