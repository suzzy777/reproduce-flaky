http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToCommit should be updated to clearly spell out these committer responsibilities:

1) For non-trivial patches, code reviews must be done by another *committer*.
2) Code reviews follow the checklist (http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/CodeReviewChecklist) so that, among other things, the patch is checked for robust documentation and unit tests 
3) A -1 from Hadoop QA for lack of unit tests *must* be explained satisfactorily by the contributor else the patch *is not* committed. In this case, the manual tests performed by the contributor must be explained.
4) A -1 from Hadoop QA for findbugs, javadoc, or javac warnings means the patch *must not* be committed until these are fixed (else every subsequent patch will get -1 on these)
5) A -1 from Hadoop QA for core *and* contrib unit tests means the patch *must not* be committed until these are fixed (else every subsequent patch will get -1 on these)

Others responsibilities?
