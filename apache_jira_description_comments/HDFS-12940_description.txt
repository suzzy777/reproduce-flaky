{{TestKeySpaceManager#testExpiredOpenKey}} is flaky.

In {{testExpiredOpenKey}} we are opening four keys for writing and wait for them to expire (without committing). Verification/Assertion is done by querying {{MiniOzoneCluster}} and matching the count. Since the {{cluster}} instance of {{MiniOzoneCluster}} is shared between test-cases in {{TestKeySpaceManager}}, we should not rely on the count. The verification should only happen by matching the keyNames and not with the count.
