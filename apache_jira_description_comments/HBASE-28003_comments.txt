This is a failed run

https://nightlies.apache.org/hbase/HBase-Flaky-Tests/master/11601/hbase-server/target/surefire-reports/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ipc.TestSecureNettyRpcServer-output.txt

Seems that, for the failed run, the DN will try to get a ticket for server principal hbase/localhost.localdomain@EXAMPLE.COM, where we will only create principal for hbase/localhost@EXAMPLE.COM

Let me dig more.

I think for the two secure tests, it is an environment problem.

We use localhost in our tests but actually, on hbase11-hbase-19, we have something like this in /etc/hosts

{noformat}
### Hetzner Online GmbH installimage
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
176.9.143.126 jenkins-hbase11.apache.org jenkins-hbase11
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
2a01:4f8:160:215d::2 jenkins-hbase11.apache.org jenkins-hbase11
{noformat}

While in hbase1-hbase10, we have this in /etc/hosts
{noformat}
127.0.0.1 localhost
172.31.19.21 jenkins-hbase1.apache.org jenkins-hbase1
# 44.240.205.17 jenkins-hbase1.apache.org jenkins-hbase1

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
{noformat}

So on hbase11-hbase19, we may use localhost.localdomain as the hostname and finally lead to the failure.

I think a simple way to fix it to change the /etc/hosts file to not include localhost.localdomain...
