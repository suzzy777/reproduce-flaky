Trunk patch to get a test run through, just to be sure.

Also tried with 20m rows, 1 col each, every in cache and filtered at the server. Without patch takes 5.63s, with 5.19s.

I reran TestZKProcedure, TestEncryptionKeyRotation, and TestLogRolling locally. The all pass fine (and in any case they do not seem related).
So if no objection I would like to commit this to all branches. [~apurtell], [~stack].

+1 from me. We can back it out if tests go flaky subsequently. (I'm about to give 0.98 branch another round of 50 suite runs.)

+1 for 0.96

Committed to all branches. Thanks for taking a look.
