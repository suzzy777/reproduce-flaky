[~kuaw26] Can you please review this change? It also changes log4j configs in visor and webconsole, so it would be nice if you have a look.

TC looks good (errors are only on timeout and flaky tests).

[~roman_s] Visor & Web Console looks good for me.

[~kuaw26] Thank you!

[~sboikov] Can you please double-check before I merge?

Looks good to me.

Thanks!
