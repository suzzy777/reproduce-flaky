As per this thread - http://apache-ignite-users.70518.x6.nabble.com/Specifying-location-of-persistent-storage-location-td16636i20.html

Ignite may switch storage path in case of changing DHCP lease or similar which can lead to consistent ID change.

In order to help user in spotting the issue Ignite may output the following to the logs:
# Output the store path and tell its (1) size or state that it is empty and (2) last data file modification date.
# Output warning if there are other non-empty storage folders under work directory with their sizes and dates.
