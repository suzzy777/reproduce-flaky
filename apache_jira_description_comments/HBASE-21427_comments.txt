IIRC it was not easy to do this because of how multi-branch pipelines work in jenkins.

What if we moved this stuff into its own repo, something like {{hbase-ci}}? we could probably remove most of {{dev-support}}. we'd need to refactor things a bit since the job would have to manage what branches are tested itself, but we'd gain the ability to throttle ourselves project wide as opposed to now where it's per-branch.

I went the per-branch route originally because it's what the jenkins docs encourage and it means we automagically have an equivalent amount of testing of new feature branches as the main branch. But I don't think folks are aware of the amount of testing done by default when they make a branch. Centralizing things would flip this around and make folks opt-in to it. We'd need to document that as a part of docs about "how to make a feature branch".

related / not related I agree that nightly should be run once / day. the flaky job though loses a lot of utility if it isn't running very often. By their definition these are tests that we need multiple runs to see failures and multiple parallel runs for catch-up are a feature rather than a bug.
