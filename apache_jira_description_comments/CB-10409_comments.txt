[~sarangan12] Are you still seeing these failures? These look like related to cordova-vm server for filetransfer test not being up.

Yes. I am able to see the same errors today also but on a different build (android-osx). https://ci.apache.org/builders/cordova-android-osx/builds/1577/steps/getting-test-results/logs/stdio. 

From what I see, I think the cause of the issue is that the Asynchronous callback was not invoked within the specified time of DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL (which is 5 seconds) I need to investigate what has happened in these tests that might have pushed the operation more than 5 seconds. I will investigate it. 

This error could not be reproduced locally. All the tests are passing. This might be a genuine timeout error. Working on to increase Jasmine Default timeout. 

I'm noticing this error on cordova-android-osx as well: https://ci.apache.org/builders/cordova-android-osx?numbuilds=35

    CB-10409: Flaky File Transfer Plugins

    This is one of the flaky tests that occurs about 20% of the times in windows store 8.1 platform. But, this has not been reproduced locally. This causes the app to crash. The error message is " Error: Expected a spy, but got Function." Based on the error message, I suspect that the error is related to the issue that the spying is not set correctly on the transfer progress. So, I have modified this code and submitting this for PR.
