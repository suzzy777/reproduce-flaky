A region is flushed if its memory component exceed a threshold (default size is 128MB).
A flush policy decides whether to flush a store by comparing the size of the store to another threshold (that can be configured with hbase.hregion.percolumnfamilyflush.size.lower.bound).
Currently the implementation (in both cases) compares the data size (key-value only) to the threshold where it should compare the heap size (which includes index size, and metadata).
