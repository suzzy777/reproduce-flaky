To reproduce:
- have a 3 nodes ZK ensemble with readonlymode.enabled
- shut down 2 of the 3 ZK servers ( we start in read only mode)

Then create a piece of code (see Test.java attached):
- a curator client (keep the timeout reasonably short)
- a NodeCache listener on '/'
- a separate ZooKeeper client

-> the connection goes into READ_ONLY/ConnectedReadOnly as expected

- start another ZooKeeper

-> the connection goes into SUSPENDED/Disconnected, then CONNECTED/SyncConnected, fine.

- stop one of the 2 ZooKeeper alive

-> the connection goes:

ZOOKEEPER STATE: Disconnected
CURATOR STATE: SUSPENDED
ZOOKEEPER STATE: ConnectedReadOnly
CURATOR STATE: READ_ONLY
CURATOR STATE: SUSPENDED
CURATOR STATE: READ_ONLY
CURATOR STATE: SUSPENDED
CURATOR STATE: READ_ONLY

So it's flaky. Sometimes it doesn't switch back and forth, sometimes twice only, sometimes a lot more.

Depending on the timeout on the client, it might take more time to appear.
I attached a sample code that would reproduce it in 20-30 seconds.

Note that the problem may ultimately be on the ZooKeeper side but at that point I just don't know.
