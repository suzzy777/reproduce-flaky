{color:red}-1{color} Patch failed to apply to head of branch

IIRC, Maven doesn't like non-constant version numbers.  I forget the exact reason why, but I think it was something about it not working right when publishing the artifacts.  In any case, [~shwethags] recently got rid of most of those Xlibs modules with those versions anyway (OOZIE-1876).

Thanks [~rkanter] for quick comments.
So if the version is "4.2.0-SNAPSHOT" , mvn will not publish for some modules. right?

Overall, do you think  we need this patch?
If not, how to handle something like this "mvn version:set newVersion=4.1.0.48"?



Sorry I forgot to upload the latest code. 
Looks like Swetha already removed those files:)

So I can close this JIRA.



I removed hadoop-x and hadoop-test-x, but hadoop-auth-x and hadoop-utils-x still exist. Even I was trying to see if we can use parent version so that release plugin can automatically upgrade versions. But there was some issue, and I don't remember now what it was

[~andras.piros] I think this behavior is already in place with Oozie 5?

[~andras.piros] once I change the version to expression, we get warnings

I'm submitting a new patch with version removed, it will inherit version from parent. Btw, ${project.parent.version} expression also throws a warning.

If it's inherited from the parent pom it will make our lives significantly easier with version bumps.


Can't you just use the maven versions plugin to update the versions as-is?
e.g.
{code}
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=5.1.0
{code}

As for the warning when using an expression, that's been a long-standing issue that Maven doesn't like non-constant versions in poms (other than for dependencies).

[~rkanter] that's why I was wondering if this Jira made any sense at this point, I remember https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE-3097 where I used the mvn versions command to change all child modules. Maybe close this as won't fix?

Yeah, I think we can close this as won't fix.  This was specifically about the repackaging of Hadoop stuff where we had hybrid versions (e.g. {{1.1.1.oozie-4.1.0}}: that is, Hadoop 1.1.1 in Oozie 4.1.0), which we're not doing anymore.  Those versions didn't work with the maven version plugin command.

we can use mvn versions plugin to update versions in sub-modules. 

I still see value in removing superfluous lines here and there.

When we do a rebase in CDH, *every* pom.xml has a conflict in it as we're changing the version from 5.0.0 to something like 5.0.0-cdh6.0.0. It can be resolved easily, but still, it makes things like automated testing more difficult.


Closing issue; Oozie 5.1.0 is released.
