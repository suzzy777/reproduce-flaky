    IGNITE-6442: Bug fixed.

----


Hi, [~agura].  Please, review this issue. [Upsourse|https://reviews.ignite.apache.org/ignite/review/IGNT-CR-346]

I've reproduced the case in which DD is not called and fixed bug. My test method checks only that DD was called, but does not verify that it worked correctly. Because in this case DD works flaky. I'll fix it at [IGNITE-6445|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-6445] and add correctness check to my test method.

It's bad idea to check that deadlock detection procedure was initiated using log messages. In all tests we have expectation about deadlock detection: at least one transaction should detect deadlock. It's enough for tests purposes and more reliable because can't be affected by log message changes. Please, fix it.

And one more comment. It would be better if future will return {{GridNearTxPrepareResponse}} instead of chaining.

[~agura], Done.
I've simplified test and fixed bug in another way that future would return GridNearTxPrepareRespons.

[~agura], after merging this PR, I will remove "TODO" from the test in this ticket [IGNITE-6445|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-6445]. 
Fixes of this 2 tickets are here: [PR_IGNITE-6445|https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/2743] 


[~VitaliyB] Please, don't mix fixes of different tickets. Could you please just update PR for this ticket that will contain fix only this issue? The same should be done for IGNITE-6445.

[~agura], Current  [PR|https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/2699] and [Upsouse|https://reviews.ignite.apache.org/ignite/review/IGNT-CR-346] from issue links.

I've added this PR [PR_IGNITE-6445|https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/2743] to show why I added TODO.


Thanks! Merged to master branch.

JFI: Commit message contains invalid issue number: 6445 instead of 6442.
