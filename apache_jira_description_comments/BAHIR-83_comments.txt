I went back a few more commits to {{a351549}} and rerun the test 100 times with 0 failures.

It looks like before [BAHIR-51: Add new configuration options to MqttStreamSource|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BAHIR-51] this test case run successfully consistently.

Taking a quick look it is not obvious what could be causing it, may be add the test to Ignore for now, incase it is getting in the way of the build system.

[BAHIR-83] temporarily ignore flaky test case "Recovering offset from the last processed offset." in BasicMQTTSourceSuite


[~prashant] I marked the test as ignored so we can go ahead cutting new releases. Do you plan to investigate this further so we can reinstate this test case eventually?
