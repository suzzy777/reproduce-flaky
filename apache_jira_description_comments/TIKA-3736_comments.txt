Failures seem to be limited to Solr8, but we're seeing them on both zk and non-zk.  I don't think I've seen these locally, but we get them fairly frequently in github actions.

This seems to be better now.  I haven't seen any failures since I last commented on this ticket.  We can reopen if these issues return.
