In an HA setup, the standby NN may receive messages from DNs for blocks which the standby NN is not yet aware of. It queues up these messages and replays them when it next reads from the edit log or fails over. On a failover, all of these pending DN messages must be processed successfully in order for the failover to succeed. If one of these pending DN messages refers to a DN storageId that no longer exists (because the DN with that transfer address has been reformatted and has re-registered with the same transfer address) then on transition to active the NN will not be able to process this DN message and will suicide with an error like the following:
