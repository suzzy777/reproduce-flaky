We expect Ozone's test suite to pass before merging code changes.  Tests may be flaky, so we accept a passing run even after failed attempts.  Currently only the complete suite can be repeated, which wastes resources.  I propose to automatically retry failing integration tests (and only the failing ones) a few times in pull requests.
