test-patch.sh currently runs {{mvn test}} in the sub-modules that are changed by the patch.  Due to long-running tests, this can slow down development for certain kinds of patches.  This issue proposes an enhancement to test-patch.sh to support a faster mode of execution that applies the patch and runs {{mvn test -Dtest=...}}.
