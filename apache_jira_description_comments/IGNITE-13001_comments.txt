[~alex_pl] please have a look at Java changes - I've added `ClientComputeTask.KEEP_BINARY_FLAG_MASK`. 
No new feature flags since there were no new releases since Compute addition.

[~ptupitsyn]Â I've got a look. Everything looks good, my only concern is a lack of tests. Please, see my comments.

[~isapego] please re-check, there are 21 total tests, all functionality is covered, including various exceptions (in job, in serialization), including flags, including client disconnect.
See ComputeClientTests and ComputeClientDisabledTests classes.

If you see some missing test case, please let me know.

[~ptupitsyn], I've got a look at java changes. Looks good to me, except some minor issues (see my comments on github).
