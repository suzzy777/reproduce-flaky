Currently, rename is disabled if bootstrap dump in progress. This is achieved by setting a "ACTIVE" flag in database properties which is referred by rename operation. If HiveServer2 crashes when dump in progress, then this flag is not unset (to IDLE state) which make the rename operation disabled for ever. 
User need to manually enable rename in this scenario. So, need to log the property name associated with bootstrap dump which was in progress when HS2 crashes. Using this, user will reset this property of the database to enable rename again.
Also, need document update for the same.
