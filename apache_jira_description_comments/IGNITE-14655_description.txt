Currently, all {{AddData}} methods return a Task, however, this task is not for an individual add/remove operation, but for the current batch.

This is confusing: users often try to {{await}} the returned task, which is natural; but the task will never complete, because the batch is not yet full, and user code is stuck waiting.

* Deprecate {{AddData}}, {{RemoveData}} methods
* Add new {{void Add}} and {{void Remove}} methods
* Add new {{BatchTask}} property to get the task for the current batch
