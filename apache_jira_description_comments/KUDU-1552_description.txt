The ClientTest.TestFailedDnsResolution is flaky.  Sometimes it outputs an error like this:

{noformat}
[ RUN      ] ClientTest.TestFailedDnsResolution
/Users/aserbin/Projects/kudu/src/kudu/client/client-test.cc:1814: Failure
Failed
Expected to find substring 'Network error: Failed to resolve address for TS'. Got: 'Timed out: Failed to write batch of 1 ops to tablet db77badfde3b44efb591c683e6bf4cea after 27 attempt(s): GetTableLocations { table: 'client-testtb', partition-key: (<start>), attempt: 1 } failed: timed out after deadline expired: timed out after deadline expired'
[  FAILED  ] ClientTest.TestFailedDnsResolution (717 ms)
{noformat}

To reproduce, run on MacOS X for some time from the build directory:
{noformat}
while [ true ]; do ./bin/client-test --gtest_filter=ClientTest.TestFailedDnsResolution 2>/dev/null || break; done
{noformat}
