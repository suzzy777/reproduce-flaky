Following synchronizes over local variable rather than the original ProcedureEvent object. Clearly a bug since this code block won't follow exclusion with many of the synchronized methods in ProcedureEvent class.
{code}
 @Override
  public void wakeEvents(final int count, final ProcedureEvent... events) {
    final boolean traceEnabled = LOG.isTraceEnabled();
    schedLock();
    try {
      int waitingCount = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
        final ProcedureEvent event = events[i];
        synchronized (event) {
          if (!event.isReady()) {
{code}
