java.lang.AssertionError: Delete path for topic should exist after deletion.
	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)
	at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:42)
	at kafka.admin.TopicCommandWithAdminClientTest.testTopicDeletion(TopicCommandWithAdminClientTest.scala:471){code}
The verification doesn't look safe since the delete path could have been removed before the test verifies it.
