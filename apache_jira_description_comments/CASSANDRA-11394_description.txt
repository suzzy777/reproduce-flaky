The other nodes fail to notice node5 come up. If we check the logs, they're complaining about long interval times for that node. Might just be an issue with how many nodes we're starting? I don't actually see any errors.

Logs for this failure attached. This is flaky, and has happened on a few bootstrap_multidc_tests

example failure:
