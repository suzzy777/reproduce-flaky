Also related - as in found while working on this ticket - CASSANDRA-14574.

I recommend marking this test as an expected failure until this ticket is fixed. Having tests fail and then ignored causes confusion (See: CASSANDRA-14574, CASSANDRA-13426).
{code}
@xfail("Should be addressed with CASSANDRA-14571")
def test_populate_mv_after_insert_wide_rows(self):{code}
That way the test will still be run and still be included in the report but it wont fail the test suite. This is better than just ignoring dtest run failures.

[~beobal] Pushed the branch [here|https://github.com/iamaleksey/cassandra/commits/14571-4.0].

Had CircleCI run all three jobs multiple times. Examples [here|https://circleci.com/gh/iamaleksey/cassandra/465], [here|https://circleci.com/gh/iamaleksey/cassandra/467], and [here|https://circleci.com/gh/iamaleksey/cassandra/462], and more where it came from.

It's a tiny patch, it makes a best-effort attempt at waiting for schema to converge. If it fails, it just logs. Hard-throwing caused some other MV-related tests to time out occasionally, sadly.

If you can review it (it's really small, I promise) or maybe even commit, with whatever changes you feel necessary, tomorrow - I'll super appreciate it (I'll be away, but trunk dtests never rest and will keep falling until this gets in).

Cheers (:

LGTM, committed to trunk in {{13150b001a8ddf82a77ac9525c446b7e9e32325c}}

Looking at 4.0 test failures this one was failing again. There is still a window for schema agreement to happen but the view not be available yet in some nodes. Marking the flaky test in CASSANDRA-15855 and CASSANDRA-15845 to address that root cause eventually. #justfyi
