org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <1> but was: <0>
	at org.apache.zookeeper.server.persistence.FileTxnSnapLogMetricsTest.testFileTxnSnapLogMetrics(FileTxnSnapLogMetricsTest.java:86)
{code}

This test tries to write some txns to trigger snapshot with remaning txns in txn log. But snapshot taking is asynchronous, thus all txns could be written to snapshot. So in restarting, it is possible that no txns to load after snapshot restored. This will fail assertion.
