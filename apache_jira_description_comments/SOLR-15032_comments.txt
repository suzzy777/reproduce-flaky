Should this test be marked as AwaitsFix, [~mdrob]? Or is this not a race that'd cause flakiness?

Is it observed to be failing? My concern about the race was more theoretical IIRC.

Not at a high rate, but the fucit historic trend shows some small bumps.  Jenkins logs for those are probably all long-gone, so it's hard to say if this was what caused those specifically of course, but...
