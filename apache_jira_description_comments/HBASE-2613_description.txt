Currently we have a weird piece of code in the master that handles region servers that report but that we don't know about. People likely see:

{code}
      LOG.warn("Received report from unknown server -- telling it " +
        "to " + HMsg.CALL_SERVER_STARTUP + ": " + info.getServerName());
{code}

But I never saw that working.correctly, usually the region server will restar-ish and we will likely end up with double assignment.
