I've [disabled the mysql/metastore test for now|https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/34b24d55ade393673424f077b69add43bad9f731]

its strange that this happens so frequently and only for this database type...


Hi [~kgyrtkirk] [~asolimando]Â 
Trying to understand the failure better. Had a few questions to ask
1. Where are the docker images downloaded from? 
2. Where do we specify that repo? Curious to understand why we see *Unable to find image 'mariadb:latest' locally?* I couldn't see any Dockerfiles

Thanks.
