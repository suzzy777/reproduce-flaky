I suppose the easiest thing to do here is to increase the tolerance, but the test can still be flaky after we do that. A better solution is to fix the random seed for the writes so that we can use a small tolerance and avoid all flakiness, but I don't know if that's something we can do with the dtest infrastructure (or how, if we can).

Thanks, [~blambov], I'm looking into setting the seed now. Do you know why this behavior changed?

I am sorry, the seed discussion only applies to compressed versions of the test, which {{default_segment_size_test}} isn't.

I looked at the test and am wondering why it expects an overall size of 60mb for two segments of 32mb each? It appears to error out as it sees 64, which is correct and as expected.

60 (or maybe 62.5 as the test appears to allow for 12 or 13 segments) is correct for {{small_segment_size_test}}.

The compressed version of this test, however, fails as the last segment of the log is smaller. This is also expected-- compressed segments grow as data is added; we probably need to special-case this.

Thank you [~blambov]. I've mentioned you on [a dtest pull request|https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/387]. Could you please review it? I believe I've fixed the first two issues, but I'm not sure I understand the small compressed log corner case well enough to fix that test. Thanks.

I've pushed more changes here: https://github.com/mambocab/cassandra-dtest/commit/9e4af0f9981e8e83a03c73ae3b1452349f30e6d6 and I'm requesting review from Branimir and/or Ariel.

Maybe in 3.0 varint is having an impact? It's had a big impact on sizes in other tests.

The entire test is just to make sure segment size settings work? Looks like it does that to me. +1

It's totally possible that varint is changing things. Not sure.

But yes, that's the point of the test. Thanks for the review.

I've merged the dtest: https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/387

Resolving.

Still happening?
http://cassci.datastax.com/view/trunk/job/trunk_dtest/445/testReport/junit/commitlog_test/TestCommitLog/small_segment_size_test/

Ok, looks like both {{commitlog_test.py:TestCommitLog.small_segment_size_test}} and {{commitlog_test.py:TestCommitLog.stop_failure_policy_test}} flap badly on trunk: http://cassci.datastax.com/view/trunk/job/trunk_dtest/445/testReport/junit/commitlog_test/TestCommitLog/history/

I pushed 2 fixed for that, seems to work well on cassci. I will keep an eyes on the next trunk_dtest runs.
