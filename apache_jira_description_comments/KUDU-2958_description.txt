The {{TestReplicatedTabletWritesWithLeaderElection}} of the {{client-test}} is flaky.  Time to time in ASAN build configuration it fails with the following error:

{noformat}
I0924 20:26:19.869351 14037 client-test.cc:4304] Counting rows...

      Which is: 100

It seems there is implicit assumption in the test about fast propagation of Raft transactions to follower replicas.

I attached the full log of the failed tests scenario.
