The RunnableOnService+Dataflow postsubmit has been a little flaky recently, but started failing 143/143 tests at build #514. [Changes]([https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_RunnableOnService_GoogleCloudDataflow/514]):

Base PAssert on GBK instead of side inputs (commit: 810ffeb2785bf996001c8fadb992410d1f9409c6) — klk / detail
Fix TriggerExampleTest (commit: 77aa0938f75f9f3d18a4fa79a5ffe6159167f4d5) — klk / detail
Switch Spark streaming tests to custom assertions (commit: f222df109e773f23e56f9e830454356893989a15) — klk / detail
Spark runner: Assign windows when re-windowing into global window (commit: d53e96a0d1f5f26ad0e3efc90dc9f7b53135443b) — klk / detail

My best guess is the PAssert change. Kenn, can you please investigate?
