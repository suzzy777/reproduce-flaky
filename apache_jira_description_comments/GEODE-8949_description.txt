This will be our open source CI for publishing to the Apache Software Foundation. Two primary tenets are:
 * based on Concourse
 * PRs will trigger the CI pipeline and can't be merged until they pass the CI

Note: The bulk of this work has been completed in draft [PR #716|http://github.com/apache/geode-native/pull/716]. See that PR for further details.
