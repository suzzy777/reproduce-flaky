the test is @Ignore-ed, and fails being enabled.
Suggested to repair it to fill the coverage gap.

Problems fixed in the test: 
(1) MRConfig.FRAMEWORK_NAME and YarnConfiguration.RM_PRINCIPAL properties must be correctly set in the configuration to correctly enable the security in the way this test implies. 
(2) The property MRJobConfig.MAPREDUCE_JOB_CREDENTIALS_BINARY now is not passed into the Job configuration -- it is intentionally deleted from there. So, we pass the binary file name in another dedicated property. 
(3) The test was using deprecated cluster classes. All them are updated to the modern analogs.
(4) The delegation token found in the job context is now correctly compared to the one deserialized from the binary file.
