    LGTM.
    
    @hanm the build failure was spurious as this was a change to the CMake build.

    @anmolnar I can't for the life of me find which unit test failed in the Jenkins build. It can't be related though, as this just adds `libm` to the link line on FreeBSD in addition to Linux, when using CMake (which the Jenkins build, to my knowledge, does not yet use).

    @dforsyth Can you rebase just to force another build?

    @andschwa The only clue I can see is that `zktest-mt` is failing. It might be flaky. Are you sure it's not related to your change? Are you able to run it locally?


Github user andschwa commented on the issue:

    The change is this:
    
    ```
    -target_link_libraries(hashtable PUBLIC $<$<PLATFORM_ID:Linux>:m>)
    +target_link_libraries(hashtable PUBLIC $<$<OR:$<PLATFORM_ID:Linux>,$<PLATFORM_ID:FreeBSD>>:m>)
    ```
    
    This code is not executed on Jenkins, so I don't see how it could be. I double checked, it's still running the Autotools build, here's a snippet:
    
    ```
         [exec]      [exec] checking that generated files are newer than configure... done
         [exec]      [exec] configure: creating ./config.status

         [exec]      [exec] config.status: executing depfiles commands

    Looks like it came out clean this time.

    Yay @anmolnar the tests were flaky, last CI run was clean.

    @andschwa yeah, I've managed to run it locally fine.
