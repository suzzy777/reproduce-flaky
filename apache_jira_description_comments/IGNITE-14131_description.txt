The root cause of such a problem is growing from assumption that one node can obtain only one class loader per class name. Thus multiple tasks calling with different classloaders leads to huge cache grow in server side and finally leads to oom with jvm metaspace. Additionally we can`t use p2p from multiple threads, for example ignite instance is shared as a spring bean.
