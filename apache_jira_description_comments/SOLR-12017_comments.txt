How is this going to help exactly? This is only going to make tests even *MORE FLAKY*.

Instead, the opposite needs to happen. The solr tests that fail all the time need to have these annotations added so that they stop creating so much useless noise.

This is only for JIRAs that are _fixed_.

And I'll beast each one before checking anything in and only check them in if there are no failures.

SOLR-12017: Remove BadApple and AwaitsFix annotations that link to closed JIRAs

(cherry picked from commit bd3f30b)


I'll be monitoring Hoss' nifty reports and if any of these come back I'll re-annotate them.

Final patch. I beasted each un-annotated suite 120 times last night with no failures. Of course whether that holds in all the different environments remains to be seen.

I commented out the annotations and added a date to when they were commented out on the assumption that if these do re-introduce noise, there should be an obvious timestamp as to _when_ they were removed. The remaining disabled tests failed at least once so they'll remain disabled.

Sorry attached patch here, moved to correct issue.
