YARN-9784 fixed some concurrency related issues in {{TestLeafQueue}}, but not all of them. Occasionally it's still possible to receive an exception from Mockito and the two following stack traces can be observed in the console:

{noformat}
	
	org.mockito.exceptions.misusing.WrongTypeOfReturnValue: 
Integer cannot be returned by isMultiNodePlacementEnabled()
isMultiNodePlacementEnabled() should return boolean
***
If you're unsure why you're getting above error read on.
Due to the nature of the syntax above problem might occur because:
1. This exception *might* occur in wrongly written multi-threaded tests.
   Please refer to Mockito FAQ on limitations of concurrency testing.
2. A spy is stubbed using when(spy.foo()).then() syntax. It is safer to stub spies - 
   - with doReturn|Throw() family of methods. More in javadocs for Mockito.spy() method.

It's probably best to disable ActivitiesManager thread entirely in this test class, there is no need for it.
