I pushed this patch which adds examination of CompactionProgress. Lets see if helps. Pushed on branch-2. Will see how it does before pushing elsewhere.

Fixes this as flakey in branch-2. Pushed on master and branch-2.2 too. Doesn't go to branch-2.1.

Hmm... Much better but still an odd failure.... I see one up on the GCE builds ...
