We have several unit tests and integration tests (e.g. FalconCLIIT and EntityManagerJerseyIT) which fail arbitrarily or only in specific environments. It has been like this for some time  but off late they have become worse. We must fix them on priority. This is the UBER JIRA to fix all flaky tests. Please add a sub task if you see any test failures which are specific to your environment or fail arbitrarily.
