Ping [~stevel@apache.org].  Simple test fix. Noticed while working on another issue

Noticed one more consistent fail in  ITestWasbUriAndConfiguration#testCanonicalServiceName
{code}
// Default getCanonicalServiceName() will try to resolve the host to IP,
      // because the mock container does not exist, this call is expected to fail.
      intercept(IllegalArgumentException.class,
              "java.net.UnknownHostException",
              () -> fs0.getCanonicalServiceName());
{code}
Here the container name is a mock one 'mockContainer'  and account name is mockAccount.blob.core.windows.net
While resolve to IP, the container wont come into picture at all.  And seems there is an account 'mockAccount.blob.core.windows.net' present now as it resolves to an IP.  So this test always fails now. I feel its a flaky test. We rely on a storage account name and assume it wont be present. We can not guarantee that.   Better we can remove this part from test. The test already checks for the getCanonicalServiceName() with conf 'fs.azure.override.canonical.service.name' to true.  
Thoughts [~stevel@apache.org].  May I fix this also as part of this PR?

that's HADOOP-17641
if you want to do a roll-up test fix patch (happy with that), there's also

* HADOOP-17637
* HADOOP-17640


HADOOP-17535 is another test which fails in some developer configs -I've put a PR up there

Thanks. Moved the discuss on ITestWasbUriAndConfiguration to other Jira.
This one will be kept for original issue as in title

BTW, turns out Apache Ranger has been calling hsync all the time to flush data and now fails with S3A (correctly) reporting that attempting to flush data is futile. 

I'd be happy for a roll-up PR here..if you pull in/revise/test the changes I've stuck up along with this then I'm ~still in a position to review the patch so we won't need to seek others

I was checking more on the WASB tests [~stevel@apache.org] these days while working on HADOOP-17643.  I see you mentioned 4 Jiras and out of which 2 are in. May I check the other 2 as separate one item as that is ABFS related. For this test, am dealing with my Blob storage alone.  Will you be able to pull this small test fix in? So I can raise the PR for HADOOP-17643
