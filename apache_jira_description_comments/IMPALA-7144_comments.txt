Let's try to make this test more robust, btw so it can't be broken by innocuous additions.

IMPALA-7144: Re-enable TestDescribeTableResults

This patch makes the TestDescribeTableResults more robust by only
comparing the information that the authorization cares about instead
of comparing all output in DESCRIBE. This change will avoid any unnecessary
changes to AuthorizationTest if HMS updates the DESCRIBE output.

The test is also updated to support standalone execution without relying
on other tests be executed first since it can cause the test to be flaky
especially if the tests in AuthorizationTest are executed in parallel.

Testing:
- Ran all FE tests

Cherry-picks: not for 2.x
