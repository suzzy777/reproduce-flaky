Elasticsearch now has a good Java client that talks to ES via its HTTP API (vs. TransportClient that does not).  It would be good if Zeppelin could use that so that it can talk to ES clusters and services that expose only HTTP API (e.g. http://sematext.com/logsene/ exposes the ES HTTP API, but not the Java one, so one cannot use TransportClient to talk to it)
