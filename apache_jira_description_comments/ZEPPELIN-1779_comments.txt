Based on the timing of this happening as well as examining the output of the travis logs more carefully (For some reason a recent PR suppressed the output from the conda install, which I think is a really bad idea btw), the issue is very likely a result of conda installing matplotlib 2.0.0b1, an old beta version for an upcoming release. We can easily make a hotfix for this by forcing conda to use v.1.5.3 which is known to work with Zeppelin. I think this is a good idea anyway since 2.0.0 has some major changes that could very well break the inline backend until we update it. In the meantime, it seems upstream is aware of this problem.

    [HOTFIX][ZEPPELIN-1779]Flaky test: PySparkInterpreterMatplotlibTest

    ### What is this PR for?
    The matplotlib tests have stalled as a result of conda downloading version 2.0.0b1. While this was an old beta version and the issue has been fixed upstream (https://github.com/conda-forge/matplotlib-feedstock/issues/86), we still have not tested the inline backend for 2.0.0 which will be a release with a lot of major changes, hence this PR should be anyway. I am also partially undoing one of the changes made in #1709 which suppressed the output of the dependency installation from conda. This change was very puzzling to me since dependency info isn't that verbose. I ended up determining the cause of this issue because I reverted this change and was then able to see the dependency versions in the log. I could see suppressing this might being necessary for the R packages in case they aren't cached and a wall of compiler output get printed out, but I see no real justification to mute it for python packages, especially given that they will only be installed for two short profiles.
