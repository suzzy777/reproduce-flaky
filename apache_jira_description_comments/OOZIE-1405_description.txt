The SLA tests keep failing randomly because they rely on Thread.sleep. Would be better to execute all test case scenarios and then assert everything in order from eventQueue to avoid flakey failures.

Similar for time-sensitive TestEventGeneration tests e.g. - org.apache.oozie.event.TestEventGeneration.testCoordinatorActionEvent
