According to the [dashboard|https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-Find-Flaky-Tests/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/report.html] testFailedTxnAsPartOfQuorumLoss is flaky. I've looked at some logs and there are multiple causes of flakiness. One of them is in this line after step 5
{code:java}
Assert.assertEquals(1, outstanding.size());
{code}
For example [this|https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper_branch35_java10/10/artifact/build/test/logs] build of 3.5

I was able to reproduce this particular issue in debug mode and the problem is that 'outstading' map can also have 'closeSession' entries that are expected.

I'll submit a patch to relax this check.
