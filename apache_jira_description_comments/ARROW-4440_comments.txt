Can you please comment what you believe to be wrong? 

I fixed this in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3295

I'm not sure this is fixed, I just rebased my branch from master with ARROW-3846 changes:

https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/builds/22110144/job/0vwcaq06bglgshys

It's very strange as the build logs profess to install flatc

Perhaps it's caused by the use of the common thirdparty install directory. I'll open a PR
