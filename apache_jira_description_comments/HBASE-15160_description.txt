In HBASE-11586 all HDFS op latency sampling code, including fsReadLatency, fsPreadLatency and fsWriteLatency, have been removed. There was some discussion about putting them back in a new JIRA but never happened. According to our experience, these metrics are useful to judge whether issue lies on HDFS when slow request occurs, so we propose to put them back in this JIRA, and add the metrics for monitoring as well.
