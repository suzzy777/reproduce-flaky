I printed the array and it seems that we do not have holes but do have missing entries at the end which could be Ok. Should we update the test?

Fixed as part of SENTRY-1580

Are we seeing the same issue as in SENTRY-1792? The changeID is continuous, but the delta change list misses some entries at the end of the list? SENTRY-1795 saves the new entry with increased changeID, there should have no missing entries.

[~lina.li] No, SENTRY-1792 just ensures that all entries are properly sorted. We didn't see any specific issues without it, but it wasn't clear whether this is always the case. SENTRY-1795 changed the way to handle IDs from auto-increment to manual and introduced the test that started to fail, so this issue addresses fixing the test. The problem is that sometimes even after all the retries, the new ID can't be stored so it is possible that the result may have fewer entries then expected. The fix drops the check for the size of the result and only verifies that there are no holes. It is possible that some updates never make it.
