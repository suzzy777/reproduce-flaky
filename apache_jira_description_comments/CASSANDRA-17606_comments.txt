Marking as duplicate of CASSANDRA-17299 as I noticed the recent failures, the only we have logs for, match in both tickets.

I've got a [branch|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/tree/CASSANDRA-17606] that adds a wait for schema agreement at the end of both schema creation calls, and it has a run in [jenkins|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1705/] and 100 in [circle|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/482/workflows/67c88777-35b9-4931-ac5a-93d6c321aa1a/jobs/5561] passed.  While we don't yet have a way to multiplex a test in Jenkins, in practice I was able to reproduce this before the patch and am unable after, so I don't think this was _just_ an environmental thing.  Regardless, waiting for schema agreement is the correct thing to do and perhaps what [this|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/trunk/upgrade_tests/upgrade_through_versions_test.py#L388] is trying to accomplish.


So this new call raises the wait time from 5 to 15s? Looking at max_schema_agreement_wait and considering the sleep is still there.Â 

Wondering whether we want to remove then the sleep?

Yes, it's at most 15s since it's not blindly sleeping.  As for removing the blind sleep, let's try it: [jenkins|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1706/] and [circle|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/483/workflows/8a852510-8a8e-4c67-9613-159d6c7659d2/jobs/5563] are queued up.

Yup, that's what I meant, at most.

I am not against, just wondering whether it makes sense to make it more clear. Also, it seems 10 was considered reasonable.

Let's see

Waiting for schema agreement is the right thing regardless as Brandon says +1. In fact someday we should add a mandatory flag when issuing a command given how many flaky tests we've hit on these grounds. LGTM +1, let's merge it imo as being part of the upgrade matrix this should be a noisy test and we'll kill a few flakies with one stone :-)

+1

Committed, thanks folks!
