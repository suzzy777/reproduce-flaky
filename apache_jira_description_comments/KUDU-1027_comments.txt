Have seen a couple of these on flaky test dashboard - I think we have a use-after-free bug with major delta compaction.

maybe different -- the mt-tablet-test crash I keep seeing is that RowSetTree holds onto the slices returned by DiskRowSet::GetBounds(), and then major delta compaction ends up freeing them.

[~dralves] - do you recall which test you saw this in?

That's KUDU-777.

This seems rare enough I think we'll have to live with it for first beta release.

Todd to start working on this this week.

seems rare, going to punt to backlog

Haven't seen this in quite some time, let's assume it's fixed (this JIRA doesn't have enough info to repro)
