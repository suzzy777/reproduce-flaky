[~ibzib] Yes, that's true. I'll fix this ASAP.


Error handling bug should be fixed by [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15507.]Â We should be able to see the real error now.

This Jira ticket has a pull request attached to it, but is still open. Did the pull request resolve the issue? If so, could you please mark it resolved? This will help the project have a clear view of its open issues.

The attached PRs only addressed error logging, I'm not sure if the test is still flaky or not.
