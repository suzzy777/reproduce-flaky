In CASSANDRA-18935, what I did was that if transport is turned off while node is up, it will set RPC_READY to "false". Before 18935 was in, if you turned off transport while node was up and transport was on, RPC_READY was not changed to false but it stayed to be "true" for ever.

Clearly, this was wrong, so I fixed that, but when I did that, the code which decides who will be the leader of counter mutation was broken, because that node filtered out all nodes for which RPC_READY is false, which never happened before, because nobody has set it to "false" on turned off transport.

So, we decided to revert this regression in 5.0-rc1 and I was waiting for CEP-21 to be in because I saw it is rewritten there with TODO to filter JOINED nodes.Â 

Hence, we can decouple this logic and fix RPC_READY status finally.
