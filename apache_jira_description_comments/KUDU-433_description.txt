Umbrella JIRA for tracking the remaining work to satisfy fault-tolerance when a machine goes down temporarily (i.e crashes but can be rebooted):
- automatic failure detection and leader election
- support both reads and writes
- proper retries in client to hide most failure scenarios

For the purposes of this JIRA, we're assuming that machines are down for short enough periods of time that they don't need to be re-bootstrapped when they come back up.o
