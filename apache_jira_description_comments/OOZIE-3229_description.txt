Currently we can apply a range of filters on top of {{V2SLAServlet}} that can be used in a rich but undocumented set of ways:
* {{id}}
* {{parent_id}}
* {{event_status}}
* {{app_name}}
* {{nominal_start}}
* {{nominal_end}}

Need to refactor {{V2SLAServlet}} to feature:
* a richer set of {{SLAEvent}}, {{SLARegistration}}, and {{SLASummary}} filtering based on their attributes
* filter options will always be {{AND}}-ed, never {{OR}}-ed to each other
* maintain compatibility with the parameter names and behavior used thus far
* remove {{SLASummaryFilter}} and refactor {{SLASummaryGetForFilterJPAExecutor}} as just another possibility for confusion
* document new functionality with rich use case / example library so that users can leverage
