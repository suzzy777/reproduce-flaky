Current timeout for {{commitLatch}} in test {{TxRollbackAsyncWithPersistenceTest.testRollbackOnTopologyLockPessimistic}} is 10 seconds.

This looks insufficient to make a compelling reason that test failure indicates a problem in the implementation. For example log of this [recent failure at Teamcity|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1970040&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Cache7] suggests that there were just a couple of non-critical delays for a few seconds that made test fail.

Suggest to increase timeout from 10 seconds to 60, so that in case if test fails waiting on the latch one could assume with reasonable certainty that something is wrong with the implementation or infrastructure.
