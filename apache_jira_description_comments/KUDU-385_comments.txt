Seems in some cases that the consensus peers heartbeat retry thing just doesn't work, though not clear exactly why. I'm able to repro locally by running 20 copies of the test in parallel with gtest_repeat=100

not sure if this is flaky anymore, but given we track flaky tests on the flaky test dashboard these days, we won't forget about it if it is.
