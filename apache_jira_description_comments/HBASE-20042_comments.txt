I pushed .001 to branch-2 and master. Lets see if it helps.

First patch did not work. It just failed on flakies dashboard. https://builds.apache.org/job/HBASE-Flaky-Tests-branch2.0/2481/  It avoided null region but then the subsequent test that the region had aborted failed because we'd done a servercrashprocedure in the meantime...   I pushed the ADDENDUM that reorders statements so we have a Region to before we kill the RegionServer. Pushed it to master and branch-2.
