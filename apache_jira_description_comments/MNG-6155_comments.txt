I wonder is this a Java 8 test execution order thing where the HTTP tests run first, everything is fine... where they run second, it all blows up

Hmmm so

* https://builds.apache.org/job/maven-jenkinsfile/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/execution/node/139/log/ was on windows and java 7
* https://builds.apache.org/job/maven-jenkinsfile/job/MNG-5629/lastSuccessfulBuild/execution/node/124/log/ on windows and java 7
* https://builds.apache.org/job/maven-jenkinsfile/job/MNG-5629/lastSuccessfulBuild/execution/node/123/log/ on windows and java 8
* https://builds.apache.org/job/maven-jenkinsfile/job/MNG-5958/1/execution/node/140/log/ on windows and java 8

So it is unlikely to be test order changes on Java 8 as half of the failures I inspected were on Java 7

I have not found a failure on linux... so seems to be a flaky test on windows only
