To get currently running coordinator and id, one user had to do
http://localhost:11000/oozie/v1/jobs?jobtype=coord&filter=user%3satish_1.0%3B&offset=1&len=3000
They could not use name in the filter as they include a version and keep changing. For eg:
urs_satish_filter-0.1-daily-coord
urs_puru_service-0.4-hourly-coord
It would be good to have last modified filter to get recently active coordinators.
