https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13103 adds support for setting a normalization flag per {{HTableDescriptor}}, along with the server side chore to do the work.

What is lacking is to easily set this from the shell, right now you need to use the Java API to modify the descriptor. This issue is to add the flag as a known attribute key and/or other means to toggle this per table.
