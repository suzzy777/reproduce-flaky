[~hachikuji] Could I take over this jira?

Hey [~chia7712], I think [~hachikuji] probably missed your message. I am sure [~hachikuji] (and myself) is happy for your to help take this JIRA.

The test calls `AdminUtils.addPartitions` to add partition to the topic after the async topic deletion is triggered. It assumes that the topic deletion is not completed when `AdminUtils.addPartitions` is executed but this is not guaranteed. This is the root cause of the test failure. So it does not indicate any bug in the code and thus this is not a blocking issue for 2.1.0 release.
