GEODE-5746: deflakify cli integration test2 (#380)

- Refactor C# test framework to look like C++ framework
- Pay attention to gfsh exit codes and fail on non-zero exit
- Ensure all tests create their own jmx manager, and test exit gets rid of all java instances
- verify all tests run properly in parallel

Fixed in the linked PRs.Â  If we still have test framework issues (and we probably do), we'll open new tickets as appropriate
