I have done some local testing and suspect that this is not an issue any more. It looks like that the marks of vnode and flaky can be removed.

[~aweisberg] if you don't mind, I will assign the ticket to me and will run this test without vnodes on CircleCI to see if it is not the issue any more. Let me know if you prefer to keep this ticket on you, or you have comments to add to the ticket. Thank you.

Hey [~k-rus], thank you for picking this one!

As you mentioned CircleCI and flakiness, just wanted to bring your attention to the point we have multiplexer jobs in CircleCI now that can be used to run a test in a loop and ensure no flakiness. Excuse me if you already knew about it and I am just making noise. ;) 

[~e.dimitrova] Thank you for brining it. I heard about it but haven't tried. So I am not fully sure how it works. If it will be enough just to enabled repeated_dtest in CI or do I need to do additional adjustments for the number of runs.

Example usages can be found [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/.circleci/config-2_1.yml#L39-L91]

About number of repetitions - I would say we normally use our own judgement based on experience.

For more complicated tests I normally raise the repetitions. You can also set the job to [stop|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/.circleci/config-2_1.yml#L70] in case of failure if you want to.  

Please feel free to ping me if you are unsure or have issues to run the job. Thank you

Thanks [~k-rus].

The patch seems fine and the test seems stable on trunk with no vnodes.

In regards to testing, I am thinking of two things here:

1) The flaky mark is for running with vnodes if I understand correctly. I think you checked it only without vnodes.

2) I think this test is ran also with other cassandra versions so if we do any modifications we need to be sure that it works fine with all affected branches. 

Thank you. I will test flakiness with vnodes and different versions. Am I correct that I need for each case create new commit for CircleCI?

Thank you :)

That's correct. By default you test with no vnodes, to change that you need to apply the change [here.|https://github.com/k-rus/cassandra/blob/c862a8fc5dfc33a72dc709ee5b4c43c8297b44f3/.circleci/config-2_1.yml#L66]

[~e.dimitrova] I run builds on trunk and on Cassandra 3.0 branches with and without vnodes. Is it enough? Or do you expect me to run on 3.11 and 4.0 branches?

We need to run the tests at least once per affected branch or I would probably do it just a few times on the other branches, or at least 3.11 more than one test run. Depends on how much the code in that area diverged between the different versions. 

Also, we need second reviewer, [~brandon.williams], do you mind to look at this too?

We should test all the branches to be proactive, imo.  With 4.0 in the unicorn green state right now, I'd hate to discover a gotcha after committing.  I'm happy to review.

[~e.dimitrova] [~brandon.williams] I am working on to push branches with commits to CircleCI for 3.11 and 4.0 with and without vnodes.

[~e.dimitrova][~brandon.williams] to my understanding the test, which I enabled, was successfully executed as repeated on all Cassandra branches with and without vnodes.

I may have missed it, but I don't see a 4.0 w/vnodes run?

It seems those were added in the latest edit of this comment.

The results look good to me. +1 Thank you!

ah, my comment preceded that.  +1

Thanks, I will commit it soon 

Committed, thanks!
