I'll take a deeper look but it looks like two unrelated tests that had issues when trying to create directories.
Let's leave this open for a few more days to see if this repeats, currently it just seems like there was an issue with the disk, and it's not recurring. 



[~dhalperi@google.com] There were no weird test failures since, and non at all in the past couple of weeks. Can we close this one ?

Thanks!

Sorry I blocked you -- next time, feel free to close it yourself.
