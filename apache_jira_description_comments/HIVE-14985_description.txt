When I tried to run llap_udf.q repeatedly from my IDE then the first run was a pass, but following runs were failed. 

The query does not remove the created functions in the query file which could cause problems for the follow up tests.

The same problem could happen if a query test fails in the middle of the script, and even though the file contains the removal sql commands, those are not executed.

It might be a good idea to clean up not just tables and keys, but functions created during the test run.
