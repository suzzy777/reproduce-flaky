failing tests pass locally, [~gezapeti] please review

I'm not familiar with these options. Won't this hide useful information from time to time?

[~dbist13] thanks for the contribution!

I share [~gezapeti]'s concerns about shadowing more important dependency warnings.

What about one of the following instead:
* exclude {{com.sun:tools}} where applicable
{noformat}
            <exclusion>
                <artifactId>tools</artifactId>
                <groupId>com.sun</groupId>
            </exclusion>
{noformat}
* explicitly state the {{<systemPath />}} of {{com.sun:tools}} dependency where applicable:
{noformat}
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.sun</groupId>
   <artifactId>tools</artifactId>
   <scope>system</scope>
   <systemPath>${JAVA_HOME}/lib/tools.jar</systemPath>
 </dependency>
{noformat}

[~andras.piros] and [~gezapeti] thanks for your mentorship, the exclusion worked, the other option didn't. I don't see a message with the attached patch.
