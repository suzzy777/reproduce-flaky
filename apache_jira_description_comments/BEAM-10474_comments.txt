This flake is at ~44% failure rate on beam_PreCommit_Python_Cron:

I believe this is caused by the fix to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10007. https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12288 _should_ fix this. I tested the change, but I do not know if it is still flaky.

Sorry about this. Looks like it was resolved by #12288: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Cron/3001/testReport/junit/apache_beam.transforms.display_test/DisplayDataTest/test_value_provider_display_data/history/
