IntegrationTestReplication has been flaky for me on pre-1.1 versions of HBase because of not-actually-synchronous operations in HBaseAdmin/Admin, which hamper its setupTablesAndReplication method. To get around this, I'd like to add a \-nrs/--noReplicationSetup option to the test to allow it to be run on clusters in which the necessary tables and replication have already been setup.
