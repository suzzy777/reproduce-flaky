Good investigative work, [~psomogyi]!

Short term I think we should apply this fix to our dockerfile, but longer term [~misty] recently suggested that we should probably start with {{FROM maven:3.5.0-jdk-8}}.

That's going to move us from ubuntu to Oracle Linux, because it's based on the [official jdk8 image|https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OpenJDK/java-8/Dockerfile] - so it's probably some non-zero dev effort, but the simplification and not having to fight the downloader every time our version breaks will likely be worth it.

I believe there is another option is to use openJDK. The PPA installer failed on JDK7 once in the past IIRC.

Yea, I've been learning how Docker works in general and when I started asking questions about our current 90-step Dockerfile, Misty made a new one for me to play with that is much shorter and appears to be working so far. It's based on the maven:3.5.0-jdk-8 image mentioned above, which is in turn based on openjdk. I think we should switch to it, the research I've done indicates that OpenJDK and Oracle JDK only differ in the non-free extra add-ons that Oracle adds, which we don't use anyway here (stuff like Flight Recorder and Mission Control)

[~misty] - can you attach the file that you made, since I'm not sure of the license and copyright status of it and wouldn't feel comfortable posting it myself. 

It is definitely possible that this could be improved, but here's a start.

Does installing multiple jdks work on the official image? We need jdk7 and jdk8 for branches-1*

Worth noting that this would also change our maven version, I think?

bq. Does installing multiple jdks work on the official image? We need jdk7 and jdk8 for branches-1*
Will investigate. It probably does, but might require some gymnastics. Will still be tone simpler than what we have currently, I imagine.
bq. Worth noting that this would also change our maven version, I think?
Nope, we're on 3.5

It actually intentionally pegs the Maven version, and you'd need to change the {{FROM}} line to move to a different Maven version.

Attaching your work as a patch so that precommit can run it. Thanks, [~misty]!

Let's change to use openjdk 8 first to fix the pre commit? We can open another issue to simplify the docker image. [~mdrob]

Thanks.

Sounds good. If it worked the first time I would have said to make the big jump, but since it didn't let's get the quick fix in. [~Apache9] [~psomogyi] do either of you want to take this over and put up a patch? It is getting pretty late in my timezone, but I will be happy to review anything in the morning.

Switch to use openjdk8.

Let's see whether the pre commit job can build a docker image successfully and also the mvn install. If it works then I will upload patches for other branches.

Thanks.

+1 on master patch pending QA, [~Apache9]

[~Apache9], in the previous run there was another error as well but the build did not fail there. Do you think it is critical?
We might need to install wheel module as well.

OK we failed at the same place... Need to dig into yetus...

Let me commit the v12 patch first. At least the docker image is built...

[~busbey] Seems this failure came before the oracle jdk8 problem. See this build:

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/9169/consoleFull

I tried to commit v12 first and then run pre commit, the name of the base image and patch image are all changed, but the build still failed...

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/9213/console

Any ideas on this?

Thanks.

okay, the precommit job now has an additional parameter of where to pull a pre-release yetus version from. I have a fork of yetus on github that echo's the exec'ed command before doing it.

after all of that the failure is:

[~mdrob] and I are working on the theory that this whole section here is wrong:

got it!

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/9234/console is running actual tests now.

I'll start another build that just uses the yetus release bits to confirm. but it looks like the failure _was_ caused by my altering the job to pass in MAVEN_OPTS and then not doing enough to revert that change. the relevant problem area is this one:

{code}
"--env=EXCLUDE_TESTS_URL=https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/excludes/" 
{code}

the quote starting that parameter apparently makes the docker command treat it as the image name.

That particular parameter gets into Yetus via DOCKER_EXTRAARGS, so I altered the job to not include the quotes when setting it.

Re-executing against the patched versions to perform further tests.

9235 is the run that's using the normal yetus release we use. having trouble with asf jenkins getting me the console so I can see if it's progressing.

I'm able to get to the console and it looks like it's running fine. It's gotten past at least maven install at this point.

+1 to Duo's patch, and then let's file a follow-on JIRA to get Misty's improvements in with less time pressure.

This needs to go to master and branch-2? I haven't looked at if branch-1 builds are broken because of this or not.

sounds goods to me. Presuming it is an unreasonable hour in Duo's locale want to go ahead with things [~mdrob]?

Great digging here folks!

the patch as it is needs to go to master and branch-2. branch-1.1 is probably fine. the rest of the branches-1 are probably broken on jdk8 installation, but also need jdk7, so will look different.

We shouldn't be checking against hadoop 2.4 and hadoop 2.5 on master... [~busbey] - any idea what triggered it in your job?

that sounds like it didn't properly find the personality when setting up docker.  the [yetus provided example for hbase|https://github.com/apache/yetus/blob/rel/0.5.0/precommit/personality/hbase.sh#L36] has the out of date hadoop version checking.

oh, that was 9234 and it didn't actually use our personality. let's wait for 9235 to finish then.

to be safe, we could commit the change to a branch and then refresh the nightly view to pick it up and run through all the plugins.

FYI, every personality shows up as {{/testptch/patchprocess/precommit/personality/provided.sh}} when run in docker mode, because we copy it to that location.

bq. FYI, every personality shows up as /testptch/patchprocess/precommit/personality/provided.sh when run in docker mode, because we copy it to that location.

It doesn't do that here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14093?focusedCommentId=16204463&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16204463

huh. okay, must be a difference between how we and hadoop do our yetus invocations.

Saw the build finish, thanks for working on this everybody!

I think we have the same problem for branch-1,  see 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-18090?focusedCommentId=16210533&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16210533

Need a patch for branch-1 ?
