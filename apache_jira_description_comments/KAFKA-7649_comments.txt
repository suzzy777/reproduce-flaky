The there is error in the log that says "No JAAS configuration section named 'Client' was found in specified JAAS configuration file: '/tmp/kafka7346315539242944484.tmp'. Will continue connection to Zookeeper server without SASL authentication, if Zookeeper server allows it. (org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn:1011)". The source code confirms that broker will fail to start with "java.lang.SecurityException: zookeeper.set.acl is true, but the verification of the JAAS login file failed." if broker can not find JAAS configuration file.

So the question is why broker fails to find the JAAS configuration file even though "startSasl(jaasSections(kafkaServerSaslMechanisms, Option(kafkaClientSaslMechanism), Both))" in SaslEndToEndAuthorizationTest.setUp() should have created the JAAS configuration file. I could not find the root cause yet. 

Since this happens rarely in the integration test and this issue is related to the existing of a configuration file during broker initialization. My guess is that the bug is related to the test setup, or maybe the temporary file `'/tmp/kafka7346315539242944484.tmp` is somehow cleaned up by the test machine. Though I am not 100% sure, my opinion is that this is not a blocking issue for 2.1.0 release.
