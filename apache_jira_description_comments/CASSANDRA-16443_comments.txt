The problem is a timestamp issue. If the {{localDeletion}} of the deleted partition is the same as the {{localDeletion}} time of the deleted row they will be merged together and will not appear in the result that will be {{[Row[info=[ts=11] ]: c=1 | [v=1 ts=11]]}}. If the {{localDeletion}} times are not the same (which happen when the queries will not be executed within the same second) the deletions will not be merged and the result will show the row deletion.

I checked 3.11 and the test does not exist there. 

Indeed, the test was non-deterministic. I slowed down my machine significantly and I was able to immediately reproduce the described problem. Now the test is deterministic and I also looped the test, thank you!  +1, I suggested only the usage of one of the utility functions. I believe this could be done on commit if [~Bereng] doesn't have anything else that he wants to be addressed.

I don't have any comments. LGTM. I am just struggling to find where the operations within the same second get/don't get merged together. [~e.dimitrova] pointed me [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/5ed5e84613ef0e9664a774493db7d2604e3596e0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/rows/RowAndDeletionMergeIterator.java#L179] but I still can't see where the 'seconds' resolution come into play...

Ok I _think_ this might be bc {{localDeletionTime}} has a resolution of seconds. Hence {{AtomicBTreePartition.addAllWithSizeDeltaInternal() -> add() -> add() -> superseeds()}} would merge/not merge on a seconds resolution.

[~Bereng] when I pointed you there I was responding to a different question but I believe we cleared the topic on Slack. Yes, the merge happens on a per second resolution. Please let me know if there are any additional questions I can try to help with.
