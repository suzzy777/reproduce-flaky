This patch fixes both the standard git example and the fluent job git example.

If someone wants to execute the examples multiple times, it is necessary to delete the output directory between executions. Maybe a cleanup should also be added to the workflows.

The second patch adds a {{<prepare>}} block with a {{<delete>}} to the examples. This fixes the basic git example, but the same fix does not work for the fluentjob api git example.

Fluentjob generates an XML like this:
{noformat}
...
<git:git>
    <git:resource-manager>${resourceManager}</git:resource-manager>
    <git:name-node>${nameNode}</git:name-node>
    <git:prepare>
        <git:delete path="${nameNode}/user/${wf:user()}/${examplesRoot}/output-data/git/oozie"/>
    </git:prepare>
    <git:git-uri>https://github.com/apache/oozie</git:git-uri>
    <git:destination-uri>${nameNode}/user/${wf:user()}/${examplesRoot}/output-data/git/oozie</git:destination-uri>
</git:git>
{noformat}
Deletion does not work for this XML, the relevant warning is the following:
{noformat}
Starting the execution of prepare actions
Warning: unknown prepare operation git:delete -- skipping
Completed the execution of prepare actions successfully
{noformat}

Attached patch {{003}} that fixes the previous problem with {{<prepare>}} nodes when there was a prefix inside any of the child nodes, like {{<git:delete>}}. This was an error for all the action types where we put a prefix, like any of the Fluent Job generated {{<prepare>}} nodes.

{{TestPrepareActionsHandler}} covers the new functionality.
