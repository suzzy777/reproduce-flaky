Relative to {{RingMessageWorker.sendMessageAcrossRing}} implementation.

{{IgniteSpiOperationTimeoutHelper}} reinitialized every time the socket successfully connected.

If any of {{IOException, IgniteCheckedException}} occurs upon message send the socket will be closed and old {{IgniteSpiOperationTimeoutHelper}} will be used to reconnect.

But after successful reconnect the new one will be created and the cycle repeat. With a permanent send message error this causes an infinite loop.

The only send error which may cause to exit out of the loop and the next node failure is {{IgniteSpiOperationTimeoutException, SocketTimeoutException, SocketException}}.
