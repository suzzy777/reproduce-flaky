Currently, the Apache Beam Elasticsearch sink is [using|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/elasticsearch/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/elasticsearch/ElasticsearchIO.java#L1532] the [index|https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html#bulk-api-request-body] bulk API operation to add data to the target index. When using append-only indices it is better to use the [create|https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html#bulk-api-request-body] operation. This also applies to new append-only indexes, like [data streams|https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/use-a-data-stream.html#add-documents-to-a-data-stream].

The scope of this improvement is to add a new boolean configuration option, {{append-only}}, to the Elasticsearch sink, with a default value of {{false}} (to keep the current behaivour) that when enabled makes it use the {{create}} operation instead of the {{index}} one when sending data.
