For the patch for IMPALA-5054, we realized that we needed to make the kudu::rpc::Messenger configurable. A patch was done on the Kudu side which is tracked by KUDU-2228. As part of that patch, one of the design decisions taken was to only allow kerberos either on or off for the entirety of the process life. This means that we cannot switch kerberos on and off in the same process any more with KRPC.

 

This makes the testing a little more complicated since we use a Gtest switch to switch between kerberos and plain SASL.

 

A fix for this is to split out kerberized testing from rpc-mgr-test into a new file and keep all the common code in rpc-mgr-test-base.
