TestCachedStoreUpdateUsingEvents seems to use "file:/tmp" as the table and database directory. The cleanUp method will clean all the sub-directories directories in /tmp which can be error prone.

Also noticed that I see a lot NPEs from {{SharedCache#getMemorySizeEstimator}} because the {{sizeEstimators}} field is null. We should add a null check for that field.
