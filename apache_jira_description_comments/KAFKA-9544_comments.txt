   There is a race condition with the backoff sleep in the test case and setting the next allowed send time in the AdminClient. To fix it, we allow the test case to do the backoff sleep multiple times if needed.
   
   This was fairly easy to reproduce prior to this fix. With the fix, I could not reproduce the problem after 500 runs.
