The patch has been reverted. Please see the discussion on the mailing list. The SSH plugin is unavailable right now so we can not transfer data to nightlies. Will come back once it is available.

I disabled these builds on ci-hbase while we wait.

Gavin said the ssh transfer plugin is ready.

Will reapply the PR here and try again.

The work is done.

Thanks all for helping!
