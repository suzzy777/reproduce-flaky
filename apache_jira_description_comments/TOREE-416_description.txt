When running tests in gradle, KernelInputStreamSpec is flaky. Calls to the InputStream.read method hang forever. Sleeping for ~100ms at the end of the before block seems to avoid the problem. The likely cause is an actor thread or ZMQ consumer that needs to start up before running tests, or messages get lost.
