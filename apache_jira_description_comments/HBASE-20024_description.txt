This is a follow-on from HBASE-20015. Root issue is that merge does not support rollback once it has hit the point-of-no-return; it can only roll-forward at this point.

HBASE-18018 added abort to all procedures. HBASE-18016 added ignoring abort to the truncate procedure to get around flakeyness. HBASE-20022 is a new issue to figure what to do w/ unabortable procedures.

Meantime, merge and split have PONR and the procedure executor test harness does abort regardless making these tests flakies. Adding an ignore of the abort once into the PONR makes sense (Always? HBASE-20022 is for those as yet unknown cases where it does not). Let me ignore to merge and split in this issue to address flakeyness.
