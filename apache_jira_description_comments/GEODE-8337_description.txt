As a follow-on to GEODE-8240 and GEODE-8330, this is the final ticket, to rename:

{{Version}} -> {{KnownVersion}}
{{VersionOrdinal}} -> {{Version}}

With this ticket, the work started in GEODE-8240 is complete.

After this change, the versioning hierarchy will be:

Before this change, the hierarchy was:

As part of this story we'll also harmonize version access methods on MemberIdentifier, InternalDistributedMember, and GMSMemberData:

getVersionOrdinalObject() becomes getVersion()

On GMSMemberData:

setVersionObjectForTest() becomes setVersionForTest()
