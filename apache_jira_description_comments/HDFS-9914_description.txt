Webhdfs specific read/connect timeout as added HDFS-9887. This ticket is opened to fix the following issues in current implementation:

1. The webhdfs read/connect timeout should not affect connection for other callers of URLConnectionFactory.newSslConnConfigurator() such as QuorumJournalManager#QuorumJournalManger(), DFSck#DFSck() and TransferFsImage()

2. URLConnectionFactory#getSSLConnectionConfiguration() should honor webhdfs connect/read timeout even if any exception is thrown during customized SSL configuration. 
 
3.  OAuth2 webhdfs connection should honor the webhdfs connect/read timeout.
