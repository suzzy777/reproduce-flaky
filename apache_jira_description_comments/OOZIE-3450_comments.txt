I have managed to reduce to number of jars on the git sharelib (9) with better chosen dependency scopes, but unfortunately I could not find an environment to run the examples code. [~asalamon74] could you please help to check what happens if we keep the below jars only? I upload a patch as well, but these are really minor changes in code.

{noformat}
find share/lib/git -name "*.jar" | sort
share/lib/git/JavaEWAH-1.1.6.jar
share/lib/git/commons-lang3-3.3.2.jar
share/lib/git/httpclient-4.3.6.jar
share/lib/git/httpcore-4.3.3.jar
share/lib/git/jsch-0.1.54.jar
share/lib/git/jzlib-1.1.1.jar
share/lib/git/oozie-sharelib-git-5.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Thanks [~matijhs]. I assigned the Jira to you and changed the status to patch available so precommit will execute the tests. I'll also test it using the git example.

I tried to run the git example, but it fails with the following error:

I think we need the oozie-core jar on the sharelib. Or maybe it would be possible to refactor the code and avoid referring to {{GitActionExecutor$ActionConfVerifier}}.

Thanks [~asalamon74] for the testing.

Could you please give the new patch a try as well? 
Interesting that each of the sharelib projects are using the oozie-core as a provided dependency, the only difference is that while most of them just reffering to static constants in the ActionExecutor-s, sharelib-git's GitMain tries to call a method in GitActionExecutor$ActionConfVerifier. This method is the ActionConfVerifier#checkAndGetTrimmed, which only returns an action conf value, not connecting strongly anywhere, so I moved it to the GitMain class.

I was able to execute the git test successfully.

Thanks for the contribution, +1, committed to master.

Closing issue; Oozie 5.2.0 is released
