Possible culprit, based on timing of when the errors started to happen: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14795/. Not sure why that would trigger the errors though.

(saw this commit from beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_cron/4327/) 

Maybe https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14460? this was the only commit in beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_cron/4326/


So far there are 2 proposed fix options:
https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15104
https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15101

Brian will be out of office for a while. Folks on those PRs [~tvalentyn] [~udim] [~benglez] [~tysonjh] - Could you please pick any of ot the work arounds and go with it?

Disabling the flaky tests in the meantime could also be a good option until we figure out a more permanent solution.

I'm running the python precommit again on the rollback PR. My vote is to rollback if it passes again, that will be 4 runs passing withoutÂ [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14460?].

I looked at https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14460. I would prefer not to revert that PR. It seems like it is adding a useful functionality and there is no explanation how that pr could affect the display_data test. It seems that we have some esotric bug hiding in our test setup or in one of the tests, and it is not great to let this bug prevent contributions to Beam. 

As a possible measure to alleviate the pain, we could add a retry decorator to the offending test, that may silence the error, but also not a good status quo, ideally we should understand what is happening here as it may come up again.

If reverting the PR shows that the tests passes, we could try to bisect what part of PR (likely one of the tests?) triggers this behavior, perhaps it would give some clues. 

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15115 reverted https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14460. However this did not resolve the problem. The test is still flaky (e.g. https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Phrase/2664/)

I think we need to sickbay this test (test_display_data) and then we can undo the reverting of https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14460



The test is sickbayed. Remaining work is to unflake it and remove it from the sickbay.
