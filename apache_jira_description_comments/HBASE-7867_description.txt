setupTestEnv() just sets 100 bytes not 100k bytes
{code}
private static void setupTestEnv() {
// / XXX: From o.a.zk.t.ClientBaseprivate static void setupTestEnv() {
// during the tests we run with 100K prealloc in the logs.
// on windows systems prealloc of 64M was seen to take ~15seconds
// resulting in test failure (client timeout on first session).
// set env and directly in order to handle static init/gc issues
  System.setProperty("zookeeper.preAllocSize", "100");
  FileTxnLog.setPreallocSize(100);
}
{code}

to reduce too many call padLogFile(), I think 100k is correct.
