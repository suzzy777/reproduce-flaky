While testing https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-23354 special_character_in_tabnames_quotes_1 failed. Searching for the test, it seems other patches have also had failures. I noticed that special_character_in_tabnames_1 and special_character_in_tabnames_quotes_1 use the same database/table names. I suspect this is responsible for some of the flakiness.
