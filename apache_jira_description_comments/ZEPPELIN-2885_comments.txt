    [ZEPPELIN-2885] Have Logger subclass StringIO and override write method

    ### What is this PR for?
    H2O python module uses the `isatty` method when outputting to stdout. As Zeppelin replaces stdout with a custom Logger class, the lack of this method causes H2O to fail with most operations.
    
    Subclassing StringIO and overriding the write method fixes this ensures other behavior in the TextIO classes used for stdout is present as well, obviating the need to keep adding method stubs to workaround other modules in the future.
    
    
    ### What type of PR is it?

    ### Todos
    * [ ] - Does `reset` still need to be present?
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    * https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2885
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    * Python/Pyspark interpreter output still works
    * Running the following paragraph should return `False`
    
    ```
    %python
    import sys
    sys.stdout.isatty()
    ```

    * Is there breaking changes for older versions?		No
    * Does this needs documentation?      			No

    As it turns out, we do need to inherit from `object` in order to keep the class a new-style python class in python 2. I had mistakenly thought `StringIO.StringIO` was a new-style class, but turns out it is not.
    
    There was another python2 problem I came across (`StringIO.StringIO` is missing the `encoding` attribute, which was needed).
    
    I had attempted to have `Logger` extend `TextIOWrapper`, but this caused a lot of problems with python2's byte-based `str` class, and extending `BytesIO` caused problems in python3 due to their unicode-based strings.

    @sctincman could you try restart a failed CI build job? https://travis-ci.org/sctincman/zeppelin/jobs/270477925 I think it's flaky test but just in case.

    thanks we definitely need it to work for python 2 and 3.
    could you also look into adding some tests - i think we have interpreter tests for python

    @Leemoonsoo Done. Appears a few of the tests were timing out?
    @felixcheung Can do :]

    Checked tests are green. Is this one good to go?


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2555
  
    think we should have some tests for this

    @sctincman Did you find a workaround for this issue ? Thanks 


Github user Tagar commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2555
  
    Found this works around the issue on Python 2.. will test more.
    
    ```
    import sys
    sys.stdout.isatty = lambda : False
    sys.stdout.encoding = None
    ```

    FYI 
    This Zeppelin issue will be worked around in Sparkling Water in following PR - https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/pull/1705
