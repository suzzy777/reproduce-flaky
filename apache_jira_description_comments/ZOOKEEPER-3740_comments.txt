Just a timeout when the test machine is busy? change that timeout to a bigger value?

yes, maybe that's all...
thanks :)

I will test that locally

yep, I think it was related to the timeout (at least on my machine). I will submit a PR.

[~maoling], I tried to cherry-pick my PR to branch-3.5, but it didn't work. I think we miss your previous fixes (ZOOKEEPER-3231,Â ZOOKEEPER-3710) there. Did you plan to port those changes to 3.5 too?
