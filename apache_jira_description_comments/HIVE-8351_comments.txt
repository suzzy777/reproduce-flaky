To facilitate running multiple builds as precommit (e.g. hadoop1 and hadoop2) we could annotate the attachment id message with the build name.

Background, every pre-commit message ends with {{ATTACHMENT ID: XXXXXX}} which is use to ensure we don't test a patch more than once due to someone uploading a patch several times in a few minutes.

We should make that to {{ATTACHMENT ID: XXXXXX - $BUILD_NAME}} and {{ATTACHMENT ID: XXXXXX - $BUILD_NAME}} and then we'd create two precommit builds, one for Hadoop-1 and one for Hadoop-2. We would do this by putting a portion of the build tag:

https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/testutils/ptest2/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/ptest/execution/PTest.java#L287

here:

https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/testutils/ptest2/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/ptest/execution/JIRAService.java#L138

Build tags have the build name and then the build number, e.g. {{PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build-1115}} so we'd want to strip off that last number.

The build for this patch has been running for almost 6 hrs. Not sure if it is some flakiness in the test infra or this patch that is causing it. Should we kill that build ? http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build/1279/

I checked couple of earlier builds before this one, all of them that actually ran took around 1 1/2 hrs.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12674890

wow, the build listened and decided to do its job just as i complained :)


It appeared to be running for 6 hours because it was behind http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/HIVE-TRUNK-HADOOP-1/ which for some reason took 4 hrs.

I am guessing there is something seriously wrong with running tests at on hadoop-1 at this point that causes some tests to take the 2hr maximum we allow, per test.

Thank you Mohit! I have committed this to trunk!
