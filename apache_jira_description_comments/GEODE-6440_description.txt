A race condition exists in {{StripedStatisticsImpl}} when used for gauge statistics that can cause gets to read partial updates. Calling {{set}} concurrently could result in multiple cells containing the set value, when only one cell should have a value, or none of the cells containing the new value when read by {{get}}.
