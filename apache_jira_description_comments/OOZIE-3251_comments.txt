{{testRetryExceptionListener}} also failed with JMX MBean problem:

{noformat}
[ERROR] testConnectionRetryExceptionListener(org.apache.oozie.service.TestJMSAccessorService)  Time elapsed: 0.704 s  <<< ERROR!
javax.management.InstanceAlreadyExistsException: org.apache.activemq:type=Broker,brokerName=localhost
	at org.apache.oozie.service.TestJMSAccessorService.testConnectionRetryExceptionListener(TestJMSAccessorService.java:198)
{noformat}

I have no clue what goes wrong and why. ActiveMQ is stopped everywhere. Let's disable JMX and get rid of this once and for all.

Yet another flaky: TestPurgeXCommand#testPurgeBundleWithCoordChildWithWFChild1 - let's create a new ticket for this... :)

Committed this to master.

Closing issue; Oozie 5.1.0 is released.
