QuidemTest and DiffRepository have incremental build issues. The reason is that they write output to {{build/resources/test}}.

The {{test}} tasks treat {{build/resources/test}} as an input, so if there are changes made to the directory the {{test}} tasks are considered no longer UP-TO-DATE.

Currently {{QuidemTest}} and {{DiffRepository}}, which are used by tests, write to this directory. DiffRepository writes test results to be compared with expected results. {{QuidemTest}} creates some sql files which are used during testing. This causes issues with incremental build support for the {{test}} tasks. I'm attaching screenshots from a build scan to show this.

Neither of these need to be written to the {{build/resources/test}} directory, they can be put somewhere else in the {{build}} directory and therefore not cause issues with incremental build support.
