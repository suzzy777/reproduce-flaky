Another argument for JSON. SAMZA-71 is supposed to introduce JSON, but perhaps we can do it independently? Having a broken sample app is a pretty bad experience. [~jakobhoman], thoughts?

JSON would be good, but SAMZA-71 looks like a bigger piece of work. Attaching a quick fix, which just removes the hashes from the job config, and adds them back in in the WikipediaConsumer implementation instead (i.e. you can't connect to IRC channels that don't start with a hash).

A bit ugly, but perhaps ok?

Argh.  The JSON work is probably only a few lines of work. Let's go ahead with that.

Writing up the JSON patch now.

Ack, missed comment here before doing ship it on RB. As Jakob said, let's just do the right thing with the JSON patch here instead.

bq. The JSON work is probably only a few lines of work.
Yeah, but those fine lines sucked.  Jackson really, really hates Scala.  

Here's a patch that switches to JSON encoding.  Unit tests pass, although I had two failures of TestStatefulTask.  After running clean and jumping back and forth from master to the branch, it worked again.  I don't see how this fix would make TestStatefulTask flakey, as this code is quite deterministic, so I'm thinking the flakiness is already there.

Got +1 from Chris on RB.  Committing and resolving.
