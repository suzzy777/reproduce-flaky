When is this expected to be released? We are really looking forward to this as this would bring zstd compression support to samza.

Any ETAs would be really helpful.

2.3.1 upgrade got merged yesterday, so will be in the next release. 

I think this was added into Kafka 2.1.0 so should be available. Let me know if not 2.4.1 was causing some test issues so only went to 2.3.1 to get all the benefits up to this version. 

Merged PR, should be in next Samza version, not sure when that is planned. Might be worth asking on PR.
