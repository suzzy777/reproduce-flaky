When I was investigating a flaky test, I realized that many places don't check the return value of `HDFSMetadataLog.get(batchId: Long): Option[T]`. When a batch is supposed to be there, the caller just ignores None rather than throwing an error. If some bug causes a query doesn't generate a batch metadata file, this behavior will hide it and allow the query continuing to run.
