GEODE-9604: Use AvailablePortHelper in MSetDUnitTest (#7011)

- This test was strangely flaky and seemed to be suffering from some
  kind of cross-test pollution when multiple tests were running in
  parallel. When stopping and restarting VMs it seems imperative to
  always reuse the same ports.

MSetDUnitTest was fixed, but there was a test in MSetNXDUnitTest that was also being @ignored for the same reason, so the same fix needs to also be applied there and the test should be enabled again.

GEODE-9604 Also fix MSetNXDunitTest (#7325)



This fixes a test-only issue in another test that was missed in the previous fix
