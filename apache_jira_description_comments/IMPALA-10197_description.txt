Sometimes it is useful to target queries at the LEADER_ONLY instead of the default CLOSEST_REPLICA. We should expose this option in Impala similar to the way KUDU_READ_MODE is exposed:
https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_kudu_read_mode.html

Currently there is a test only flag, FLAGS_pick_only_leaders_for_tests, that somewhat does this:
