In addition to moving shared code to a {{testlib/}} directory per IMPALA-4417, some consideration should be given regarding what to do with such things as:

* run_tests.py
* run-custom-cluster-tests.sh
* run-process-failure-tests.sh
* experiments/
* results/

{{tests/}} should really only contain the end-to-end tests that are required to pass -- not test tools, test artifacts (e.g., results), or experimental tests that are known to be flaky (e.g. experiments.)
