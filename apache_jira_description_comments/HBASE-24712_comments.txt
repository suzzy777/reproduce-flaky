[~stack]Â Based on the recent flaky reports, the test failures resolved in parent Jira (branch-2 and branch-2.3) should also be applied to master branch.

Raised PR and build is good, let me merge this and will monitor this test for some days. I am just forward-porting your patch with slight modification.

Thanks

Forward-ported to trunk. Will monitor this test in flaky dashboard for some days.
