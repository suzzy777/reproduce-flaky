This is an umbrella jira to support windows as a first class citizen.

The short term goals are:
 - Get unit tests passing
 - Scripts converted to windows
 - Runtime does not depend on cgywin (build can still depend on cygwin for now)
 - Hbase on windows will consume hadoop branch-1-win artifacts. 
 - Get nightly jenkins build on windows
