In the next build, both tests passed on CI. But two new tests began [re]failing with the same error:
http://cassci.datastax.com/job/cassandra-2.2_dtest_win32/73/testReport/commitlog_test/TestCommitLog/

The logic here may just be flaky on windows.

I'm unable to reproduce any of these failures locally though I see them popping up on CI on the 2.2 test runs. Are you able to reproduce any of these locally [~philipthompson]?

Assigning to [~aboudreault] as he wrote the tests.

I am currently trying to, but as yet cannot.

None of the tests that fail on CI fail locally for me, but I see {{die_failure_policy_test}} and {{test_compression_error}} fail.
