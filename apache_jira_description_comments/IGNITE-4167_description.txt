   
We are seeing sensitive cache data being output in ignite debug logging. I've tracked it down to at least two places:

1. GridToStringBuilder uses reflection to print all fields in cache objects that are not annotated with @GridToStringExclude
2. GridCacheMapEntry does a direct toString() call on the value objects in a debug log



As a fabric platform, we won't always have control over the object classes being added to/retrieved from the cache.

We must always assume that all keys and values are sensitive and should not be outputted in logs except in local debugging situations.Â To this end, we need a configuration option (turned OFF by default) that allows keys/values to be written to log messages.
