Hi [~ajamato@google.com]. I've already started working on this task and read the document. Still, there are some questions/comments I have.

I opened a [PR|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14770] as WIP just to point out the pieces of code I'm struggling with. I left some questions/comments there. I will appreciate it if you can help me answer those questions or any extra info you can give me.

Thanks a lot!

Thanks for working on this. Hope my questions helped here.
Getting the project id is tricky, but the project number is okay as well if
that's the only one available.

Hi [~ajamato@google.com], thanks for helping me out. I have another question. In the implementation guide, you pointed out this line[1]. Do you think it makes sense to call the ServiceCallMetric in this other line[2] where it actually makes the Insert request? Is there a reason why you pointed out [1]?

[1] [https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/7cd61b5e1dc4d8fc24dd75f5644f6f79a2a2f058/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/gcsio.py#L625]
 [2] [https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/7cd61b5e1dc4d8fc24dd75f5644f6f79a2a2f058/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/gcsio.py#L651]

Hi [~ajamato@google.com], I have another question. I modified the file *metrics_pb2_urns.py* where I added a couple of labels. However, it seems that this and other files in the *apache_beam/portability/api* are ignored by git and it seems to contain some other generated code.
 Is there a procedure to modify and commit changes in that folder?

Thank you very much.

You cant modify pb2 files directly, they are generated from the .proto files. Please find the associated .proto file and generate the pb2 file

You should be able to run this from the python virtualenv/sdk dir: (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Python+Tips)
python3 setup.py sdist
If this doesn't work please contact the beam dev list (its not documented anywhere)

Once you get that working, please update the handoff doc instructions as well

 

 

Also, yes there may be other code calling the GCS APIs. Please instrument all locations you identify with ServiceCallMetrics.
