Interesting, I thought I covered all the flakiness of the tests :( 
Is this only manifested in the CI machines again? Also how do you run support/coverage.sh? 

This is manifesting on my own dev machine but only under gcov.

If you have {{lcov}} installed, just run {{./support/coverage.sh}} from the mesos root. It only works with g++ (clang/python issue) and nukes your build. Be warned ;)

there are other tests that fail and i'll be adding more tickets.
