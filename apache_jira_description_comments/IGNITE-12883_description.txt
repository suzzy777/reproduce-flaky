PlatformNearCache is not actually "Near" - it just mirrors cache entries that are present on current node in CLR heap for faster access. Those entries can be primary, backup, or near.

PlatformCache seems to be a better name.

Rename:

* `PlatformNearCacheConfiguration` -> `PlatformCacheConfiguration`
* `CachePeekMode.PlatformNear` -> `CachePeekMode.Platform`
* `CacheConfiguration.PlatformNearConfiguration` -> `CacheConfiguration.PlatformCacheConfiguration`

Mark all new platform (near) cache APIs with `[IgniteExperimental]`
