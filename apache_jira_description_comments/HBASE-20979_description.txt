Current flaky test report should be including the {{tree=}} parameter in its Jenkins API calls (see https://support.cloudbees.com/hc/en-us/articles/217911388-Best-Practice-For-Using-Jenkins-REST-API).

Also should provide some info on failure so that when jobs change or go away we don't get blank failures.
