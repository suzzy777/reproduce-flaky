I'm working on ec replication and find a bug of the test case: TestAddOverReplicatedStripedBlocks#testProcessOverReplicatedAndCorruptStripedBlock.

The test case added 2 redundant block then check the block indices. It wrote 'the redundant internal blocks will not be deleted before the corrupted block gets reconstructed.'

But actually the redundant block could be deleted when there is corrupted block. The reason the test could pass is it runs very fast and checks the block indices before the redundant block is deleted and reported to the NameNode. 

The patch is both a fix and an explanation of the bug.
