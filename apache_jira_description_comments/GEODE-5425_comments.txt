GEODE-5425: Overhaul of concourse_job_performance.py
* Metric output now:
* * Highlights class failure rate as well as test failure rate
* * Warns when mutliple classes fail with the same test name, suggesting a problematic base class
* * Warns whenever completed tasks failed without a detectable test failure (often due to timeouts)
* Additional functionality has been added:
* * Can now target different teams and accept a token for authentication
* * Can now specify more than 100 most recent tests to examine.
* * Added tqdm to dependencies for prettier display.
* * Multi-threading can be enabled for faster requests.
