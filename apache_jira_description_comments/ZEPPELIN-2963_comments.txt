    [ZEPPELIN-2963] Fix paragraph aborting on next run after cancel

    ### What is this PR for?
    As mentioned in ZEPPELIN-2963, if a paragraph is cancelled while it was in scheduler's waiting queue, the next run of the paragraph always ends up in abort status. This change fixes this issue.
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    Bug Fix
    
    ### Todos
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2963
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    The scenario that we want to reproduce is that a paragraph in the notebook should be cancelled when it is still in the remote scheduler's waiting queue. This can be reproduced in various ways. Following is the approach that I used:
    1. Start zeppelin server.
    2. Create a notebook with around 10-15 paragraphs with a few paragraphs being long running (at least a few seconds)
    3. Do a "Run All" on the notebook
    4. Cancel the last paragraph (non-empty) by clicking the "Pause" button. It will move to abort status.
    5. After all paragraphs finish running, run the cancelled paragraph again. It should start running.

    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update? No
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? No
    * Does this needs documentation? No

    Build failures don't seem to be related to changes in this PR (selenium webdriver tests and flaky interpreter tests). Not sure what needs to be done to make them succeed.

    This PR seems to be fixing functionality of Run All. 
    I think if PR looks good from correctness pov then maybe we should merge this and file a follow up jira to address consistency issue, with more details about what exactly is needed.

    I think the root cause is that there're 2 fields in Job.java to represent job status. (`aborted` & `status`). Why not just removing `aborted`

    Agreed that should be the ideal solution but considering how tightly it is integrated with the core execution workflow, this will be a risky change and needs to be done with utmost care to avoid any side-effects.
