The reservation tests are not stable. They can fail for a number of reasons.
Reservations are normally not triggered unless the request is more than 2 seconds old. In some tests we lower this to 10 milliseconds. Most tests use 1 nanosecond. The tests that use the 10 msec fail intermittantly.

In the case that we have a fast(er) system to test on this delay is too long all scheduling actions will be finished before we get to the 10 msec delay.
