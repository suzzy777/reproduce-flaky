Shouldn't this one be closed now that the Java reference runner does not exist anymore?

I know that the ReferenceRunner's code [was removed|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8380/files] but the PortableRunner is still there in Java SDK, although in "reference" directory. To my current understanding, only the ReferenceRunner was to be removed and there are no plans (yet?) to remove the PortableRunner in Java sdk. The PortableRunner in Java sdk still allows you to run portable Java jobs on different execution engines (reference was only a "direct" runner). I was successfuly able to use that runner to run portable jobs on Flink.

If my understanding is correct, should we move/rename the PortableRunner's directory from "reference" to something less confusing?
 Or this code (the Java's [PortableRunner|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/b953645ed6db837d24284d7fe1fe091e7309f821/runners/reference/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/reference/PortableRunner.java]) should also be deleted and we should use Python's PortableRunner to run Java jobs?

Hi thanks for the clarification. I haven't noted that `JobServicePipelineResult` metrics method was not implemented, so this totallyh makes sense.

On the destination of these classes so far I knew that [~angoenka] was taking a look on this, but so far I don't think there is a Jira open on it.
