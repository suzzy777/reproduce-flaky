All views, tables, ks,... created in CQLTester are of the form {{table_00}}:
- While debugging tests and flakies this makes it really hard to match logs to test methods.
- Some async operations can spill log lines from a previous test method into the next's log lines which is incredibly confusing
- It's hard on the eyes and easy to mix up
- When comparing logs from 2 different branches, envs,... it's really hard to match logs

The proposed solution is for {{CQLTester}} to decorate these with the test name.
