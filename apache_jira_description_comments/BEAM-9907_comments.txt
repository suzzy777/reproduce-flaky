[~chamikara] / [~heejong] - Could you please fix or disable this test?

Any updates on this issue? What is the next action here?

Looking into this.

[~bhulette] - mentioned that this could be related to https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11574

I'm pretty confident this is due to my change. I have a rollback PR up now: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11631

Looks like when I made ExternalTransform read pipeline options, it tries to parse the pytest arguments, which often can't be translated into valid Beam pipeline options.

Thanks Brian. Assigning to Jira to you for now.

Proceeding with the rollback for now... but I think maybe a long-term fix will be to use TestPipeline in external_test. The problem seems to be that external_test.py uses Pipeline, which slurps up all the command-line arguments, rather than TestPipeline, which parses just --test-pipeline-options.

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11631 is merged. Can we close this now?

closed! thanks
