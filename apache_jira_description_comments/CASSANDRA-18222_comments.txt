After some quick discussion w/ [~dcapwell], it looks like there might not be a way to both stabilize this test and preserve its original purpose w/o CASSANDRA-18221 in place to disable (or at least make much less aggressive) the new {{SimpleProgressLog}}, which appears to be very aggressively pre-empting the write transaction in the test.

Temporarily stopping progress...
