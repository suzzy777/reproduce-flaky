Hi [~shashikant]

bq. 2.TestRocksDBStoreMBean#testJmxBeans
This is fixed by HDDS-624. There is a patch out. 

I cannot edit the bug description for some reason, but one more for the list:
- TestReplicationSupervisor

TestKeys#testPutAndGetKey seem to be fixed HDDS-639. Other failing tests seem to be working locally on my set up.

This list is almost certainly obsolete now. Let's file a separate jira if we still have flaky tests.
