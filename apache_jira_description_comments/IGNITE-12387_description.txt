Right now we don't check server version before doing requests for newer features like Affinity Awareness and Cluster API. This causes exceptions like "Invalid re
quest op code: 5000", which are cryptic for the user.

Fix this:
* Affinity Awareness: disable it automatically if there is no server support; log a warning to the log (add logging by adding IgniteClientConfiguration.Logger property)
* Individual methods and features like Cluster API - throw an exception with user-friendly explanation
