We currently use private versions for Surefire & JUnit since HBASE-4763.

This JIRA traks what we need to move to official versions.

Surefire 2.11 is just out, but, after some tests, it does not contain all what we need.

JUnit. Could be for JUnit 4.11. Issue to monitor:
https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/359: fixed in our version, no feedback for an integration on trunk

Surefire: Could be for Surefire 2.12. Issues to monitor are:
329 (category support): fixed, we use the official implementation from the trunk
786 (@Category with forkMode=always): fixed, we use the official implementation from the trunk
791 (incorrect elapsed time on test failure): fixed, we use the official implementation from the trunk
793 (incorrect time in the XML report): Not fixed (reopen) on trunk, fixed on our version.
760 (does not take into account the test method): fixed in trunk, not fixed in our version
798 (print immediately the test class name): not fixed in trunk, not fixed in our version
799 (Allow test parallelization when forkMode=always): not fixed in trunk, not fixed in our version
800 (redirectTestOutputToFile not taken into account): not yet fix on trunk, fixed on our version

800 & 793 are the more important to monitor, it's the only ones that are fixed in our version but not on trunk.
