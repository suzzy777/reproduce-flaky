Yes its better to have a special health check for route controller that are DOWN from beginning, and are only UP when the route startup phase is complete. For the supervising route controller this means the first phase of starting routes. If you schedule a route to be restarted N times with X delay between, then the controller may be UP but the given route is DOWN.



TODO: camel-spring-boot add new option *DONE*


Okay there is a new option you need to turn on, to have it DOWN during restarting phase: routeControllerUnhealthyOnExhausted

If using jbang then its something ala:

 camel run foo.java --health --console --prop=camel.main.routeControllerSuperviseEnabled=true --prop=camel.main.routeControllerUnhealthyOnRestarting=true --prop=camel.main.routeControllerBackOffMaxAttempts=10 --prop=camel.main.routeControllerUnhealthyOnExhausted=true


There is an example at
https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/route-controller

Having to enable 2 options to make it DOWN for faulty routes is a bit confusing, so I created a ticket to see if we can flip the default values for these options. See linked JIRA ticket
