Beeline ignores the next line/command that follows a command with semicolon and comments.

Example 1:
select *
from table1; -- comments
select * from table2;

In this case, only the first command is executed.. second command "select * from table2" is not executed.

------

Example 2:
select *
from table1; -- comments
select * from table2;
select * from table3;
In this case, first command and third command is executed. second command "select * from table2" is not executed.
