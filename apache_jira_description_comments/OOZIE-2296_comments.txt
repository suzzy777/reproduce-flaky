Here's the usage:

[~rkanter] I tested your patch and made a minor modification in {{saveThreadDumpPage}}  to use the proper API call to get JVM info (sending request to {{OOZIE_BASE_URL/admin/jvminfo.jsp}}  instead of {{OOZIE_BASE_URL//admin/jvminfo.jsp}}).

Tests and documentation are still missing.

[~rkanter] Do you mind if I take over this task?

Sure.

So far I only added just a couple of unit tests for validating user input.

Unfortunately, in its current form, MiniOozieTestCase cannot be used for testing the tool. {{getClient()}} of {{LocalOozie}} can only be used to run workflows and get wf statuses. It does not provide full oozie API. Many REST API calls (such as listing environment variables, sys props, sharelibs, etc.) result in errors / no-op. If TestOozieDiagBundleCollector extended MiniOozieTestCase, other tool tests like TestOozieDBCLI would have impact on these tests too (resources contain {{fake-oozie-site.xml}} and {{hsqldb-oozie-site.xml}}).

I added some comments to the review. I would possibly add more, depending on how we agree on the refactoring/restructuring part.

[~pbacsko] many thanks for the reivew. I fixed some of the issues mentioned. I will also try to refactor the code (extracting classes mostly) to make it more testable.

Findbugs warning with reason "... reads a file whose location might be specified by user input" is expected as we allow the user to specify the directory where the bundle zip will be stored.

[~pbacsko], [~gezapeti], [~andras.piros] can you take a look at the latest patch? 

Retrieving Oozie launcher logs is currently done with the {{LogsCLI}} client tool from Yarn. If we lose connection to Resource Manager when trying to fetch launcher logs for a job and the connection cannot be re-established in 30 seconds, we will give up trying, display stack trace and some error message and continue to collect diagnostic information on the rest of the applications.

You mentioned in one of the comments on RB the idea of getting the DAG image, especially now that OOZIE-2406 is done and we can get a dot file now too.  This is a great idea!

However, we should probably wait for OOZIE-3059 first.  It's to add a CLI command to get the image.  While you could have the tool use the REST API directly to do that, that's going to be 90% overlap with the code needed for OOZIE-3059, so you may as well do OOZIE-3059 instead.

I'm fine with getting the image being a followup JIRA if you don't want to block the rest of this on OOZIE-3059.

I will investigate failure of {{testJMXInstrumentation}} and {{testImportInvalidDataLeavesTablesEmpty}} soon (these should not be related to the patch in my opinion). {{testMaterizationLookup}} is known to be flaky.

- {{testImportInvalidDataLeavesTablesEmpty}} failure is related to test execution order, see OOZIE-3125
- {{testJMXInstrumentation}} is tracked by OOZIE-3105

rebased patch, TestDBLoadDump should be fixed
