Zeppelin job management.
Zeppelin is not easy to have a current status and management of the entire node.
In particular, in many cases Notebook is made.
For this, I am ready to function with a separate page named 'JOB'.
I confirm that this feature is part of the Road-map of the Zeppelin.
Consider briefly to attach the small image of this mock-up image and functionality.
I want feedback from users and developers who Zeppelin.
Thank you.
