A recent ticket, CASSANDRA-13701, changed the way dtests run, resulting in a [30% increase in run time|https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@cassandra.apache.org/msg15606.html]. While that change was accepted, we wanted to spin out a ticket to optimize dtests in an attempt to gain back some of that runtime.

At this time we don't have concrete improvements in mind, so the first order of this ticket will be to analyze the state of things currently, and try to ascertain some valuable optimizations. Once the problems are understood, we will break down subtasks to divide the work.

Some areas to consider:
* cluster reuse
* C* startup optimizations
* Tests that should be ported to in-JVM dtest or even unit tests
