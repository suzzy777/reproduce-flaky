The PVR tests seem to be passing fine and then failing consecutively for no reason: https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Java_PVR_Flink_Batch/ 

It looks like the outrageous parallelism, i.e. number of available cores, is responsible for the flakiness if there is additional load on the build slaves. We should lower the parallelism.
