This is yet another reminder of Spak runner flaky streaming tests.
I'll add some properties to Spark's {{Read.Unbounded}} to block until read is complete (mainly for tests).   

There are currently three tests reading from Kafka (also testing {{Read.Unbounded}}), and until we have proper streaming support via triggers we rely (optimistically) on elements to be read in the same batch.
The flakiness comes from the fact that this becomes very unpredictable on slow environments (such as Jenkins).
By adding the possibility to manually set the bound on max records per batch (up until now it was only via {{RateController}} feedback) I can give batches a longer read time and stop reading (before this time ended) when I hit the max records bound.
This should do the trick though in some extreme cases of verrrry slow env. it could still happen.
This is only putting-out fires until I provide trigger support.
