Expired TTL snapshots from a dropped table are only removed if the node is not restarted after the table is dropped.

The reason for this is because {{SnapshotManager}} is using the old implementation of {{listsnapshots}} to load snapshots in memory during node startup, before CASSANDRA-16843 is fixed so it doesn't keep track of snapshots of dropped tables.

We should make {{SnapshotManager}} use the new implementation to load snapshots of dropped tables in memory, what ensures they will be removed when expired.
