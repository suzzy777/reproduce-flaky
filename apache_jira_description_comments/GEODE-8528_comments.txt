I attempted to replicate this both locally and in the cloud, but wasn't able to reproduce it after a significant number of runs. It's possible that this failure was due to an environment issue with the disk the test was running on or that this is a very rare flaky failure caused by the tests unique method of shutting down server 2. I don't think it is related to GEODE-8353 as I had originally speculated.

Seen on support/1.12 in [DistributedTestOpenJDK8 #126|https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/teams/main/pipelines/apache-support-1-12-main/jobs/DistributedTestOpenJDK8/builds/126] ... see [test results|http://files.apachegeode-ci.info/builds/apache-support-1-12-main/1.12.1-build.0148/test-results/distributedTest/1606984119/] or download [artifacts|http://files.apachegeode-ci.info/builds/apache-support-1-12-main/1.12.1-build.0148/test-artifacts/1606984119/distributedtestfiles-OpenJDK8-1.12.1-build.0148.tgz].

GEODE-9103: Fix failures in PutAllClientServerDistributedTest (#6542)

Prevent ServerConnectivityExceptions when test encounters long GCs or
slow CPUs.

Add test-only system property to AbstractCacheServer for
maximumTimeBetweenPings.

Use system property to set maximumTimeBetweenPings to GeodeAwaitility
timeout.

Use GeodeAwaitility timeout for client pool readTimeout.

Remove unnecessary client pool settings within each test.

Inline getCause within Throwable assertions.

Fixes GEODE-8528, GEODE-9103, GEODE-9242, GEODE-9296.

Merged fix to develop:
