In MOR table tests, due to small file handling, we end up expanding existing file group to pack both updates and inserts and hence no log files were generated. but tests expects compaction to happen after 5 commits which fails the test in such cases.

Already made a fix to some of the tests: [https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7720/] 

but we might need to triage and fix any other similar tests. 

one thing we want to ensure is, we do have explicit small file handling tests for MOR table so that disabling at other places is ok.
