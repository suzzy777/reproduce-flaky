The Livy interpreter will return incorrect results if a row contains \n or \t characters.

In the case of the newline, the result will be:
* Line is missing from results if the \n appears anywhere but the end of a cell
* `String index out of range: 17` if it appears at the end of a cell

In the case of the tab, the result will be misaligned columns if the tab appears in the middle of a cell

The output showing these error is attached.
