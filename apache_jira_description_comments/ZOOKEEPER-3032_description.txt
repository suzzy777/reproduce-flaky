Create a project structure that separates the different parts of ZooKeeper into a more meaningful packages for the future maven build.

This should be done in iterations to limit the impact.

* First iteration - safe changes including moving src/docs to zk-docs, creating zk-it empty directory. Build and conf directory remains unchanged. These changes also have minimum impact on PRâ€™s.
* Second iteration - move src/recipes to zk-recipes.
* Third iteration - move src/contrib to zk-contrib.
* Fourth iteration - move src/c to zk-client (java will be moved in Phase 2)
* Fifth iteration - move jute under src directory

* *Sixth iteration* - move src/java/main to zk-server, also separate client code from server code, move common files to zookeeper-common.
* 
*Modification*
It is not feasible to separate core java files into server, client and common. It will remain in zookeeper-server.
