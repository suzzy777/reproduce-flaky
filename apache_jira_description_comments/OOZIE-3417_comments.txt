Thanks [~nobigo] for the patch, could you please upload your patch to the [review board|https://reviews.apache.org/].

[~nobigo] I've tried to assign the JIRA to you, but I was unable.

Hi,[~asalamon74], Thank you very much, I have to upload my patch to review board then you can assign the Jira to me ?  or have other reason make you can't assign? I have try to upload my patch to review board.

[~nobigo] Review board upload and JIRA assignment are two independent things. I've asked you to upload the patch to review board, because it's much easier to check the code and suggest further modifications. 

I've asked [~kmarton] and [~gezapeti] for help, after that I was able to assign the ticket to you.

[~asalamon74] Thank you very much.

Hi, [~asalamon74], I have a problem want to ask you for advices. When I login review board web, It need standard LDAP username and password. How I can get it?Thank you very much.

[~nobigo], have you tried with the same username/password you are using here?

[~kmarton] Yes. I have tried but it failed. I can't login. Can you tell me how to register?Thank you very much.[~asalamon74] and [~gezapeti]

[~nobigo] Probably it's a reviewboard problem, I've opened an infra JIRA: INFRA-17658

[~kmarton] [~gezapeti] Thanks for the suggestion.

Hi,[~asalamon74], It seems to need an ASF account .I'm going to apply ， But It takes a long time. Is there another way to finish review?Thank you very  much.

[~nobigo], I have uploaded it for you: [https://reviews.apache.org/r/69771/]

 

[~nobigo] I left a few comments on the review board.

[~asalamon74] Thank you . I have try to fixing code. Then I will upload a new patch.

[~kmarton] Thank you upload patch. I have update one. Please upload again.Thank you very much

[~asalamon74] Hi,Can you help me review again?Thank you !

[~nobigo] The patch is looking much better. If I compare the methods, for instance
{noformat}
mkdir(context, fsConf, nameNodePath, path);
{noformat}
 and
{noformat}
doMkdirOperation(Context context, Path nameNodePath, XConfiguration fsConf, Element commandElement)
{noformat}
The order of the arguments are different. Could you modify your methods to use a more similar order like: {{context, fsConf, nameNodePath, commandElement}}.

[~kmarton] Can you also please review. Thanks

[~asalamon74]  and [~kmarton]. Hi,Can you help me review again?Thank you !

[~nobigo], thank your for the patch. Now it looks much better than if was. 

I would have one nice to have suggestion related to your last patch here:
{code:java}
public static final String FS_TYPE_MKDIR = "mkdir";
public static final String FS_TYPE_DELETE = "delete";
{code}
 this and the other command are more {{commands}} or {{operations}} than {{types}}, so I would suggest to use a more appropriate naming like: {{FS_OP_MKDIR, FS_OP_DELETE}} etc.

 

[~kmarton] I have changed TYPE to OP, make it more appropriate.Thank you very much.

Great! Thank you [~nobigo]! +1

Let's wait for the precommit Jenkins job to start and finish, and then I will commit your changes.

The test error seems unrelated. However I have kicked a new run.
