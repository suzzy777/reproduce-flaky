CopyUtils uses FileUtils.distCp to copy files but doesn't check the return value. It returns false if the copy fails.
Now, REPL LOAD and EXPORT/IMPORT commands internally uses CopyUtils to copy data files across clusters and here it may return success even if file copy fails and may cause data loss.

Need to throw error and retry.
