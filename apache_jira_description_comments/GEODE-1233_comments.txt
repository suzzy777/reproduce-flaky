GEODE-1233: apply FlakyTest category to flickering tests

* perform basic analysis on all JIRA tickets filed against flickering (intermittently failing) tests
* annotate each flickering test method with "@Category(FlakyTest.class) // GEODE-xxx: basic analysis of pausible causes for flakiness"
* label each flickering JIRA ticket with "Flaky"
* add comment to each flickering JIRA ticket with the same "basic analysis of pausible causes for flakiness"
* fix some obvious cases of "eats exceptions"
* add some TODOs to problem areas found in code
