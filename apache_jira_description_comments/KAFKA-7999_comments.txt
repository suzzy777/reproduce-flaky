https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6326 was merged to address this issue. We were not able to reproduce it locally, and suspect that this failure happens when many tests run in parallel on low resource VMs. Increasing the timeout (as in the linked PR) should reduce the chances of random failure.

PR: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6326

Updating fixed version from 2.2.1 to 2.2.0 because we cut a new RC.
