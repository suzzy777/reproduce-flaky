Copied from one of the discussions:

Can you use TimeUnit in the method to set it so it's clear what the unit is?
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html

So, the idea would be to go from setExpiry(int seconds) to setExpiry(int duration, TimeUnit unit) and then internally we change it to milliseconds or seconds depending on what we want to do.

Or maybe use Duration?

I see many libraries that use setExpiry(int duration, TimeUnit unit), so I'd vote for that.

I've just opened a PR with an example of changing one method to using the TimeUnit.  I'd love someone to review and say "yes Eric, that's the logical change" before I do the others!

Hi all..    I need to ask for help from the braintrust, as I'm pretty frustrated with this effort...   For some reason "org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.ConcurrentUpdateSolrClientBuilderTest.testSocketTimeoutOnCommit" fails frequently for me, but I can't for the life figure it out...   It fails frequently, but not always reliably...   I can't tell if it's something I'm doing, or a flaky test?  

ERROR: The following test(s) have failed:
  - org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.ConcurrentUpdateSolrClientBuilderTest.testSocketTimeoutOnCommit (:solr:solrj)
    Test output: /Users/epugh/Documents/projects/solr-epugh/solr/solrj/build/test-results/test/outputs/OUTPUT-org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.ConcurrentUpdateSolrClientBuilderTest.txt
    Reproduce with: gradlew :solr:solrj:test --tests "org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.ConcurrentUpdateSolrClientBuilderTest.testSocketTimeoutOnCommit" -Ptests.jvms=4 "-Ptests.jvmargs=-XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=1 -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=120m" -Ptests.seed=64A7B5D9DFAC5FB9 -Ptests.file.encoding=US-ASCII
 

Would love someone to look at either of the PR's I've pushed up and test them...   At this point I'm kind of out of ideas on this....

I cannot see that test failing at [http://fucit.org/solr-jenkins-reports/failure-report.html] so looks suspicious.

I checked out the PR branch (v2) and ran the test multiple times without issue, also beasted. What does the test failure say?

so, [~dsmiley] figured out the actual bug in my PR....   I am still getting intermittant failures locally, but it may be my slow laptop, not sure.   Also Crave ran a successful test post the bug fix: https://github.com/apache/solr/actions/runs/4163746728/jobs/7204518282

Thank you for testing [~janhoy] as I started thinking I was crazy....

SOLR-16595: Standardize Solr Client Builders handling of times (#1338)

* Introducing TimeUnit into Builder methods to allow callers to determine time unit.
* Internally name each property with what unit of measurement to use, and convert to that in the Builder.

Thank you to everyone who reviewed and helped me get unstuck.

Thanks for this nice improvement!
