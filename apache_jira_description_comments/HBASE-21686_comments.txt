Did a pass on things expressly targeting 1.2.10

* HBASE-17229 closed as `won't fix` with a suggestion to upgrade to 1.4
* HBASE-21013 unscheduled from branch-1.2

Did a quick pass of things not backported to 1.2:

* HBASE-21492 CellCodec Written To WAL Before It's Verified

which led me to notice this one we missed back in 2016 :(

* HBASE-15752 ClassNotFoundException is encountered when custom WAL codec is not found in WALPlayer job

ref guide looks up to date.

fixed missing 1.2.10 fixVersion:

* HBASE-21504 If enable FIFOCompactionPolicy, a compaction may write a "empty" hfile whose maxTimeStamp is long max. This kind of hfile will never be archived.

Otherwise git and jira line up.

* updated version #
* updated CHANGES

* (edit) CHANGES.txt


compat report between 1.2.9 and current branch-1.2 flagged some changes to HMaster and SnapshotManager HBASE-21387. Since those are {{IA.LimitedPrivate TOOLS, CONFIG}} I think they're fine.

it also complained about a change in return type for {{WALCellCodec.getWALCellCodecClass}}, but that method was package-private prior to the change, so  I'm fine with that.

flaky dashboard as of this morning looks okay:

https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-1.2/148/artifact/dashboard.html

new-ish nightly jobs for branch-1.2 are failing due to HBASE-21687, but I don't think that needs to be a blocker.

[build #600|https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-1.2/600/] covers everything except for the two backports I just did. Those tests work fine locally.

unless something surprising happens with the nightly job I'm going to tag and make RC0 off of 18f428abb64b405de24d164425e470512e82f287 later  this evening.

pushed 1.2.10 docs to website repo

pushed a signed tag for rel/1.2.10 (ref on [gitbox|https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=hbase.git;a=tag;h=b998c88fe4f97566dcc2fa2fbad7b8776d3bdc50] and [github|https://github.com/apache/hbase/releases/tag/rel%2F1.2.10]) and confirmed it shows as "verified" on the github UI.

reopening as our Peter noticed I forgot to update the downloads page on the website (and I want to make sure all the steps are on this jira)

* added 1.2.10 to the downloads page
* triggered a website build
