TestRSGroups is flaky. It is stable when run in isolation but when run as part of the suite with concurrent executors it can fail. The current running time of this unit on my dev box is ~240 seconds (4 minutes), which is far too much time. This unit should be broken up 5 to 8 ways, grouped by functionality under test.
