Apacheds server is used in some security tests in Hadoop-common, hadoop-hdfs modules with "startKdc" profile.
The build script downloads the server, unpacks it, configures, and runs.

The problem is that used URL http://newverhost.com/pub//directory/apacheds/unstable/1.5/1.5.7/apacheds-1.5.7.tar.gz does not work any more (returns 404).

The suggested patch peremetrizes the URL, so that it can be set in single palce in the parent pom.xml, and sets it to the workable value.
