[~pnowojski]: I had an offline chat with [~sewen] about this. He mentioned to me that in the past, we were not printing exceptions during cancellation, to avoid polluting the log. It seems that the behavior of this has changed with the {{LegacySourceFunctionThread}}. Should we change it back? 

 

Hi [~rmetzger] , this is independent of legacy source and more related to the recent work of Piotr on better exception handling for mailbox.

We are trying to improve that handling further by being more lenient on processing specific exceptions and I added a PR that replaces your fix with another fix. I'd like to keep the tests as they are as we really want to surpress these kind of exceptions while still avoid swallowing other exceptions during cancellation.

merged commit 4852002 into apache:master
merged commit 8acd60b661a7c92a5922ae566d547dbfad799c8c into release-1.10

The test failed again: https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/flink/jobs/671755595?utm_medium=notification&utm_source=slack
This time with this error (on 1.10)

I guess this exception is something we don't want to log during cancellation?

Yes [~rmetzger] and it was fixed on master as part of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-15751 .  You can check my last comment there for an explanation why is this issue still in the release-1.10. At that point of time we didn't know that other tests can also be failing. If you think we should backport the proper fix to release-1.10, please respond in the other ticket.
