Cassandra-builds patch at https://github.com/apache/cassandra-builds/compare/master...thelastpickle:mck/jenkins--print-git-shas-and-website-build 

(This will be committed first, before attempting the in-tree patch.)

[~mck] any chance you can create a PR so I can add comments? I'd swear there was a way to comment on diffs but I can't find it. Also can I see some dev-branch test run with this patch? So far:
- Why in some places the dtests repro clone was removed?
- IIrc I saw _dtests_ repro SHA's missing, whereas C* SHA was always somewhere around. So it's nice it will be now more handy but dtests SHA should be reachable as well somewhere. That's why seeing a run with this patch applied would be great

Edit: removed git clean -xdff comment
wdyt?

bq. I'd swear there was a way to comment on diffs but I can't find it.

bq. Also can I see some dev-branch test run with this patch?

At this point it has to be tested on a separate (local) jenkins installation. (Which I've done.)
This is also *the testing* before any in-tree patch.

bq. Is 'git clean -xdff' a thing …

It was there in the script before :shrug:
I can change it to `git clean -xdf` if we're sure that's the correct command??

bq. Why in some places the dtests repro clone was removed?

The dtest clone happens inside the docker container. Cloning outside was meaningless.

bq. So it's nice it will be now more handy but dtests SHA should be reachable as well somewhere.

Yeah, let me chase this up and see how/where a "cassandra-dtest.head" can be added…
Thanks for the feedback.




Yes.


- Could you doublecheck in your local run in the dtests SHA is somewhere to be seen? If it is some complicated thing bc of Docker maybe an echo of the SHA even if it's outside them would be great.
- Yes {{-xdff}} is a thing TIL

Done.

Example, from a dtest build where SHAs from inside the dtest docker container…
{code}
dtest.sh (dtest 1/1024) cassandra: 68aca10 Adam Holmberg Tue Sep 15 15:56:39 2020 -0500 Remove flaky channelRead_Normal test that wasn't doing much
dtest.sh (dtest 1/1024) cassandra-dtest: 5db813c Yifan Cai Tue Sep 8 14:41:12 2020 -0700 When compaction gets interrupted, the exception should include the compactionId
dtest.sh (dtest 1/1024) cassandra-builds: 13f0f39 Mick Semb Wever Fri Sep 18 12:33:12 2020 +0200 squash{code}

This output will appear in the dtest runs and in the pipeline run (for each dtest split).

This required an addition to the patch, see the additional "squash" commit on the existing {{mck/jenkins--print-git-shas-and-website-build}} branch.

Nice [this|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-builds/compare/master...thelastpickle:mck/jenkins--print-git-shas-and-website-build#diff-9583635fcf3fb59093dea114f5b6c609R12] is what I was missing.

+1 from me: I haven't tested the script in a jenkins though, but if you have is good enough for me.

Thanks [~Bereng]. Committed [dfc3adf28768ded5f84a3f23ff926695263fbd5a|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-builds/commit/dfc3adf28768ded5f84a3f23ff926695263fbd5a]. Will let that run for a bit before starting on the in-tree patch.
