KUDU-3042: Fix invalid DCHECK when rpc is cancelled then times out

The timeout handling code in Connection::HandleOutboundCallTimeout
assumes that when a timeout is triggered the OutboundCall must still
be valid. In the case of an asynchronous rpc that was cancelled before
the timeout was hit, this will not be the case.

The fix is to check if the OutboundCall is still valid and return
without processing the timeout if it is not.

Testing:
- Added timeout tests to TestCancellation to inject timeouts at
  OutboundCall states from READY to SENT.
- Tested in Impala in the context of implementing IMPALA-8712.

[rpc-test] fix flaky TestCancellation

KUDU-3042 added a test case for the interaction between rpc
cancellation and rpc timeouts. This test was flaky as it assumed that
rpcs that are cancelled will return with an aborted status, which is
not always the case due to cancellation being best effort.

The fix is to make the test more permissive by allowing the rpcs to
fail with either an aborted or a timed out status.
