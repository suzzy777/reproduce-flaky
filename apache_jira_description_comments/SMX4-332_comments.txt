Can some committer please create an integration branch for nmr and features and commit the attached patches to this branch? 

This will facilitate review and identification of any further work that may be necessary.

The NMR patch is supplied in two versions, the first (nmr_patch) created using the normal svn diff, the second (nmr_create_patch) created via the svn-create-patch perl script in case you prefer to apply using svn-apply - this would be more convenient as there are a number of new elements. 



From the dev list:

"As I mentioned on another thread, there was a problematic dependency between the NMR/features integration tests and the old kernel AbstractIntegrationTest framework. After discussing this issue with Guillaume last week, I took the pragmatic approach of moving a cut-down version of the testing support into the NMR repo. The problematic tests are now passing."


I created branches for NMR and Features in the sandbox here: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/servicemix/sandbox/karaf/ Both branches are from trunk as of tonight.

I applied the patches (I had trouble with the nmr_create_patch, it looks like it might be corrupt), but neither project compiles so I hope that was expected.  If there is something wrong I can easily do this over again so let me know if this should have been compiling.

Thanks Chris,

I missed a few files in that first NMR patch, so I've attached another for you to apply (nmr_patch2). 

BTW the first nmr_patch and nmr_create_patch were intended to be either-or-but-not-both (depending on your preference for applying via the patch command or the svn-apply script).

All should build once the latest patch is applied, though I've seen some flakiness in the assembly phase (may be environment-specific).

While looking into this, I notice there are still dependencies in some of the META-INF/Spring configs on the old kernel-style gshell, so I'll have to figure out how to replace this with the Karaf-specific NamespaceHandler for command-bundles etc.  This looks blueprint-specific in Karaf, as opposed to the Spring BeanDefinitionParser-based mechanism in kernel.

This raises the general question of co-existance with Karaf's usage of blueprint service. IIRC Guillaume intended that co-existance with Spring-DM would be supported in Karaf, I just need confirmation that this is indeed the case and do the appropriate testing. In the longer term , I guess the goal would be to switch NMR and features over to blueprint also?

Ok, patches applied and both builds are working.  If anyone else wants to check out and review Eoghan's Karaf integration work, here are the URLs.

http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/servicemix/sandbox/karaf/features

Build NMR first, then Features.

Thanks to Eoghan Glynn for putting in so much work on this.
