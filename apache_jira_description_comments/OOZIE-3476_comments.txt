This is just a test/demonstration to migrate from JUnit3 to JUnit4 in this very simple class.

The modification also sped up the test because we don't need the {{XTestCase}} initializations. Old time was 23s, new time is 10ms.

Since we need to convert more than 300 test classes, it's not a good idea to handle them one by one. I repurpose this Jira to handle the "simple" cases. Classes where we don't have a setup/teardown, so probably we can easily convert them to junit 4.

DO NOT COMMIT PATCH VERSION 1

Instead of one single class the second patch fixes 31 classes.
