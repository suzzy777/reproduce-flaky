GeometryUDT currently uses ArrayType(ByteType()) as the serialized data type for geometries. The array type in Spark is an array of objects and not primitive types. Every byte is boxed into a Byte object and the object reference is stored in the array. This adds a significant overhead. The more specialized BinaryType is an array of primitive bytes.

 

I did a quick benchmark chaining a bunch of st-functions, no joins. With BinaryType the performance increased by roughly 30%.

 

The old Apache commons-codec bundled with sernetcdf needs to be fixed first. Otherwise Spark fails when calling encodeHexString() as seen in https://github.com/apache/incubator-sedona/pull/704
