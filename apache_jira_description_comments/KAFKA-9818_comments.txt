   The error message on the ticket is not helpful. To figure out why the test fails, we need to improve the error message first and wait until it fails again.

This might be related to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9819 and we might want to do the same fix for both. Thank to [~ableegoldman] for pointing it out.

[~mjsax] thanks for the improved error logging, saw this fail again locally with

java.lang.AssertionError: Messages received: - [AdminClient clientId=adminclient-74] Connection to node -1 (localhost/127.0.0.1:8080) could not be established. Broker may not be available. - [AdminClient clientId=adminclient-116] Connection to node -1 (localhost/127.0.0.1:8080) could not be established.
