The _storm-kafka_ `KafkaSpout` emits a metric group called _kafkaPartition_

These metric names are prefixed with 
{noformat}
Partition{host=some.broker.host.mycompany.com:9092,-topic=some/topic/name,-partition=40}
{noformat}

Which makes for ugly, difficult to discover metrics on systems like Graphite.

The metric prefix should match the metrics emitted by the _kafkaOffset_ metric group that look like:

_topicName/partition_<partitionNum>_
