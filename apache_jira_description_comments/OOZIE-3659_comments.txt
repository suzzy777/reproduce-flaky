Patch available at [https://github.com/apache/oozie/pull/71]

Please kindly review, thanks!

 

Thanks for your change, [~AlexaD] . Those test cases are just testing the Oozie CLI argument parsing and no more. However, I agree that port 11 would be almost impossible to allocate and the default port is indeed 11000.

Have you checked the other test cases and documentation if there is another such typo?

Also please upload here the latest patch: OOZIE-3659-001.patch and press the "Submit Patch" button on the Jira.

Thanks

The test asserts for the following error message: "Error while connecting Oozie server. No of retries = 2." Isn't it possible that the whole point of selecting 11 is that we are definitely not able to connect to this port. If we use 11000 and localhost has a running Oozie, this test might fail. 

[~asalamon74] Thanks for the clarification. I now agree with you that this is actually not a typo. [~dionusos] Could you also confirm that and I'll close this ticket?

[~AlexaD] What [~asalamon74] says seems valid. Also what you found as a typo is more like an ambiguous string. So, Alexa, if you would like to, feel free to make these ports clear. For example with comments or a properly named variable to sign this port 11 is intended and used to make the command fail. What do you think about that?

Thanks [~dionusos], I've updated the ticket & corresponding pull request and uploaded the patch with variable and comments added. Please review, thanks!

Hi [~dionusos], does the test result look good or do I need to modify anything?
