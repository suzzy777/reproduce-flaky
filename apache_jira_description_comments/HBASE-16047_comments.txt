cc [~tedyu@apache.org] now I can repro it locally so unless you have a patch I'll take it

I am quite busy today. So please go ahead.

Looks like this was a regression.

Seems like 8c46caacc93b73ba040155e47b131a353d57550c  (HBASE-16023 - fastpath FIFO) broke it. cc [~stack]

Easiest fix is to make this test use deadline scheduler. let me attach trivial patch

test passes with it for me

+1

Thanks, pushed to master, branch-1, branch-1.3. cc [~appy]

Dang. Sorry about that [~mantonov]. Sorry for pain caused. Thanks for the fix. Let me see why it was failing... 

No worries. I'm pretty sure it failed because in this test we set queue size on the server to 0 and expect call queue too big exception - but with direct hand-off there's a handler to pick up your call bypassing the queue.

Thanks [~mantonov] for the quick fix.
[~stack] I think the new executor can use a set of corresponding tests. For eg. the expected value for this test would be 0. What do you say?

Btw [~mantonov], TestFastFail will get clean chit from flaky infra once it passes sufficient number of times (which is set to 50 right now).

Good to know! Thanks.
