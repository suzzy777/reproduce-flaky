I see the problem. I changed things from POJO to AutoValue. Since Java reflection makes no guarantees about the order it returns things, this means that schema inference is always non deterministic in the order of fields.  However reflection tends to return variables in order, so it happened to work before. When it comes to listing member methods, reflection is far less deterministic (I suspect it returns things in hashmap order or something).

 

The fix is to access by name instead of index. So replace row.getString(0) with row.getString("stringField"). I'll send a PR to fix this.
