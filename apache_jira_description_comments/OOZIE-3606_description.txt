In case we want to check file availability on abfss file system in scope of a decision node and we have access to that file system only using a key file which is password protected then currently we are blocked as we cannot allow configuring hadoop.security.credstore.java-keystore-provider.password-file globally.

This is why this ticket is created to propose a solution for this issue:
 * allow special file system configurations only for file system EL functions
 * let them configure globally via oozie-site.xml and for every workflow independently
