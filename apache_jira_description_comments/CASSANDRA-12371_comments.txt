It looks like when these types were added, there were no updates to {{JsonTest.java}} to cover them.  As the error message indicates, we're explicitly checking {{instanceof Byte}} and {{instanceof Short}}, which is probably not the correct thing to do, although it may be possible to get jackson to return these types instead of an Integer.

Thanks for the patch!

It looks good to me, so I've started CI test runs:

If those look good, this should be ready to commit.

[~thobbs] I'm looking at jenkins reports, but I'm not sure what to make out of it :) Some builds are green, some aborted, and most of them yellow with random (?) test failures. I have a feeling that the failures have very little to do with tiny&smallints in json, but I only checked out the cassandra repo yesterday, so that's pretty much my whole knowledge of the codebase ;).

Yes, we typically have a small number of known failing tests along with some tests that are known to be flaky.  I've restarted the 3.0-testall run (which was aborted).  Everything else appears to be a known failure or is unrelated to this change, so if that test run is good, this should be good to go.  I'll let you know if there is anything that needs to be fixed.

The rerun tests look good, so I've committed this as {{dc8a017c7909abc4086ecbb0540c75c88991ab73}} to 2.2 and merged up to 3.0, 3.9, and trunk.

Thanks again for the patch!

Thanks very much! :)
