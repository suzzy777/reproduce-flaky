Hi, [~hyukjin.kwon]. Could you take a look at this `error: release unlocked lock` in Jenkins?

i think this is a bug in py4j or old pypy itself. I have seen this errors but have no idea from what I know. This apparently happens in PyPy only.

Is it a blocker BTW [~dongjoon]?

Got it. I lower it to `Major`.

It turns out that this starts to make `master` SBT Hadoop-2.7 jobs fail consecutively 5 times recently.

I took a look related issue to this. Seems like it's very likely the issue from the old PyPy. It will be fixed once we drop Python 2 completely and change PyPy version in our Jenkins.
