The query below when run without a mem limit needs roughly 2.4g of memory in the scan.
My expectation is that I get a mem limit exceeded error when running the same query with a mem limit below that 2.4g. However, we hit a DCHECK in the scanner.

Repro:
1. Grab Parquet file from here:
vd0212.halxg.cloudera.com:/data/1/huge_array_parquet/100m_array.parq
2. Copy file to HDFS and use CREATE TABLE LIKE FILE
3. The query below runs fine without a mem limit:
{code}
select cnt from huge_array_table t, (select count(item) cnt from t.f) v;
{code}
4. Set the mem limit to 1g and run the query again. You will hit this DCHECK:
{code}
hdfs-parquet-scanner.cc:1299] Check failed: !parse_status_.ok()
{code}
