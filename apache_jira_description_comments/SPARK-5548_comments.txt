This test passes on my laptop (OSX). Will try to run the tests on some other machine. Is there some specification or docker environment for running tests?


I tried also on ubuntu with Java 7 - the tests passes too... Now, I'm trying on Ubuntu + Java 6...

Java 6 test passed... except kinesis 

Maybe this fails non-deterministically?  Or maybe there are multiple failure modes, e.g. it sometimes fails with ActorNotFound and other times fails with TimeoutException, with the choice of exception being timing-dependent?

It looks like one of the tests actually expects to intercept ActorNotFound while the other intercepts TimeoutException:

- https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/util/AkkaUtilsSuite.scala#L340
- https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/util/AkkaUtilsSuite.scala#L373

Should these tests expect either TimeoutException or ActorNotFound?, not just one of them?

I'll definitely check it. However I didn't have that problem before. 

Thanks [~joshrosen]

You are absolutely right [~joshrosen]. This is due to the inconsistent behaviour of {{Await.result}} and {{resolveOne}} methods. The first one fails with {{TimeoutException}} while the second (in case of timeout) fails with {{ActorNotFoundException}}. I'll fix it right away.

I'm re-opening this issue since we've continued to see this flakiness on AMPLab Jenkins (even after the latest patch), and Typesafe has also run into it in their tests: https://ci.typesafe.com/view/Spark/job/spark-nightly-build/36/testReport/

:(

Closing again https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/4653. Let's hope we won't have to reopen this again.
