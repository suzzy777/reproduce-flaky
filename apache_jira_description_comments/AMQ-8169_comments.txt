It doesn't seem like a problem with the ssl cert. The old cert is a 2048-bit RSA key and looking at the tls handshake the client and server negotiate on TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 as the cipher suite which appears to be a good, strong cipher according to this: [https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/TLS_Cipher_String_Cheat_Sheet.html]

 

I tried generating a new key pair anyway and the test still fails and the cipher suite used is the same:

It's not related to cert: this test is flaky and failing for a while (randomly).

I will check and at least exclude it.

I've been doing some more digging and it appears the intermittent issues we are seeing were introduced in Oracle jdk1.8.0_261. I do not believe this to be a flaky test, but rather a problem with AES GCM. I don't know if it's a JDK bug or if it's an implementation problem.

With Oracle jdk1.8.0_251 the negotiated cipher suite is TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 and I am not able to recreate the test failing.

With Oracle jdk1.8.0_261 the negotiated cipher suite is TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 and I can easily recreate the test failing. The difference in negotiated cipher suite appears to be due to [this change|https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u261-relnotes.html#JDK-8028518] to *Increase the priorities of GCM cipher suites*.

[~tetlucas] interesting the stack and the NIOSSLTransport indicate SSLEngine in use.. I wonder if we need to fix this item (from your JDK changelog notes):

Given all the protocols could share NIOSSLTransport, we should dig in further. Might not be only a STOMP issue.

4. TLS connection issues with applications using javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine

Cause: The internal implementation of the SSLEngine and associated classes has been reworked with the introduction of TLS v1.3 support. Buffer usage has been improved in the SSLEngine area.

Solution: If an SSLEngine application encounters issues after upgrading to JDK 8u261 or later, refer to the Java 8 API to ensure application code is correct. In particular, applications using SSLEngine should not just depend on SSLEngineResult.Status.BUFFER_UNDERFLOW or SSLEngineResult.Status.BUFFER_OVERFLOW results in order to flush pending data. Buffers should always be flushed after an SSLEngine wrap operation if such a call produces data (where SSLEngineResult.Status.OK may be returned).
{noformat}

[~mattrpav], I saw that note in there as well and was going to dig in to it some more! **

It seems likely that's the issue. I added *jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=GCM* to *$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security* and confirmed that even with TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 jdk1.8.0_261 will fail intermittently so it's not specifically a problem with GCM.

Weird, AFAIR, I reproduced the issue with previous JDK 1.8 versions.

Worth to take a look. Anyway, I'm checking with JDK 11 (as I will push the PR about that).

Notes:

1. The secureRead() in the doInit() is needed to maintain connection cycling and connectivity when doing network bridges w/ auto+nio+ssl and other scenarios (see commit history on NIOSSLTransport, confirmed in chat (and his comment to [~tetlucas]'s original PR) w/ @cshannon and unit tests run by [~tetlucas]

2. The secureRead() fail is probably due to multi-threaded access in the not-thread-safe SSLEngine 

-or- 

3. The secureRead() needs improved return code checking out of SSLEngine per the JDK 1.8 updates in item (4) (see comments above)

I think this might be fixed by simply adding synchronized to serviceRead() or maybe just secureRead()

I am testing out a fix now but adding synchronized seems to fix it

AFAIR, I already tried this, but the test sometime failed (less often), but it was maybe a coincidence.

I guess it's valid even using JDK11. I'm asking because I'm ready to update/open the PR about cleanup, JDK11 build and related updates.

Well either way I think it makes sense to synchronize and not use a countdown latch to prevent concurrent access. I'm working on a PR now to make a small change. It seems to fix the issue for me locally so it should at least make it better.

Yes, I agree, it makes sense. I gonna test/check on my machines as well.

Actually I think the countdown latch still makes sense here so I just added the sync and pushed a PR.

AMQ-8169: Synchronize on serviceRead inside NIOSSLTransport

This is needed to prevent concurrent access to the SSLEngine during
initialization. This is a regression from when auto+nio+ssl was added.

FYI - I ran into a deadlock after this fix, I created a new Jira to track the issue to fix it: AMQ-8287

[~cshannon] great! this was a troubling issue to have hang out there.
