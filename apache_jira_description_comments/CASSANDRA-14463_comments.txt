This is a worthy protection to add and the patches look good to me.  +1

I rebased the branches and pushed CI runs:
||Branch||CI|
| [3.0|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...vincewhite:30-no_clobber]|[Jenkins |https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/958/]
|[3.11|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...vincewhite:311-no_clobber]|[Jenkins |https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/957/|]

I guess we should also merge to 4.0 and trunk.
I can help with that if [~VincentWhite] doesn't have the time

Those merge cleanly.

CI looks good, I've added a dtest for this [here|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/tree/CASSANDRA-14463]

[~e.dimitrova] can you review?

In the making... I was actually just preparing to spin the great new test you wrote in the multiplexer to ensure the timeout is enough and the test will not be flaky. :) 

+1 on green [CI |https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1039/workflows/cf8512a6-95fd-4bc7-9e43-fdb6bec9e323/jobs/6189] (the new test is run in the multiplexer to check whether the timeout is enough; I did it only for the 4.0 branch as I wouldn't expect difference for this one between the different branches)

One super nit on the dtest(it can be addressed on commit). Thank you!

Committed w/nit addressed.  Thank you!

[~brandon.williams] [~e.dimitrova] Did the [new dtest|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/commit/3df0ff6e88fcc55bd93e62261a6d7fe869199f6d] for this ever get committed?

Ever? Yes... [now|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/commit/10dd53fcaceabec556f43f67d90dfaf75f2dbbfc].
