Failing test {{TestHiveActionExecutor#testHiveAction()}} is unrelated. FindBugs warnings come from untouched parts. [~gezapeti] can you please review?

+1 
Improving logging is always a good idea. Also Oracle's documentation of waitFor() states that it uses exitCode() by default, but it should be improved by the native implementations.

Thanks for the review [~gezapeti]! Committed to {{master}}.

Closing issue; Oozie 5.0.0 is released.
