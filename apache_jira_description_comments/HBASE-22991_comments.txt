looks like 1.4.12 is already in jira. doing a pass of issues still in 1.4.11 now.

attaching current flaky report. looks okay. {{TestSnapshotFromMaster}} shows a 25% failure rate, but it looks like master not starting up in time for the test.

moved out or resolved things still targeting 1.4.11.

okay the GSON change in HBASE-23015 has landed now and I think that's the last blocker. I'll be back on release process steps this evening.

compared git and jira, made some changes.

h5. Things in jira, but not in git

actually 1.4.10
	* HBASE-21920
	* HBASE-22540

fixed in branch-1 and not 1.4.z
	* HBASE-22495

duplicate with a fix version
	* HBASE-22797
	* HBASE-22901

h5. in git but not jira

mostly back ports

updated jira to set 1.4.11 fix version
	* HBASE-22605
	* HBASE-22629
	* HBASE-22804
	* HBASE-23023

[the flaky test list shows TestShell is failing|https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-1.4/489/artifact/dashboard.html]

createdÂ HBASE-23086 to track the TestShell failure

[~busbey] I committed HBASE-23139 to branch-1.4, that was the last of the Jackson/GSON change side effects that I am aware of. 

excellent. I'll look to pick this up again this weekend.

* booted some things out of 1.4.11 that were recently added as jira fix version but don't have a patch in branch.
* did a check of jira and git. differences are all "backport FOO to branches-1" 
* updated version and CHANGES for RC0

reviewed the compatibility report, some breakage on LimitedPrivate. reopened HBASE-23101 so that we can release note it properly; otherwise things look okay on that front.

my local unit test run passed. ltt almost done.

You might want HBASE-23174, but not critical if we are going to do a 1.4.12.

I'll pull it in, because this is supposed to be it.

Where do we still have jackson? Just rest server?

Yes, hbase-rest

currently todo:

* branch-1.4 backport of HBASE-23174
* update CHANGES
* update staged compat report
* redo hbase-rest build/test with the specific jdk combos I used for the rest of the unit tests
* build RC artifacts

first one going now.

on the last bit.

I have all the RC text drafted. Still working to get artifacts. I keep hitting a failure in javadoc, consistent across three maven versions and two JDK7 versions. will need to dig into things. waiting on a maven run with {{-X}} now.

All of my attempts to build 1.4.11 fail with a CNFE for {{javax.annotations.concurrent.Immutable}}. I manually ran the javadoc command in verbose mode, which gave me a pointer that the class was getting referenced when loading a Guava 12.01 jar. Which reminded me of HBASE-19663, which I've now confirmed is the problem.

:(

RC0 passed : https://s.apache.org/hbase-1.4.11-vote-results

updated dist.a.o and reporter.a.o. will pick up other release activities this weekend.

asf nexus staging repository released

marked 1.4.11 in jira as released.

updated branch-1.4 for release.

pushed the rel/1.4.11 tag

put up PR for website update: https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/756

for whatever reason we haven't previously published HBase 1.4 release docs, so I added them.
{code}
hbase-site busbey$ mkdir 1.4
hbase-site busbey$ tar --strip-components=2 -xzf ~/projects/hbase_project/hbase-releases/hbase-1.4.11/hbase-1.4.11-bin.tar.gz -C 1.4/ hbase-1.4.11/docs/
hbase-site busbey$ git add 1.4
hbase-site busbey$ git commit -m "HBASE-22991 Add 1.4 release docs."
hbase-site busbey$ git commit --allow-empty -m "INFRA-10751 Empty commit"
hbase-site busbey$ git push origin asf-site
{code}

(which works for 1.4 because we still include all of the docs in the binary tarball on that release line)

left to do AFAICT:

* PR 756
* announce email to dev@ and user@
