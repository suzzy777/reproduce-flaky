Lately the number of flaky tests grew. In order to combat this, it was discussed to encourage contributors to run newly added tests multiple number of times before submission. Obviously tests can become flaky over time etc, but this would be a step in the right direction to tackle the increasing number of flaky tests.

To better integrate this into the developer workflow, it would be nice to add this kind of testing to the existing test suite. The main script for building and testing can be found here: 
[https://github.com/apache/kudu/blob/master/build-support/jenkins/build-and-test.sh]

It would be necessary to modify this script, to check if a new test is being added (git show with some filtering), and then run the new test using appropriate setting for --gtest_filter say, for 100 times by running ../../build-support/dist_test.py loop -n 256 -- $test_fpath --stress_cpu_threads=16.
