TestPeerCache is flaky now because it relies on using the same global cache for every test function.  So the cache timeout can't be set to something different for each test.

Also, we should implement equals and hashCode for {{FakePeer}}, since otherwise {{testMultiplePeersWithSameDnId}} is not really testing what happens when multiple equal peers are inserted into the cache.  (The default equals is object equality).
