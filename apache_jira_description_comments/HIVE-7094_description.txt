There are two major places in FileRecordWriterContainer that have the {{if (dynamicPartitioning)}} condition: the constructor and write().

This is the approach that I am taking:

# Move the DP and SP code into two subclasses: DynamicFileRecordWriterContainer and StaticFileRecordWriterContainer.
# Make FileRecordWriterContainer an abstract class that contains the common code for both implementations. For write(), FileRecordWriterContainer will call an abstract method that will provide the local RecordWriter, ObjectInspector, SerDe, and OutputJobInfo.
