Do you have illustration of how the test is failing [~fengchristine]? It is failing because table already exists? If so, should you catch this exception rather than generic IOE in the PR? Thanks for the PR.

It seems we have seen flakies with ReplicationException as same peerId can be used by multiple tests. Hence, it is focusing on ReplicationException.
{code:java}
 catch (IOException e) {
        if (e.getCause() instanceof ReplicationException) {
          continueToRetry = true;
          tries++;
          Uninterruptibles.sleepUninterruptibly(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        }
 }
{code}
Does it sound good [~stack]?

[~stack] Here's some error logs we're seeing:

{{failed after 5 attempts, “org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.ReplicationException: undeleted queue for peerId: region_replica_replication”}}

It seems that when a test attempts to enable or create a table using this "region_replica_replication" peerID, but the previous test using it has not finished closing its tables yet, it causes a ReplicationException, which we should catch, and retry the create/enable table operation until the previous test successfully closes the table and frees up the peerID.

I missed the bit where it was checking for ReplicationException before retry...  I approved the PR. Thanks.

[~fengchristine] PR is merged to master branch. Can you please create PR for branch-2 as it seems to have some differences?

Thanks
