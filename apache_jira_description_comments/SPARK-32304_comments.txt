I don't see this flakiness anymore. Tentatively resolving.

[~dongjoon] This is the issue we just saw in branch-3.0.

 

 

Oh, got it. Thank you, [~andygrove]!

I reopen and convert to a subtask of SPARK-33828 .
If there is no more occurrence during Apache Spark 3.2.0 QA period, we can close this.

let me resolve this. I don;'t see this anymore
