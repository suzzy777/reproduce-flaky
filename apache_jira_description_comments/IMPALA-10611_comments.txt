Hi [~arawat], it looks like test_wide_row becomes flaky after IMPALA-9856 (enable result spooling by default).
I remember changing this test, setting query option max_row_size, but not raising its mem_limit. We should probably add 10MB to the mem_limit to match the max_row_size query option.
I'd like to assign this Jira to myself.

IMPALA-10611: Fix flakiness in test_wide_row

test_wide_row has been intermittently failed with "Failed to allocate
row batch" error message. This is due to recent change in IMPALA-9856
that add query option max_row_size=10MB without raising the mem_limit.
This patch fix the flakiness by increasing the mem_limit from 100 MB to
132 MB to account for 32 MB reservation needed by BufferedPlanRootSink.

Testing:
- Loop the test in local dev machine.
