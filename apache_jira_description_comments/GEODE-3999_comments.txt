pdxrunner opened a new pull request #1078: GEODE-3999: Prevent prematurely running out of heap
URL: https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1078
 
 
   The heap size for test014GemFireServerJvmProcessTerminatesOnOutOfMemoryError
   is marginally increased from 10M to 12M. This should allow sufficient
   memory to start the servers, but not so much that the test takes too long
   to force the OutOfMemoryError.

GEODE-3999: Prevent prematurely running out of heap (#1078)

The heap size for test014GemFireServerJvmProcessTerminatesOnOutOfMemoryError
is marginally increased from 10M to 12M. This should allow sufficient
memory to start the servers, but not so much that the test takes too long
to force the OutOfMemoryError.
