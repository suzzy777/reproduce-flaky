It seems test_strip_leading_comment and test_malformed_query are now flaky due to this issue. I'll work on fixing this for the Shell tests by having each test use a different history file.

Commit bf24a814ccf568fd0f165f05c90488ebc4c2db47 in impala's branch refs/heads/master from [~tlipcon]

IMPALA-6335. Allow most shell tests to run in parallel

This adds an IMPALA_HISTFILE environment variable (and --history_file
argument) to the shell which overrides the default location of
~/.impalahistory for the shell history. The shell tests now override
this variable to /dev/null so they don't store history. The tests that
need history use a pytest fixture to use a temporary file for their
history. This allows so that they can run in parallel without stomping
on each other's history.

This also fixes a couple flaky test which were previously missing the
"execute_serially" annotation -- that annotation is no longer needed
after this fix.

A couple of the tests still need to be executed serially because they
look at metrics such as the number of executed or running queries, and
those metrics are unstable if other tests run in parallel.

I tested this by running:

  ./bin/impala-py.test tests/shell/test_shell_interactive.py \
    -m 'not execute_serially' \
    -n 80 \
    --random

... several times in a row on an 88-core box. Prior to the change,
several would fail each time. Now they pass.
