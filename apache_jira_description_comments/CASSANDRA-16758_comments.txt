Queries in the background can alter stats. It's easy to repro locally by adding a sleep just after starting the thread [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1082/files#diff-c801dfb00bc39ce5bf66a5876779350dba35def185588d13f5e492b6d79212f7R214]. Also printing out the values in the spin assert loop makes that very obvious and visible. Waiting for background cleaning tasks of {{CQLTtester}} is not enough. The equality assert can't be guaranteed but a GTE can.

Passes 1K runs whereas it used to fail.

[~bereng] I noticed this while working on CASSANDRA-16663, and I think I fixed it there, although in a [slightly different|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1045/files#diff-c801dfb00bc39ce5bf66a5876779350dba35def185588d13f5e492b6d79212f7R77] way. Basically, the background queries are from the driver control connections, which we don't actually use for {{ClientResourceLimitsTest}}. My patch for 16663 is obviously only for trunk, but you could use it here, and then I could just rebase my stuff and pick it up when this issue resolves. I think we can avoid relaxing the assertion to GTE...

Indeed getting rid of the driver's interferences without relaxing the assertion sounds like the way to go. Also it seems to fix the occasional failures in other tests in {{ClientResourceLimitsTest}}, like [these ones|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/612/workflows/09dec5a9-2ac4-4595-b455-fce14aa381cf/jobs/6010]. Unfortunately {{testQueryUpdatesConcurrentMetricsUpdate}} seems [flaky|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/613/workflows/693bbc01-eae8-4f56-8298-2811d72892d2/jobs/6015] with both approaches, but we can deal with that in a separate ticket if we think that it's not related.

Using the {{requireNetworkWithoutDriver}} method suggested in CASSANDRA-16663 in 4.0.0 definitely solves all the failures but the one in {{testQueryUpdatesConcurrentMetricsUpdate}}, as it can be seen in [this multiplexer run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/614/workflows/974352fc-a2d7-453e-ae07-002280b9910e/jobs/6020].

Regarding the failure in {{testQueryUpdatesConcurrentMetricsUpdate}}, I think that the creation of the startup message of {{SimpleClient}} is messing with the metrics. We can simply use {{spinAssertEquals}}/{{Awaitility}} to wait until the moment the startup message finishes and the client metric goes back to zero, as it's done [this way|https://github.com/adelapena/cassandra/commit/c0caca66eae1dd388a15cf415ffc25fc37190d2d]. With that change the test survives [5000 runs|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/623/workflows/b69efc53-0e20-4466-a90a-78f162dde54b/jobs/6097].

I agree with you both filtering out driver noise is a superior solution. Also if [~adelapena] managed to get 5K runs for the other failure lurking here then I say +1 to everything after reviewing it and let [~adelapena] commit it. There's no point in me duplicating the effort of building the same PR etc. 

+1 on the [16758-4.0.0-review-caleb|https://github.com/adelapena/cassandra/compare/16758-4.0.0-review-caleb] branch

Andres is OOO but back tomorrow so I'd rather wait for him to be around than hijack his PR in case he had some outstanding work we're not aware of.

Good the concurrent update [failed|http://https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-4.0.0-test-compression/37/jdk=jdk_11_latest,label=cassandra,split=7/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.transport/ClientResourceLimitsTest/testQueryUpdatesConcurrentMetricsUpdate_compression/] today but this should fix it. 2 birds with one stone.

It's good to know that we have a real Jenkins failure for the last fix :)

I don't have any outstanding work besides some trivial warning fixes. The final patch is [here|https://github.com/adelapena/cassandra/commit/506ebff98860a25f76d936a1a1b67b5509189cd4], I'm running the multiplexer [one last time|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/624/workflows/3b758554-0e14-41e7-847b-01da79daf27f] just in case before committing.
