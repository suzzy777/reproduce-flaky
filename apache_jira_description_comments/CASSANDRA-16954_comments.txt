I think before CASSANDRA-16581 these exceptions were just ignored since they weren't ProtocolExceptions but now the catchall is logging this warning and causing the teardown failures. Patch to log native IO errors like these at trace instead.

Yes, I was just hitting this one on node reusage and was about to start looking into it. Thx fo fixing it. LGTM +1. But I would suggest running jvm dtests on 4.0 and trunk to be on the safe side.

The jvm dtests were run above by circle and jenkins.  They're broken on trunk by CASSANDRA-17050, but look good on 4.0.

Committed, appreciate your review!
