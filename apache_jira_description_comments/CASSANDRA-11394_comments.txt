So, based on a quick read of node5's logs, everything seems to be starting up fine. It seems that the startup process is just taking too long and timing out the `wait_other_notice` call. I've filed [a ccm PR|https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm/pull/484] and [a dtest PR|https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/896] to lengthen the timeout.

Filed [this dtest PR|https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/896] to increase the timeout. The idea is this: {{node5}} is supposed to be added to the ring, but the {{wait_other_notice}} call times out. The logs for {{node5}} look fine, so I don't think it's a "node never comes up" problem -- it looks like the timeout just isn't high enough. With new changes to {{ccm}}, this will make the waiting time out for 5 minutes instead of the default 2.


This particular test hasn't flaked in 3 months. I'm willing to close this -- [~philipthompson] [~rhatch]?

Go for it

Not flaking on CassCI lately; closing until further notice.
