Fixed a flaky test case in reservation tests.

ReservationTest.MasterFailover could fail when parameterized with
the 'RESOURCE_PROVIDER' capability. After the simulated master
failover, the re-registered framework could receive an offer before
the re-registered agent sends a 'UPDATE_SLAVE' message. On receiving
this message, the master would rescind the offer and send out a new
one. The test expected a single offer to be send. It has been changed
to accept the first offer and ignore subsequent ones.

Also, the test case has been updated to run with paused clock.
