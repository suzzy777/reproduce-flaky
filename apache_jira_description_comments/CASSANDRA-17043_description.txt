The CircleCI jobs for regular dtests jobs have more resources in MIDRES, which is necessary for some dtests to reliably success. However, the dtest multiplexer uses the same resources for LOWRES and MIDRES.

I think that the dtest multiplexer should always use the same resources as the regular dtests. Using too small resources in the multiplexer can lead to failures that don't reproduce in the regular dtest jobs, like the one we found in [CASSANDRA-16334|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1020/workflows/63908694-e4d7-40b1-9418-7a4b87826233/jobs/9422] when trying to repeatedly run a resource-hungry dtest, or like [this other one|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1020/workflows/63908694-e4d7-40b1-9418-7a4b87826233/jobs/9422] while running {{test_network_topology}}.

This happens because I forgot to update the diff patch when adding the multiplexer. This doesn't affect HIGHRES because in that case the patch changes the configuration of the test executor, while in MIDRES a new executor is defined.
