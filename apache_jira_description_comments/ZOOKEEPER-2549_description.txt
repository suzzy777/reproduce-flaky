As NettyServerCnxn.sendResponse() allows all the exception to bubble up it can stop main ZK requests processing thread and make Zookeeper server look like it is hanging, while it just can not process any request anymore.

Idea is to catch all the exceptions in NettyServerCnxn.sendResponse() , convert them to IOException and allow it propagating up
