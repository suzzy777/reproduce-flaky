GEODE-6685: fix flaky test

The test was asserting that we did more than 100 expirations.
But race conditions exist that allow the test to do exactly 100 expirations.
Since this test is only meant to make sure that expirations are disabled during GII,
I changed the assertion to allow 100 or more expirations.
I also added an assertion that all invalidates should be from expiration.
