[~sopan98] Are you encountering this on your local machine? This test is being run during every PR, every merged commit and also during the nightly build jobs, but it has never been flaky (else it would have been registered in Jira before).

This test depends on the order of iteration in `HashMap.entrySet()` and can fail for some orders. I am running this on my local machine. I have used a maven plugin NonDex, which can be used to identify such tests. One can reproduce it with the command `mvn edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugun:1.1.2:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.co.CoBroadcastWithNonKeyedOperatorTest#testMultiStateSupport`. Even if the test was not failing during the daily jobs, it'd be good to not depend on the `HashMap.entrySet()` that gives back results in an undefined manner [JavaDoc|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html#entrySet--] for this. Therefore, to remove non-determinism completely, we can do this change.

[~chesnay] WDYT?

Sorry but we are busy enough without chasing theoretical test instabilities. Closing this issue and PR.
