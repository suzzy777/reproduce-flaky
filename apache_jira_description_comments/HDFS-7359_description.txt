In a secured cluster, the JournalNode validates that the caller is one of a valid set of principals.  One of the principals considered is that of the SecondaryNameNode.  This involves checking {{dfs.namenode.secondary.http-address}} and trying to interpret it as a network address.  If a user has specified a value for this property that cannot be interpeted as a network address, such as "null", then this causes the JournalNode operation to fail, and ultimately the NameNode cannot start.  The JournalNode should not have a hard dependency on {{dfs.namenode.secondary.http-address}} like this.  It is not typical to run a SecondaryNameNode in combination with JournalNodes.  There is even a check in SecondaryNameNode that aborts if HA is enabled.
