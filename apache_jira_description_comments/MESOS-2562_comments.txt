[~vinod@twitter.com], there is a ticket on Dynamic Reservation Example (MESOS-3063) in my hand (Reviewable); will it also be included in 0.24?

You should work with your shepherd to get it committed. Unfortunately I don't have cycles for reviewing non-HTTP API stuff.

Sure, I'll ping him to get it committed. Thanks.
