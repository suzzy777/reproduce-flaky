Commit 6d1e5b08a74b784786751b1512d6a654fa63c1f1 in geode's branch refs/heads/develop from Owen Nichols

GEODE-6784 increase test timeout from 10->30s

success case for http is observed to sometime take 9.8 seconds on Windows, so 10s timeout seems too short esp for the https case, which is the one that usually fails
