One idea for this on Travis CI is based on CALCITE-2210. In [https://github.com/apache/calcite-avatica/pull/29] I was looking at the Docker Maven images which support JDK 10.

I saw your related https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/649, adding JDK 10 to travis. There are 3 failures:
# PigRelBuilderStyleTest is simply flaky (especially flaky on CI servers, maybe because of fewer available cores)
# missing git command
# different message on IBM JDK

Can you fix #3? For #1 and #2, how about adding {{ENABLE_FLAKY}} in {{CalciteAssert}}, similar to {{ENABLE_SLOW}}, disable those tests with {{assumeTrue}}, and we can run with {{-Dcalcite.test.flaky}} only in interactive environments (e.g. the manual test before a release)?

Thanks for the review [~julianhyde]. I'll take a look and try to fix as you suggested will probably be a few days.

Took a closer look at this. Apache Jenkins supports JDK 10 currently. [https://builds.apache.org/job/Calcite-Master/] JDK 10 is listed in the JDK versions there. JDK 10 builds have been failing due to CALCITE-2225 and SUREFIRE-1439. I'll open a separate issue to fix that. Then I can look at the specific items for enabling JDK 10 on Travis.

 

Opened CALCITE-2237 to fix the Surefire version issue. Opened CALCITE-2238 to look at the pig failures identified since this wasn't on Travis. It failed on my local machine the same way.

[~elserj] - FYI on this one too about trying to get JDK 10 to pass :)

Looks like just waiting on CALCITE-2253 to be fixed and then can update PR [https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/649]. 

 

[~elserj] - Minus the failures from CALCITE-2253 I'm pretty sure that JDK 10 builds are working now.

Opened CALCITE-2254 to add to Travis CI testing against IBM Java. Will open a specific Jira to address the IBM Java error message parsing.

[~elserj] - All JDK 10 tests are passing if you want to reenable JDK 10 on Jenkins

[~julianhyde] - FYI [https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/649] all tests pass (JDK 8, 9, and 10) with updated .travis.yml so ready for review.

Fixed in [https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=calcite.git;a=commit;h=9085b601081689b5b7f1e9f57deb20e2229910cb.] Thanks Kevin!

[~elserj] - Pretty sure this Jira is complete. Only thing left is to reenable the Calcite JDK 10 jobs on Apache Jenkins. Can you take care of that?
