yes; this test have interfered with some of my runs as well lately; should we disable it?

I'm not familiar with this test case, but we should choose a way to go:
1. @RunWith retry logic (best effort, doesn't solve the original problem) on AllocatorOutOfMemoryException
2. review the resource needs for this job and change infra accordingly
3. disable test
what do you think [~bslim]?
