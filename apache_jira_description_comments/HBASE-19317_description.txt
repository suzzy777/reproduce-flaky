YARN (2.7.4, at least) defaults to asserting at least 10% of the disk usage free on the local machine in order for the NodeManagers to function.

On my development machine, despite having over 50G free, I would see the warning from the NM that all the local dirs were bad which would cause the test to become stuck waiting to submit a mapreduce job. Surefire would eventually kill the process.

We should increase this value to avoid it causing us headache.
