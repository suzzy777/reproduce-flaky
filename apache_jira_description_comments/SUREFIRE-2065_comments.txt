This issue also causes @ParameterizedTest [name|https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.params/org/junit/jupiter/params/ParameterizedTest.html#name()] to have no effect in junit 5 tests right?
{code:java}
public static Stream<String> params() {
  return Stream.of("Hello World");
}
@ParameterizedTest(name = "{index}: {0}")
@MethodSource("params")
public void test(String param) {} {code}
Expected: test(String)[1: Hello World]
Actual: test(String)[1]

When creating the reports it seems that the need is to have a unique way of identifying the test being executed. If the test executed does not have a unique identifier then other problems would come up (what caused the initial issue here). It would mistakenly consider multiple tests to be one leading to other problems.

I am not 100% sure when this 'displayName' should be used (other than in your IDE when running the tests) ... maybe the log should show with proper display name, but I am still seeing the unique name instead, so this may still be a problem even after this fix

PR merged. Thanks
