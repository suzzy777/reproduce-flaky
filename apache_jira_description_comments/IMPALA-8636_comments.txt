IMPALA-8636: Implement INSERT for insert-only ACID tables

This commit adds INSERT support for insert-only ACID tables.

The Frontend opens a transaction for INSERT statements when the target
table is transactional. It also allocates a write ID for the target
table. The Frontend aborts the transaction if an error occurs during
analysis/planning.

The Backend gets the transaction id and the write id in TFinalizeParams.
The write id is also set the for the HDFS table sinks. The sinks write
the files at their final destination which is an ACID base or delta
directory. There is no need for finalization of transactional INSERTS.

When the sinks finished with writing the data, the Coordinator invokes
updateCatalog() on catalogd which also commits the transaction if
everything went well, otherwise the Coordinator aborts the transaction.

Testing:
* added new tables during dataload
* added acid-insert.test file with INSERT statements against the new
  tables
* test insertions between ACID and non-ACID tables
* test error scenarios via debug actions
* added integration test with Hive to test_hms_integration.py. The test
  inserts data with Impala and reads with Hive. (These integration
  tests only run with exhaustive exploration strategy)

TODO in following commits:
* add locks and heartbeats (without heartbeats long-running transactions
  might be aborted by HMS)
* implement TRUNCATE
* CTAS creates files in the 'root' directory of the table/partition. It
  is handled correctly during SELECT, but would be better to create a
  base directory from the beginning. Hive creates a delta directory
  for CTAS.

[~boroknagyz] Any user-facing doc impact?

[~arodoni_cloudera] do we have any documentation about Impala's ACID support?
{noformat}
git grep -i acid{noformat}
showed no results in the 'docs' directory. I think we should have at least some short description about what ACID is and what Impala supports.

(Impala currently only supports querying from and inserting to insert-only ACID tables.)

[~boroknagyz] I am about to start documenting the ACID table support. So, in 3.3, Impala only supports inserting into already existing Hive insert-only ACID table?

Impala will only support insert-only ACID tables. It means Impala can create, query, and insert such tables. These are implemented already on the master branch.

However, there's chance that Impala won't be able to drop (despite it can create), alter, or truncate such tables. There's active development on those features so we'll see if they can land before the release.

IMPALA-8636: fix flakiness of ACID INSERT tests

I had to add @UniqueDatabase.parametrize(sync_ddl=True) to some e2e
tests because they were broken in exhaustive mode. When the tests run
with sync_ddl=True then the test files are executed against multiple
impalads which means that each statement in the .test file is executed
against a random impalad.
