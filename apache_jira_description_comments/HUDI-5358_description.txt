In the tests, the {{KEEP_LATEST_COMMITS}} cleaner policy is used. This policy first figures out the earliest commit to retain based on the config of the number of retained commits ({{{}hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained{}}}). Then, for each file group, one more version before the earliest commit to retain is also kept from cleaning. The commit for the version can be different among file groups. 

However, the current validation logic only statically picks the one commit before the earliest commit to retain in the Hudi timeline for all file groups, which does not match the {{KEEP_LATEST_COMMITS}} cleaner policy.
