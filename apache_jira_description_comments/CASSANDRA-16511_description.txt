When running unit tests with parallel execution we may sometimes notice the port collision. In this mode, test classes from the list get consecutive offsets which are added to native transport port, storage port and ssl storage port ( {{OffsetAwareConfigurationLoader}} ). However we add to the ports configured in {{test/conf/cassandra.yaml}} we as we can see we have the following default config:
{code:java}
storage_port: 7012
ssl_storage_port: 7011 {code}
This results in the situation that thread n has the same storage port as thread n+1 has ssl storage port. There are not much such tests, but we can see {{ConnectionTests}} failing frequently because of that. 

The other problem is that {{OffsetAwareConfigurationLoader}} does not adjust native transport ssl port.
