Thanks for the contribution [~txsing]! Seems like a valuable addition to the rerun functionality.

Can you please address failing pre-commit issues in {{RAW_PATCH_ANALYSIS}}, {{JAVADOC}}, and {{FINDBUGS_DIFF}} sections? Thanks!

[~txsing] any chance you've time to finish this fix?

[~txsing], do you have any plans to continue this issue? I would take it over if you have other priorities.

[~asalamon74] Please review it . The failing pre-commit issues looks unrelated.

[~zuston], can you please upload your patch to ReviewBoard?

Thanks [~kmarton]. The ReviewBoard link is [https://reviews.apache.org/r/70931/diff/1/]

Thank you [~zuston]! I have left some comments on the RB. 

[~zuston], please upload the new patch here as well, to trigger the precommit job. 

Also please cover the new feature with test cases and update the documentation as well (DG_CoordinatorRerun.md)
