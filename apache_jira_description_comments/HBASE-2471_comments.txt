How would the region get removed between the RS failure and the HM splitting the logs? Don't the regions need to be assigned in order for the table to be dropped or a split to happen?

HLog files contain edits for all regions on a particular RegionServer.  HLogs get GC'd only after all edits in a file have been persisted.   HLogs may stick around a good while if any one of a RS's Regions is a laggard flushing.  While the HLog lives, some other Region X may have split and been removed, and then the RS crashed.  On replay, we'll trip over Region X's edits though Region X had been removed.

Good point, I was thinking that pre-split the region would be flushed, and thus the logs would be expired. But the logs could have records for other unflushed regions.

Bulk move of 0.20.5 issues into 0.21.0 after vote that we merge branch into TRUNK up on list.

Should be easy fix.  From j-d "If regiondir does not exist, do not create a recovered.edits file... skip"... In split logs need to keep a list of non-existent regions tooo...  so we don't check fs for each encountered edit.

Patch that I'm about to commit. It's different from what I posted on RB because some other unit tests needed to be changed and only figured it out when running the full test suite.

Committed patch to trunk. It expect some sort of destabilization as some tests looked flaky when I ran the full suite, so I might have to fix more tests in the near future.
