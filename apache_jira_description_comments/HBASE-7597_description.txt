I ran the entire test suite many times and always failed on, at least, testRegionShouldNotBeDeployed.

Results below. I will attached more result when current tests are done.

Failed tests:
testDeleteExpiredStoreFiles(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestStore):
expected:<2> but was:<4>
  testAcquireTaskAtStartup(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestSplitLogWorker):
Waiting timed out after [1 000] msec
  testRegionShouldNotBeDeployed(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.TestHBaseFsck):
expected:<[SHOULD_NOT_BE_DEPLOYED]> but was:<[]>
  testPermissionsWatcher(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.access.TestZKPermissionsWatcher)
