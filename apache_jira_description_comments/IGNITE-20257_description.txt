Test ItCliServiceTest#testSnapshot become flaky, sometimes it fails on trying {{CliService#snapshot.}}

The reason of fails is the fact that {{CliService}} support retrying network calls in case of not availability, and when we call {{ClientService#connect}} it is possible that some nodes are not accessible. As a solution, we could eat for all nodes to establish connection between each other
