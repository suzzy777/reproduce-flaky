If we have more buckets per region than default value is_, show metrics_ command per server has wrong stats for *totalBucketCount* and *totalPrimaryCount*. Number of buckets is good if _show metric_s is executed region by region per server.

It looks like it doesn't take last updated results when print output.

After last bucket are created it increase these two values but in output we have a value before that increase.

To reproduce an issue:
 # Run locator and 4 servers.
 # create partition persistent region with total-num-buckets more than default value
 # do query (_query --query="select * from /region1"_)
 # Repeat steps 2. and 3. to create and query more regions
 # see result of show metrics per server and region by region per server
