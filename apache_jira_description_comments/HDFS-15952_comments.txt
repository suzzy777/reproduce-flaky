Both tests fail after disabling the default namespace.

versionRequest and getTransactionID are both invoked from RouterRpcServer#invokeAtAvailableNs on the first available namespace if the default namespace is disabled, which I think the cause of the flakiness.

"The first available namespace" does not always point to the same namespace as the one nnNamenodeProtocol is pointing to.

I think I fixed it as part of HDFS-15988.

[~aajisaka] check If you can extract the code from there, and polish. Might save some efforts. :)

Thank you [~ayushtkn]. Your change looks similar to that of mine. I'll update the PR.

Merged the PR into trunk and branch-3.3.
