After fixing the false positive precommit reports in OOZIE-3317, if there are some kind of errors during junit execution, the following information is printed out: 

{color:#FF0000}-1 TESTS{color}
There were errors during execution. Check console output for details.

It should be useful to have the concrete errors printed out as well. In order to avoid the very long reports in case of lots of failures, we should limit the printed out errors to a specific number (5)/module.
