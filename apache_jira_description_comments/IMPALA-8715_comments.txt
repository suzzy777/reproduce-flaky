Yeah, the test_observability ones were definitely because of the load time not showing up in the profile with the local catalog enabled.

Seems like test_refresh_partition_num_rows is still flaky. Failed this job (the change was unrelated):

cc: [~stigahuang] since he also tracking the work needed to enable local-catalog by default.

Seems like that test consistently fails on that change for some reason:

Sorry, it was my bad. I had a global invalidate metadata in a parallel test...
