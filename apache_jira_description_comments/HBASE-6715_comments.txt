Is this a fix or more debug to find why the fail?  I'm +1 on commit in either case.

Thanks for the review.  This is a little clean up. My guess is that the executor service is not shutdown completely.  However, I could not reproduce it, so I just added some checking to make sure the cache hit count is stabilized before moving ahead, which should have fix the issue, unless the cache is still in use after quite some time.

Want to commit this and leave the issue open?  We can wait some time and if we think the prob. nailed, then close it?

Sure, committed it to trunk and 0.94. We will see if the issue is gone.

I haven't seen it fails recently. Let's reopen it if it fails again.
