GEODE-5420: Protect events in HAContainer from premature modification

- Updated putInProgress boolean in HAWrapper to a counter to prevent prematurely setting ClientUpdateMessage to null when events are temporarily queued during a GII or message dispatcher initialization
- decAndRemoveFromHAContainer only removes when putInProgress counter and ref count are 0
- Refactored putEventInHARegion/putConditionallyInHAContainer to prevent overwriting an existing entry in the HAContainer.  Also reduces simplifies the code and reduces duplicated logic.
- Wrote missing basic HARegionQueue unit/integration tests, and an integration test to capture setting the ClientUpdateMessage property on HAEventWrapper to null prematurely
- Added new event tracing messages at debug logging level to help track similar issues in the future
