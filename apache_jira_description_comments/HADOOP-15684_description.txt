When name node call triggerActiveLogRoll, and the cachedActiveProxy is a dead name node, it will throws a ConnectTimeoutException, expected behavior is to try next NN, but current logic doesn't do so, instead, it keeps trying the dead, mistakenly take it as active.

 Attachment is a log file saying how it repeatedly retries a dead name node, and a fix patch.

 I replaced the actual machine name/ip as SourceMachine001/SourceIP001 and TargetMachine001/TargetIP001.

 

How to Repro:

In a good running NNs, take down the active NN (don't let it come back during test), and then the stand by NNs will keep trying dead (old active) NN, because it is the cached one.
