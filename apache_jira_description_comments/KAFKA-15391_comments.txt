Hmm, similar but seems different

[~ocadaruma] It is a bit different from the perspective that the race condition is not with retention threads but instead between two async segment roll and request handler thread, but the fix is same. We shouldn't be erroring out if the file that we want to delete doesn't exist.

I see, understood. Thanks

May I take this ticket?

I'm interested since this issue may also happen on our cluster (3.3.2) so I'm happy to solve that. I can submit a patch today

Yes please [~ocadaruma] go ahead. Please note that there might be side-effects to changing Utils.delete i.e. what if there is another code which is relying on Utils.delete to throw a file not found exception. When making a change, please ensure that there is no such code. If there is we can probably add a new Utils.deleteIfExists function and use the new function at the places where we encounter this bug.

For this issue, we may need to swallow NoSuchFileException in Utils.flushDir but yeah I'll check the usage and add another method instead of changing existing one if necessary
