It looks flaky because build #2015, the next one, worked with a single change that looks unrelated. Like https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/IMPALA-3272, this could be because the test just before is failing. In this case, that test is custom_cluster/test_query_expiration.py.

[~henryr], [~lv], this might be related to https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/IMPALA-3327.
