GEODE-5555: Add 'devBuild' task (#2293)

* devBuild depends on :assembly and :spotlessApply
* Ensure that spotlessApply and spotlessCheck run before compilation
*** This ordering dependency is project wide, not only with respect to
devBuild
* Correct apparent error in precheckin task only running
acceptanceTest task in geode-assembly module
*** Historically, this was the only module that contained
acceptanceTests.  This was changed with the introduction of nebula
facets.
* Minor readability improvements in touched files.
