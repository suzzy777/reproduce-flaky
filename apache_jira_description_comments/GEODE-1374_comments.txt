GEODE-1374: Run flaky tests in a separate gradle task

Add a new test task specifically for running tests annotated with
@FlakyTest.  This allows us to isolate tests that exhibit
intermittent failures.  Other changes include:

- Exclude flaky tests from test, integrationTest, uiTest, and
  distributedTest tasks
- Cleanup how tests are found using the minimum set of
  include/exclude categories
