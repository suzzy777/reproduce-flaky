This issue is not captured by the automatic test runs in https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-2.0-jdk8. It is hard to debug this without having stacktrace.

Given that the test is related to Sasal and it passes most of the time, for the same reason as explained in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7651, this does not appear to be a blocking issue for 2.1.0 release.
