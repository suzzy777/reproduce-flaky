In {{HRegion.setRecovering()}} we have this code:

{code}
    // force a flush only if region replication is set up for this region. Otherwise no need.
      boolean forceFlush = getTableDesc().getRegionReplication() > 1;

      // force a flush first
      MonitoredTask status = TaskMonitor.get().createStatus(
        "Flushing region " + this + " because recovery is finished");
      try {
        if (forceFlush) {
          internalFlushcache(status);
        }
{code}

So we only optionally force flush after a recovery of a region, but the message always is set to "Flushing...", which might be confusing. We should change the message based on {{forceFlush}}.
