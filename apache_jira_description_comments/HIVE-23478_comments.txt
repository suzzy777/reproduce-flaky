I've attempted to fix the issue by making the database unique. I've changed the database used from
{code:java}
db~!@#$%^&*(),<>{code}
to
{code:java}
db~!@@#$%^&*(),<>{code}
(I've added an extra @)

I also hit this flaky test in one of my patches. Failure I saw was following :
{code}
java.lang.AssertionError: 
Client Execution succeeded but contained differences (error code = 1) after executing special_character_in_tabnames_quotes_1.q 
15534c15534
<  1 	4	2
---
>  1	4	2
{code}

I dont think using unique name will suffice. Issue seems to be order of rows in test output. It probably needs fix similar to HIVE-23484

[~ashutoshc] I was just looking at that one, I do believe that is the correct approach. I'm going to suggest making the DB name on that patch unique also. I had seen problems running both test together locally which I surmised to be the DB name, but I didn't repro the ordering formatting change due to order. I'll abandon this one.

Closing as duplicate of HIVE-23484

Actually, I think I confused myself with similar named tests. I'll update this patch with the ordering change.

Doing both won't hurt and makes test more resilient. So, can add unique name as well as order by.
