Slow datanode metrics include slow node and it's reporting node details. With HDFS-16582, we added the aggregate latency that is perceived by the reporting nodes.

In order to get more insights into how the outlier slownode's latencies differ from the rest of the nodes, we should also expose median, median absolute deviation and the calculated upper latency limit details.
