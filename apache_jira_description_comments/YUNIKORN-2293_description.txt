If an E2E test fails, we will dump the cluster status through the following functions:
 # [test/e2e/wrappers.go#LogTestClusterInfoWrapper()|https://github.com/apache/yunikorn-k8shim/blob/master/test/e2e/wrappers.go#L96]
 # [test/e2e/wrappers.go#LogYunikornContainer()|https://github.com/apache/yunikorn-k8shim/blob/master/test/e2e/wrappers.go#L129]

However, these log functions contain several assertions, and a failed assertion will block other cleanup steps in AfterEach. Incomplete cleanup can cause other E2E tests to fail.
 
For example, E2E test ([#967|https://github.com/apache/yunikorn-k8shim/actions/runs/7356744028/job/20027836104#step:6:11373]) failed due to a [flaky assert |https://github.com/apache/yunikorn-k8shim/actions/runs/7356744028/job/20027836104#step:6:972] in gang scheduling. The afterEach status have no application in queue, which caused an [assert function|https://github.com/apache/yunikorn-k8shim/blob/master/test/e2e/wrappers.go#L112-L113] failed.  Furthermore, the incompleted resources cleanup caused the following E2E tests to fail as well:
 * simple_preemptor
 * state_aware_app_scheduling
 * user_group_limit

We should remove the assertions in those dump functions and just purely log the error messages.
