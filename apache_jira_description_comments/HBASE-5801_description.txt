Recently, we encountered a case where some regions in a table have different HTableDescriptor settings serialized into HDFS their HRegionInfo .regioninfo file.  hbck expects all HTDs within a table to be the same and currently bails out in this situation.

We need to either point out a proper set of actions for the user to execute or automatically convert the region to a common HTD (likely the most common on, or possibly the "first one".)

Not sure if this requires reformatting data but may require closing and restarting a region.

This issue is hbase 0.90.x specific -- 0.92+ keep all table info in a single .tableinfo file.
