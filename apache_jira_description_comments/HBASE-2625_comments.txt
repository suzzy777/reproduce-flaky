Note that I think I also addressed the testDynamicBloom() flakiness in Hudson as well and documented the test assumptions a little better.  If the keyCount exceeds 2000 keys, 3 blooms will be created.  This will increase the theoretical error rate to 6*keyInterval*err, which is higher than the tolerance.  Only a couple lines in 1 file, so I didn't think it was big enough to slap in review board.

Applied.  Thanks Nicolas (Do we even use DynamicBloomFilters?)

We don't use Dynamic blooms right now.  We can take them out as dead code.  The random (vs. mod 2) test might be good to keep in and switch from using dynamic blooms to static blooms.

OK Nicolas.  I'm going to cut Dynamic blooms especially as they seem to fail up in hudson sometimes: http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/HBase-TRUNK/1282/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util/TestByteBloomFilter/testDynamicBloom/



Did you cut dynamic blooms or all the bloom tests?  I can't see TestByteBloomFilter.java in the trunk.  You could change testDynamicBloom() to use a static bloom instead and rename to 'testRandomEntries' or something like that.

@Nicolas Here is what I did: HBASE-2653  I removed the filter and the test that used it.

Integrated in HBase-TRUNK #2838 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/2838/])
    HBASE-2625 Avoid byte buffer allocations when reading a value from a Result object (Tudor Scurtu) (Revision 1333159)

     Result = SUCCESS
