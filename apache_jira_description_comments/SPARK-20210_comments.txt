Are you sure it's due to PPC? or just a flaky test?
BTW I'm not sure we would consider PPC supported, so I won't mark this is as a bug. However if there are simple ways to make it just work, that's fine.

[~srowen] , its not a flaky test. Although I am not sure whether its due to the PPC arch. I have tested it on both ppc64le and x86 arch. The tests ran and passed on the x86 platform.

I run the following two tests (DatasetCacheSuite and CachedTableSuite) with Ubuntu 16.04 / java 1.8.0_111. However, I did not see this exception.
