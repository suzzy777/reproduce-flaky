Merged into trunk. Now checking the qbt builds and trying to backport to the other branches.

Backported to branch-3.3.

Backported to branch-3.2.

Hey [~aajisaka]

Seems this yetus upgrade has changed couple of things, guess the PR's are not having comments with result and I think this stuff surfaced before and we solved it by using some commit HASH from yetus, I think having comments is good, helps in history keeping as well.

Can we get that behaviour back?

Since there are no option to add a comment in GitHub PR in Yetus 0.13.0, we cannot get that behavior back. Should we create an issue in YETUS to add that option?

Filed YETUS-1102 and created a PR.

Thanx [~aajisaka] for taking that up. Once that is in, we will use the commit hash in our code. :)

Do let me know if I can be of any help

Fixed by HADOOP-17570. Thanks.

Hey [~aajisaka],

Seems the comment stuff isn't working, I checked a couple of recent PR's

[https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2763]

[https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2762]

 

Do we need to pass the parameter somewhere in the job as well?

Maybe the GitHub token is expired. Created a draft PR to check: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2765

The GitHub App token expires in only 1 hour, and most of the builds are affected in Hadoop. 

[https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps#token-based-identification]

I think there are 2 ways to fix it:
 * Add comments in GitHub Status recovery tool (YETUS-1059)
 * Use the GitHub OAuth token instead. (However, it will disable updating GitHub Statuses.)

I'll check if we can use the GitHub OAuth token.

GitHub OAuth token seems good: [https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2766]

Filed HADOOP-17582 to fix.

Backported to branch-3.1.

Backported to branch-2.10 via https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/3832
