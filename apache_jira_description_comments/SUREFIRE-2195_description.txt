The issue has been discussed in the [Maven mailing list|https://lists.apache.org/thread/6k10kmxzz75rz8mqn3pl1ltvfltw87m9]. I am creating a bug here as suggested in the mailing list

Cross-posting it here for completeness

My {{junit-platform.properties}} looks like below


{code:java}
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.strategy=fixed
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=8
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default=same_thread
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default=concurrent
{code}

I am observing the surefire reports that are getting generated are not correct

I have a test class named {{com.spotnana.servicetests.backoffice.invoicing.AirInvoiceServiceTest}} contains just a single test, {{testAirTicketing()}}.

But in the report file,  TEST-com.spotnana.servicetests.backoffice.invoicing.AirInvoiceServiceTest.xml. 

I see like below


{code:xml}
<testsuite xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/xsd/surefire-test-report-3.0.xsd" version="3.0" name="com.spotnana.servicetests.backoffice.invoicing.AirInvoiceServiceTest" time="44.711" tests="2" errors="1" skipped="0" failures="0”>

…

  <testcase name="testCrossPnrRefund" classname="com.spotnana.servicetests.analytics.ingestion.pnr.AirServiceTest" time="5.789"/>
  <testcase name="testAirTicketing" classname="com.spotnana.servicetests.backoffice.invoicing.AirInvoiceServiceTest" time="33.331”>
{code}

It seems to be picking tests from some other class like {{AirServiceTest}} as in this case.

The console logs are also not correct. Please check the attached screenshot. In the attached screenshot of the console logs, it is saying {{Test Run 5}} but the {{AirInvoiceServiceTest}} contains only 1 test. And also the report shows random data. For example, sometimes it says {{Test Run 5}} , sometimes it says {{Test Run 2}}, etc.

I am observing it as part of a big project consistently with every run. I am trying to reproduce it in a small example. If I am able to do I will share it. In the mean time if some debug logs are needed, let me know I will be happy to share them.

Junit5 Version - 5.9.3

I am observing the issue with Junit5 Version 5.10.0 also. I tried reducing the {{junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism}} to 3 but there also I am getting the same problem.
