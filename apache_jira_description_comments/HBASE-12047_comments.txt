LGTM overall for branch1+. 

When do we use CellUtil.estimatedLengthOf() vs KeyValueUtil.length() ? 
{code}
-      for (Cell kv : results) {
-        totalSize += KeyValueUtil.ensureKeyValue(kv).getLength();
+      for (Cell cell : results) {
+        totalSize += KeyValueUtil.length(cell);
       }
{code}

Time to do a Cell.Type instead of KV.Type (something to consider for another jira)? 
{code}
-        if (type == MutationType.DELETE || (type == MutationType.PUT && CellUtil.isDelete(kv))) {
-          KeyValue.Type keyValueType = KeyValue.Type.codeToType(kv.getType());
+        if (type == MutationType.DELETE || (type == MutationType.PUT && CellUtil.isDelete(cell))) {
+          KeyValue.Type keyValueType = KeyValue.Type.codeToType(cell.getTypeByte());
           valueBuilder.setDeleteType(toDeleteType(keyValueType));
{code}

Thanks [~enis]
bq.When do we use CellUtil.estimatedLengthOf() vs KeyValueUtil.length() ?
As you know the CellUtil method is just an estimate. The places in the HFileWriter area where we write Cells with KV serialization, we must use the KeyValueUtil method. This has to be exact length.  In many other places, we calculate the length for metric reporting etc. There we can just use estimatedLengthOf IMO.  The above sample you showed is metric related. I think I can change to estimatedLengthOf. Good Q and good catch.

bq.Time to do a Cell.Type instead of KV.Type (something to consider for another jira)? 
Yes another good clean up. We can do in another Jira.

I was looking at this today.  Can we just move out Type to be its own class referenced by KV and Cell?  We won't have issue deserializing ?  We'll need to test.

bq. Can we just move out Type to be its own class referenced by KV and Cell? 
+1.   BTW Call it CellType ?
bq.We won't have issue deserializing ? 
Should not be IMO.

Small change from V2 and use estimatedLengthOf(Cell) for metric purpose.
Let us see what QA reports. Many tests seems flaky!
