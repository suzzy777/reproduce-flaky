Thanks for reporting this. You're right.

Just assigned to you, please go ahead.

merge [ab41e4f4|https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/ab41e4f4f1406ca349f0407cbbe05e0647132c81] into master

[~masteryhx] The Jira issue is labeled with 1.17.1 as the affected version. This would assume that we should create backports for older version (and 1.18), shouldn't we?

This is just a simple improvement to make this UT case more reasonable which doesn't affect the main code path and CI.

So I think it's fine that we just resolved it in the master.

Ok, thanks for the clarification :)
