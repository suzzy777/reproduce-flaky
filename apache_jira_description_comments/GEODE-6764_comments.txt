GEODE-6764: Fix tests broken and flaky on Windows (#3577)


- ExportConfigCommandTest was broken by refactorings around removing
  LegacyCommandResult.
- AvailablePortHelperIntegrationTest has always been flaky on Windows.
  By default, Windows uses a bunch more ports than Linux, so some of
  these tests just don't work reliably as larger port ranges are not
  open and available on Windows.
