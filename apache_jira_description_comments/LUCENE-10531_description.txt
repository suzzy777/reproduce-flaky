We are going to allow running the test on Xvfb (a virtual display that speaks X protocol) in [LUCENE-10528], this tweak is available only on Linux.

I'm just guessing but it could confuse or bother also Mac and Windows users (we can't know what window manager developers are using); it may be better to make it opt-in by marking it as slow tests. 
Instead, I think we can enable a dedicated Github actions workflow for the distribution test that is triggered only when the related files are changed. Besides Linux, we could run it both on Mac and Windows which most users run the app on - it'd be slow, but if we limit the scope of the test I suppose it works functionally just fine (I'm running actions workflows on mac and windows elsewhere).

To make it "slow test", we could add the same {{@Slow}} annotation as the {{test-framework}} to the distribution tests, for consistency.
