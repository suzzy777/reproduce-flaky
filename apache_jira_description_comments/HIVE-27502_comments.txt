The mention of HIVE-27475 in the description is a bit misleading. It is not HIVE-27475 that fixed the flakiness; HIVE-27475 just made things working again. I guess we still don't know what was the source of flakiness to begin with but as far as it concerns the flaky checker if it passes now 
we can enable it back.

Fixed in [https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/8ea1d78d0dc18fec4305dd0d0a9e341ecdcaef1e.] Thanks [~akshatm] for the PR and [~aturoczy]Â  for the review!
