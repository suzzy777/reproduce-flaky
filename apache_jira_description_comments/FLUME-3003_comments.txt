[~denes]: thank you for the patch!

The change looks good to me. (It would be better if we didn't have to do the sleep(), but I found no easy way to do that.)

I'll leave some time for other people to review it. If nobody has any improvement ideas, I'll commit this tomorrow.

I'm about to commit this

Commit 27c725802b16915acaa3ea05cdac0236972af1f0 in flume's branch refs/heads/trunk from [~denes]

FLUME-3003. Fix flaky testSourceCounter in TestSyslogUdpSource

The event processing in SyslogUDPSource is handled on a separate thread by Netty so message delivery, thus the sourceCounter's increment can be delayed resulting in a flaky test.

This patch fixes that issue by adding more delay when necessary.
