The (integration) tests related to autoscaling nodeAdd/nodeLost trigger's and restoring their state are problematic for a lot of reasons.

Beyond some silly implementation mistakes, a fundemental timing/concurrency issue is that (as designed) the tests have no way to ensure that "after" creating a nodeAdded/nodeLost situation, they can wait for the (first instance of) the trigger to run() and detect the situation (recording it in the trigger's internal state) so that the test can subsequently "update" the trigger, forcing a new instance to restore the old state and then execute the trigger actions.  This can result i na lot of flaky-ness if the triggers don't run when "expected"
