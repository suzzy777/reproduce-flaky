The PortableRunner doesn't pass custom PipelineOptions to the executing Runner.

Example: {{--parallelism=4}} won't be forwarded to the FlinkRunner.
(The option is just removed during proto translation without any warning)

We should allow some form of customization through the options, even for the PortableRunner.
