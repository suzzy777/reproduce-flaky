See the discussion at the tail of HBASE-17123 where Appy pointed out that the override of loaded should be placed inside else block:
{code}
      } else {
        // secure bulk load
        map = regionServer.secureBulkLoadManager.secureBulkLoadHFiles(region, request);
      }
      BulkLoadHFileResponse.Builder builder = BulkLoadHFileResponse.newBuilder();
      if (map != null) {
        loaded = true;
      }
{code}
This issue is to address the review comment.

After several review iterations, here are the changes:

* Return value of boolean for postBulkLoadHFile() hook are changed to void.
* Coprocessor hooks (pre and post) are added for the scenario where bulk load manager is used.
