SOLR-16911: Remove ability to change hostContext, keep it as /solr (#1810)

* add warning if a user has a hostContext defined in solr.xml.
* eradicates all usage of hostContext in the code, replacing it with hardcoded /solr.
* remove randomization of hostContext in tests that extend BaseDistributedSearchTestCase

I was brushing up on how "hostContext" used to work for some changes I'd like to make in SOLR-17044, and stumbled across this change.  Two thoughts, a couple months in to having this:

1. git-grep still shows a few usages of the "hostContext" string-literal still around.  The two main ones look to be in "solr/server/contexts/solr-jetty-context.xml", and as an unused ctor param for MiniSolrCloudCluster.  I'm assuming both of these were just oversights.  Happy to remove them if you can confirm [~epugh]?
2. On 'main', we now ignore 'hostContext' but log a warning when it's present.  Wdyt about putting a similar warning in on branch_9x - we would still obey the property for those versions, but it'd at least give users a way to notice the deprecation a little earlier.  (Personally I'm a little worried that some users do use this feature in their deployments.  Better those folks discover it sooner when there's still time to make their case prior to 10.0, than for them to discover it once 10 is already out the door.) 

I thought I had purged them, but clearly not.  So yes, please eliminate the remaining hostContext.   

As far as a backward warning to 9, well, we've talked about it in the dev list, there has been more then one ticket to call out this change, and that I would think that a migration to Solr 10 will be a good time to change your deployment strategy.  However, I am sure that giving them a warning would be a nice thing if it doesn't complicate our code much!

Created a PR to remove that one dangling hostContext reference [here|https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2052].

I also looked briefly at adding a warning to 9.x for folks using 'hostContext', but it looks like "hostContext" doesn't even work as intended there (at at least, as I thought was intended).  On both branch_9x and branch_9_4, setting "hostContext" in solr.xml updates a few things (e.g. the /live_nodes entry in ZK), but it doesn't impact the URL for hitting Solr's APIs in any way.  v1 APIs were still exposed under "/solr".  (I did get the API path to change eventually by changing a hard-coded value in "solr/server/contexts/solr-jetty-context.xml".  I wonder whether the expectation had always been that the "hostContext" value in solr.xml was always meant to go along with hand-edits to Jetty config files.  I couldn't find any docs on how this was initially conceived to work...)

Anyway, it's probably not worth adding an extra log message to highlight the deprecation for any hostContext users on 9x, given that hostContext doesn't work on that branch!
