 The initial delay to schedule HMSFollower being 60000 ms is too long, and the test may finish before HMSFollower first calls run(). This problem exists before my change in sentry-1649. Since I have moved scheduling HMSFollower to runServer(), this long delay makes it worse. I have reduced it to 600 ms. Then another issue pops up. When the first full snapshot has nothing, a default AuthzObj is created in sentrystore. when the second full snapshot has nothing, we have "SentryAlreadyExistsException: AuthzObj: default already exists". So I move the code for setting needHiveSnapshot to constructor.

[~akolb] I believe sentry-1649 has fixed it. The time to wait in test is the (initial delay + 2 * polling interval) of HMSFollower. This guarantees the update is polled by HMSFollower, so the test is not flaky. If you agree, I will resolve this issue. 

found another failure in a different class, but symptom looks the same

Error Message

Stacktrace

java.lang.AssertionError: Error at verifying Path action : /tmp/external/p1 ; expected:<WRITE_EXECUTE> but was:<null>
	at org.apache.sentry.tests.e2e.hdfs.TestHDFSIntegrationAdvanced.testAuthzObjOnPartitionMultipleTables(TestHDFSIntegrationAdvanced.java:597)

this failed test in build 2661 may be fixed by sentry-1757 "Avoid using local hive meta store using wrong configuration". Without this fix, local meta store may be used by HMSFollower in test, and cause test failure because update in real meta store is not fetched by HMSFollower.

In the console output in failed test, I can see  at HMSFollower is initialized at "2017-05-09 18:21:57,271", but hive meta store has not started at "2017-05-09 18:22:01,092" (the message after that is truncated).

I have reproduced the failure locally. from the log, I found "TestHDFSIntegrationAdvanced.testAuthzObjOnPartitionMultipleTables" fails from time to time. When I run the particular test, it always passes. When I run all test cases in TestHDFSIntegrationAdvanced, then testAuthzObjOnPartitionMultipleTables fails. I suspect it is because previous test clean up is not done before next test starts. So creating external table fails in the next test.

After adding delay in test clean up function TestHDFSIntegrationBase.cleanAfterTest(), the test succeeds.

In log, when such test failed, I can see the first time [Starting command: create external table tab1(a int) location '/tmp/external/p1'] succeeds, but the second time [Starting command: create external table tab1(a int) location '/tmp/external/p1'] fails due to [org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException Permission denied: user=hive, access=EXECUTE, inode="/tmp/external/p1":hdfs:hdfs:drwxrwx---]


sentry-1757 has fixed the issue by changing service orders in test, and make it the same as in production.
