The fails with:

{noformat}
../../src/tests/slave_recovery_tests.cpp:4797
Failed to wait 15secs for offers2
{noformat}

It is flaky because after partially accept the first offer, the scheduler will filter the agent for 5 seconds, and depending on the system load that may last more than 15 seconds:

I think we can either remove the expectation of the second offer (which I think is not essential to the test) or manually control the clock.

Full log attached.
