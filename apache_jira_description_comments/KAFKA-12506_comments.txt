cc [~wcarlson5] -- the first two items are probably a prerequisite for the test I described [here|https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10356#pullrequestreview-615974924], I'll try and remember to cross them off this list when we have something like that

[~ableegoldman], hi! I am new here and would like to contribute to Kafka starting with this issue ( as it seems interesting and is tagged as a newbie). Can I start working on it?

 

Thanks!

Go for it! Note that I moved the description to an umbrella ticket and converted this into a subtask under that ticket, check out [KAFKA-12521|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12521] for my proposal to improve these tests.

Also, I added you as a contributor so you self-assign tickets from now on

Hi [~ableegoldman], I have created a new [PR| https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10419] and waiting for your remarks.

 

Hi [~ableegoldman] , a test is failing due to wrong configurations and I was not able to pull up the file (as it is a local remote file on the server)

 The failure reason mentioned [here]([https://ci-builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Kafka%2Fkafka-pr/detail/PR-10432/7/pipeline/)] is as follows:
 
```
> Process 'Gradle Test Executor 55' finished with non-zero exit value 134  
[|https://ci-builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Kafka%2Fkafka-pr/detail/PR-10432/7/pipeline/#step-157-log-1556][2021-04-06T20:20:47.883Z] This problem might be caused by incorrect test process configuration. 
[|https://ci-builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Kafka%2Fkafka-pr/detail/PR-10432/7/pipeline/#step-157-log-1557][2021-04-06T20:20:47.883Z] Please refer to the test execution section in the User Manual at
```
 
I ran the exact Gradle commands mentioned in the Jenkins build as well as in the official home page documentation(readme of the main repo) multiple times before pushing the last commit. Can you help me debug here? Or any resourceful reading that you think I might have to go through? 
Thanks in advance!

Hey [~kebab-mai-haddi], if I understand correctly you are running `./gradlew streams:test` locally on your changes and it's passing, but the build is failing on the PR? If so it may be due to upstream changes, as Jenkins will always merge your branch with the latest trunk before running the unit tests on the PR. I recommend pulling or rebasing from trunk and re-running the tests.

Hey [~ableegoldman], actually I always rebase and run the complete tests. They pass and if they fail, I can see the reason but in here, it is hard to determine the failure as I wrote in my last comment - `This problem might be caused by incorrect test process configuration.`

 

It looks like the build might be broken with some unrelated tests that are just flaky. You can navigate to the tab that says "Tests" at the top on those links you provided and it will display a lit of the failed tests. eg https://ci-builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Kafka%2Fkafka-pr/detail/PR-10432/7/tests

You might not see those when running locally. Some tests are just flaky when run on Jenkins, like org.apache.kafka.streams.integration.KTableKTableForeignKeyInnerJoinMultiIntegrationTest. Others might not show up because you're only running Streams tests locally, and they're from another module, like kafka.server.RaftClusterTest

Don't worry about these flaky tests, especially if they're in core or connect, or anywhere outside of Streams since none of those have a dependency on Streams. If there are tests failing in Streams, but they're not a class or test you touched in the PR, then we need to use some judgement to figure out if it might be due to the changes or just flaky. We can always re-run the tests to try again.

Hi [~ableegoldman], upon running the command: `./gradlew streams:test`, I am getting a successful build:

```
