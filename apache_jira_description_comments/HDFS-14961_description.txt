HDFS-14130 made ZKFC aware of the Observer Namenode and hence allows ZKFC running along with the observer NOde.
The Observer namenode isn't suppose to be part of ZKFC election process.
But if the  Namenode was part of election, before turning into Observer by transitionToObserver Command. The ZKFC still sends instruction to the Namenode as a result of previous participation and sometimes tend to change the state of Observer to Standby.

This is also the reason for  failure in TestDFSZKFailoverController.

TestDFSZKFailoverController has been consistently failing with a time out waiting in testManualFailoverWithDFSHAAdmin(). In particular {{waitForHAState(1, HAServiceState.OBSERVER);}}.
