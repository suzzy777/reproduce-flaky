It seems locally and in Jenkins - the error message appears to have ordered the IPs in one order, now I ran it 100 times in Circle and it was always different order.

I made the test checking just that all the IPs we want appear in the exception and order won't matter.

PR lgtm but we still need a CI runs?

Well, I mentioned that it doesn't fail in Circle but I reproduce it locally so I was testing locally. I was thinking that probably we can skip the full for local run proof but considering you asked and our CI is funky, I pushed only the upgrade tests in Jenkins for 3.0, 4.0 and trunk as I am using the updated method also with the test for 3.0. Everything looks good to me:
[3.0|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest-upgrade/735/#showFailuresLink], [4.0|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest-upgrade/734/#showFailuresLink], [trunk|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest-upgrade/733/#showFailuresLink]

 

Side note: I don't see timeouts and these are rebased. 

Right. As the original link to the failure is on trunk and afaik CI is weird on 4.0 a CI link was worth it imo. Did you notice how the 4.0 here has 10 failures instead of 40-ish? There is sthg going on in 4.0... Anyway regarding this ticket +1. Thx for the work!
