Two unit tests can fail the same way:
{noformat}
--- FAIL: TestPlaceholderSmallerMulti (0.03s)
    partition_test.go:2645: assertion failed: error is not nil: timeout waiting for condition: the events should have been processed

--- FAIL: TestPlaceholderSmallerThanReal (0.01s)
    partition_test.go:2558: assertion failed: error is not nil: timeout waiting for condition: the event should have been processed{noformat}
 
In both cases, we have a very low timout value (10 msec), which can be a problem on slightly slower machines.
