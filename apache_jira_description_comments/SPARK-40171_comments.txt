What's common in these 3 tests and different from the rest:
 - They load a complete directory. *imagePath + "/cls=multichannel/"* is the intersection
 - They set the *dropInvalid* flag

Logs from failed run seem to have expired. Maybe these tests should be re-enabled, and once a failure is captured, logs should be attached to this ticket and tests should then be disabled.
