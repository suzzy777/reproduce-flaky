Removing the ability to request multiple containers would be an annoying regression for a large class of applications that merely want a non-locality-constrained bunch of processes on the cluster.  Have you considered allowing StoredContainerRequest to have multiple containers and including a decrementContainerRequest method?


IMO calling 
addContainerRequest(new ContainerRequest(5)) 
is only a little bit less work than calling
for(int i=0; i<5; ++i) {addContainerRequest(new ContainerRequest(1));}
Other than that there should be no change in any of those applications. They should continue to work as is after that.

Book-keeping for store containers is next to impossible when add(pri1, 5), add(pri1, 4) is called followed remove(pri1, 2). Internally, we dont know whether to remove from the first CR or the second. That makes getting getMatchingRequest API a non-starter. That is why getMatchingRequest is restricted for StoredContainerRequest. It makes the API confusing. Allowing users to get some CR and changing its container count outside of the AMRMClient will lead to other correctness issues. The API is messy the way it is right now. I had always wanted to do this but lost track of it because of TEZ stabilization work. Reviewing YARN-521 recently reminded of this when I noticed the duplication of stuff between CR and StoredCR and how its easy to miss them.

From what I see, the downside of this very minimal and upside is a much cleaner API. Hence I want to get this in before beta. I held back on it since YARN-521 was close and didnt want to cause unnecessary massive merge conflicts because of this simple refactor.

Attaching the refactoring patch. The code change in DistributedShell reflects the trivial changes needed for apps that would have used >1 container count in a single ContainerRequest.

The original test had a bug that got exposed by the changes I made. Fixed the test.

I've thought about this a little more and I'm no longer opposed to the change. I looked over the patch just have a few style nits: 

{code}
for(int i=0; i<numTotalContainers; ++i)
{code}
should be
{code}
for (int i = 0; i < numTotalContainers; ++i)
{code}

refs: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/CodeReviewChecklist and http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconventions-141388.html#475

In the following places, spacing should be preserved:
{code}
       addResourceRequest(req.getPriority(), rack, req.getCapability(),
-          req.getContainerCount(), req, true);
+            req, true);
{code}

{code}
       addResourceRequest(req.getPriority(), rack, req.getCapability(),
-          req.getContainerCount(), req, req.getRelaxLocality());
+            req, req.getRelaxLocality());
{code}

{code}

-    decResourceRequest(req.getPriority(), ResourceRequest.ANY, req.getCapability(),
-        req.getContainerCount(), req);
+    decResourceRequest(req.getPriority(), ResourceRequest.ANY, 
+                       req.getCapability(), req);
{code}

{code}
-    addResourceRequest(req.getPriority(), ResourceRequest.ANY, req.getCapability(),
-        req.getContainerCount(), req, req.getRelaxLocality());
+    addResourceRequest(req.getPriority(), ResourceRequest.ANY, 
+                    req.getCapability(), req, req.getRelaxLocality());
{code}

I was trying to speed up the test by reducing the sleep period and that made it flaky because the RM-NM heartbeat was still the large default value. Changed that value to be much smaller in the test and that should fix the flakiness.
Re-formatted that changed parts using Eclipse.
Hopefully this will be the last iteration :P
