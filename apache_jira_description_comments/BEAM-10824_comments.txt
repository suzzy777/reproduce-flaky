We originally used mmh3, but reverted to default hash function without realizing the consequences for distributed execution https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8799/.

AFAIK mmh dependency did not install cleanly on some Windows machines, we can see whether this is still the case now that we have precommit tests on Windows running on every PR.

We can also pick a different hash function that is deterministic. 

Hello! Due to a bug in our Jira configuration, this issue had status:Resolved but resolution:Unresolved.

I am bulk editing these issues to have resolution:Fixed

If a different resolution is appropriate, please change it. To do this, click the "Resolve" button (you can do this even for closed issues) and set the Resolution field to the right value.
