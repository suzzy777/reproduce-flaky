Docker image may have ENTRY_POINT predefined, but this is not supported in the current implementation.  It would be nice if we can detect existence of {{launch_command}} and base on this variable launch docker container in different ways:

h3. Launch command exists
{code}
docker run [image]:[version]
docker exec [container_id] [launch_command]
{code}

h3. Use ENTRY_POINT
{code}
docker run [image]:[version]
{code}
