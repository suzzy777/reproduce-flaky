This kind of failure usually indicates a GC problem in the member that was kicked out.

Artifacts for this run are no longer available.  Stdout for the test shows that these tests were run prior to GemFireDataCommandsDUnitTest:

* GetCommandOnRegionWithCacheLoaderDuringCacheMissDUnitTest
* DeployCommandsDUnitTest
* CreateAlterDestroyRegionCommandsDUnitTest
* SharedConfigurationCommandsDUnitTest
* MiscellaneousCommandsExportLogsPart2DUnitTest
* ShowMetricsDUnitTest
* QueueCommandsDUnitTest
* IndexCommandsDUnitTest
* DiskStoreCommandsDUnitTest
* MiscellaneousCommandsExportLogsPart3DUnitTest
* ListAndDescribeRegionDUnitTest
* ListIndexCommandDUnitTest
* ShowDeadlockDUnitTest
* ConfigCommandsDUnitTest

Some of these (such as ShowDeadlockDUnitTest) create asynchronous invocations that they do not ensure are shut down at the end of the test.  This may have lead to the ForcedDisconnectionException being logged.


flaky environment or flaky previously run tests - we need artifacts to determine which test caused this.
