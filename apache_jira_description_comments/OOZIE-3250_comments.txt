Failing tests are unrelated. [~misha@cloudera.com] [~gezapeti] can you please review?

Thank you for making this change, [~andras.piros]!

I was on the verge of approving it when I realized that attempting to intern arrays in the same way as non-array objects may not work as expected. That's because the equals() method in arrays compares two arrays with a simple '==', rather than by contents. So you have to use some more code to achieve what you want. See the test below that I wrote, it's self-explanatory enough.
{code:java}
import com.google.common.collect.Interner;
import com.google.common.collect.Interners;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Test;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class TestByteArrayInterning {

  private static final Interner<byte[]> BYTE_ARRAY_INTERNER = Interners.newWeakInterner();

  private static final Interner<ByteArrayWrapper> BYTE_ARWR_INTERNER = Interners.newWeakInterner();

  @Test
  public void testByteArrayInterning() {
    int nArrs = 1000;
    int nEls = 100;
    byte[][] sameContentArrs = new byte[nArrs][];
    for (int i = 0; i < nArrs; i++) {
      byte[] b = new byte[nEls];
      sameContentArrs[i] = b;
      for (int j = 0; j < nEls; j++) b[j] = (byte) j;
    }

    byte[][] internedArrs = new byte[nArrs][];
    for (int i = 0; i < nArrs; i++) {
      internedArrs[i] = BYTE_ARRAY_INTERNER.intern(sameContentArrs[i]);
    }

    // Trying to intern byte[] arrays directly doesn't work, because in the implemenation
    // of arrays the equals() method is the same as '=='. It doesn't compare arrays' _contents_
    for (int i = 1; i < nArrs; i++) {
      Assert.assertFalse(internedArrs[i-1] == internedArrs[i]);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < nArrs; i++) {
      internedArrs[i] = BYTE_ARWR_INTERNER.intern(new ByteArrayWrapper(sameContentArrs[i])).bytes;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i < nArrs; i++) {
      Assert.assertTrue(internedArrs[i-1] == internedArrs[i]);
    }
  }

  /**
   * A wrapper class, whose only purpose is to effectively override the wrapped
   * array's equals() method, so that we compare the contents of two arrays.
   * The default implementation of equals() in an array performs just an identity
   * check.
   *
   * If arrays are big and/or CPU performance of this code is critical, one may
   * consider caching the hashcode of the wrapped array after hashCode() is called
   * for the first time.
   */
  private static class ByteArrayWrapper {
    private final byte[] bytes;

    ByteArrayWrapper(byte[] bytes) {
      this.bytes = bytes;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
      return Arrays.hashCode(bytes);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
      if (!(other instanceof ByteArrayWrapper)) return false;
      return Arrays.equals(bytes, ((ByteArrayWrapper) other).bytes);
    }
  }
}{code}

Thanks [~misha@cloudera.com] for your insights!

Please find attached the new patch, addressing this {{equals()}} / {{==}} issue w/ {{byte[]}} instances. In this implementation I used {{java.nio.ByteBuffer}}.

Thanks for the improvement [~andras.piros]!

Shouldn't we use == in the test instead of    Arrays.equals ? This test passes even if I remove internalization from the code.

Any ideas on the performance impact of reading through all the byte arrays? I don't imagine it's huge as we'll usually parse there arrays as Strings later. Would it make sense to keep only one copy of the data in StringBlob and BinaryBlob? E.g. when the getString is called in StringBlob, the byte array could be nulled out as it can be recalculated if needed from the String value. This would again be some calculation overhead added to gain some space in memory. I'm not sure it's worth it but it might worth a try.

Also, are we 100% sure that the contents of the arrays are not changing? I haven't checked all the places in all the Beans but it looks like we're in the safe zone here.

I agree with [~gezapeti] wrt. the needed changes to the test. Arrays.equals() compares the _contents_ of two arrays, i.e. we can have ar1 != ar2, but Arrays.equals(ar1, ar2). So it's exactly opposite of what we need in this test, because we really want to achieve ar1 == ar2 after internalization of ar1 and ar2. So please replace Arrays.equals() with '==' and maybe furthermore add a similar check, but with !=, for arrays before internalization, same as done in my original example. This will hopefully remove some confusion for the future maintainers of this code.

 

[~gezapeti] using now {{==}} instead of {{Arrays.equals()}} to show that all interned {{byte[]}} instances are the same. Also introduced another test case to show that interning a huge {{byte[]}} many times doesn't increase heap in any significant way, and is fast (1000 x 1MB in 1.5 seconds on my machine). So I don't think we have a performance problem here. I'm also sure the contents of the interned {{byte[]}} instances aren't changing without modifying the underlying arrays. I'm planning another round of Oozie heap analysis with multiple running coordinators before and after the fix.

[~misha@cloudera.com] added a similar check before to show that copied {{byte[]}} point to another instances, for better maintainability.

Thanks for the fixes [~andras.piros]! 
I get itchy when I look at  testInterningSameByteArrayManyTimesDoesNotIncreaseHeap(). It feels like this will be the next flaky test we're chasing. I don't think it's worth keeping. I still have a dream when we're capable of running tests in parallel and this test is probably one working against that. Please remove it.

If weakIntern() works as I think it does it may get slow after it have internalized a lot of arrays. Can you do a measurement of 10k byte[]s of random lengths but the same content (as an easily coded worst-case-like scenario)? I don't think it will count but still, things will get slower if the number of internalized arrays is big.

[~gezapeti] removed {{TestByteUtils#testInterningSameByteArrayManyTimesDoesNotIncreaseHeap()}} and introduced {{TestByteUtils#testInterningRandomByteArrays()}} that does 10k * 10k random {{byte[]}} allocation and interning. Allocation alone takes around 7.8 seconds on my box, allocation plus interning takes around 8.0 seconds - interning doesn't seem to take too many resources both in terms of CPU and memory.

The last patch looks good to me. Thank you for your efforts, [~andras.piros]

It's great that you tested performance of this stuff. I realize that the performance measurement code is fragile so it doesn't make sense to keep it as a test that gets re-run regularly. But I think it would make sense to at least mention your performance numbers in the javadoc of the ByteArrayUtils class, so that in the future people don't have doubts about it.

Thanks for the reviews [~gezapeti] [~misha@cloudera.com]! Renamed to {{ByteArrayUtils}}, and extended Javadoc by mentioning the performance numbers from patch 004.

+1 (pending Jenkins on patch-6). The latest jhenkins run I could find is for patch-5.

edit: oh, it's started then
