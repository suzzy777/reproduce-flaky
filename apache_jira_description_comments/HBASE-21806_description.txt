In large heterogeneous clusters sometimes a slow datanode can cause WAL syncs to be very slow. In this case, before the bad datanode recovers, or is discovered and repaired, it would be helpful to roll WAL on a very slow sync to get a new pipeline.
Otherwise the slow WAL will impact write latency for a long time (slow writes result in less writes result in the WAL not being rolled for longer)
