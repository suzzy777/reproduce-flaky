GEODE-1011: Rearranged the order of creating test elements

	* Caches are created first, followed by region and sender/receiver
	* Removed the pauses, as they are not necessary. Awaitility handles the waiting
	* Issue assumed to be resolved after WAN refactoring
	* Flaky tag removed


Precheckin with no failures.
Issue assumed to be not flaky until it fails again.
