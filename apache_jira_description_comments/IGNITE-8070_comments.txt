[~ptupitsyn] Could you please review my PR.

TC run seems OK to me, 2 tests in .NET suite have failed, one is flaky, second has failed by accident. I rerun it locally many times in my branch and always it finishes ok.

[~ivandasch] please see my comments in Upsource.

[~ptupitsyn] thank you for your review.Â 

The most of your remarks are clear for me, but I have one question about one thing. Currently I don't know

the best variant for this. Could you please add your opinion in upsource review?

[~ptupitsyn] I suppose I've corrected all issues.Could you please review again? TC build is attached.

[~ivandasch] looks good to me, merged to master: {{0bb56a64e338d676e3182244e17f9e79a318f808}}
