I introduced this dunit test for GEODE-4942, while GEODE-4942 is for parallel gateway sender, the test is for serial gateway sender. And I did reproduce the issue: event is dropped at primary sender (because it's not running yet), but event has been put into unprocessedEventsMap at secondary sender's queue and will stay there forever.
