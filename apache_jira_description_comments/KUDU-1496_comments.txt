Attaching log file with output

Saw essentially the same issue in the flume java test -- seems like the minicluster just didn't wait long enough for the master to start, and then the client got Connection Refused and bailed.

This change removed the return of the request's deferred, and now always sends a fromError(): https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/3295/5/java/kudu-client/src/main/java/org/kududb/client/AsyncKuduClient.java

This is wrong because for NoLeaderMasterFoundException we consider it a retryable exception and it shouldn't go back to the client (while also retrying).

Yes, it should not be remove, still didn't know what I was thinking when deleting that.



Fixed in bb16e36af6d792f84df1932c18fc3a3855917a88.
