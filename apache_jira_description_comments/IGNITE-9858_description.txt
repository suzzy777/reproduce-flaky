SystemCacheNotConfiguredTest hangs sometimes on TeamCity (timeout).

Example of such failures on master branch: [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&buildTypeId=&tab=testDetails&testNameId=-2762467041583095183&order=TEST_STATUS_DESC&itemsCount=50&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=%3Cdefault%3E]

When we using ip finder in shared mode each node should register self address (except clients, obviously).
Check that the node is a client uses installed (via DI @IgniteInstanceResource) Ignite instance (see {{TcpDiscoveryIpFinderAdapter#initializeLocalAddresses}}).
So when client and server starts simultaneously, the following scenario is possible - Ignite server injected at first, then the Ignite client injected when the SPI is initialized ({{spiStart}}) both nodes assume that the local node is a client and don't register local address.
