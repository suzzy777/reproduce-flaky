I found that the failed UT are timed out waiting for grant global finished. Maybe too many tables are created in this test.

Thank you for taking a look [~meiyi]. Yesterday I changed this test so that each method makes tables named for the method rather than sharing table name. Deleting the table at end of test is going to make it work harder -- especially as lots of methods. It may make things worse but lets try it. Pushed on branch-2.3+.  Thanks.
