We found that [test_alter_table_recover()|https://github.com/apache/impala/blame/master/tests/metadata/test_ddl.py#L1026] could finish the execution within 10 seconds with JDK 17 when enable_async_ddl_execution is False and thus the check in the [else branch|https://github.com/apache/impala/blame/master/tests/metadata/test_ddl.py#L1079C12-L1079C12] could fail. Don't know it has something to do with JDK but maybe we could reduce the expected execution time a little bit to make the test less flaky.
{code}
      # In sync mode:
      #  The entire DDL is processed in the exec step with delay. exec_time should be
      #  more than 10 seconds.
      #
      # In async mode:
      #  The compilation of DDL is processed in the exec step without delay. And the
      #  processing of the DDL plan is in wait step with delay. The wait time should
      #  definitely take more time than 10 seconds.
      if enable_async_ddl:
        assert(wait_time >= 10)
      else:
        assert(exec_time >= 10)
