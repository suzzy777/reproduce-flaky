Approval waiting on https://lists.apache.org/thread/mzj3dq8b7mzf60k6mkby88b9n9ywmsgw

For (1), (2) and (2a):
 - trunk: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...michaelsembwever:cassandra:mck/18705/trunk
 - cassandra-5.0: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...michaelsembwever:cassandra:mck/18705/5.0

CI
- trunk: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/michaelsembwever/cassandra?branch=mck%2F18705%2Ftrunk
- 5.0: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/michaelsembwever/cassandra?branch=mck%2F18705%2F5.0

I think we also need 6) for CI to pass dtests on trunk.

cassandra-dtest patch: [https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/compare/trunk...thelastpickle:cassandra-dtest:mck/18705]

-still a few failures here in trunk, working on them…-

all failures also exist in trunk, or are known flakies.

[~brandon.williams], can you review the 5.0, trunk, dtest patches please.

(7) is already being tackled by CASSANDRA-18738

bq. can you review the 5.0, trunk, dtest patches please.

Those look good, +1.

bq. all failures also exist in trunk, or are known flakies.

I'm not certain that's true for the upgrade failures aside from test_negative_timestamp?

(3) is done.

Good catch [~brandon.williams] – there's a number of {{upgrade_tests.upgrade_through_versions_test.TestUpgrade_indev_5_0_x_To_indev_trunk}} failures against both the 5.0 and trunk patches. Will investigate…

bq. {{upgrade_tests.upgrade_through_versions_test.TestUpgrade_indev_5_0_x_To_indev_trunk}} failures 

New clusters starting on 5.0+ needed {{'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions': 'false'}} in their config.

Fixed here: https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/compare/trunk...thelastpickle:cassandra-dtest:mck/18705#diff-07398747ddef781d28fb5698a943dc5f8bb2b1b4136a99a980a4f83fdaf533cfR383-R385 

Same CI links above updated with new runs with this fixed.
Specifically
 - 5.0 https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/michaelsembwever/cassandra/228/workflows/9a5714b5-e60c-4743-b122-ee4b3c39061d/jobs/17563/tests
 - trunk https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/michaelsembwever/cassandra/227/workflows/39893ff4-9dee-4252-a36c-7cc34e530db2/jobs/17541/tests

That^ is ready for committing. Just awaiting final review [~brandon.williams].

Next steps for (5), (6) and (9)

 - https://github.com/apache/cassandra-website/compare/trunk...thelastpickle:cassandra-website:mck/18705

+1 on those.

Docker image needs more fixing: https://github.com/apache/cassandra-builds/compare/trunk...thelastpickle:cassandra-builds:mck/18705-docker

Merged and images pushed to dockerhub.
