It is quite clear from the fix of FLINK-3679 that in reality, users might encounter corrupted messages from Kafka / Kinesis / generally external sources when deserializing them.

The consumers should support simply skipping those messages, by letting the deserialization schema return {{null}}, and checking {{null}} values within the consumer.

This has been done for the Kafka consumer already. This ticket tracks the improvement for the Kinesis consumer.
