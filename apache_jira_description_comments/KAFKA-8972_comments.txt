[~bchen225242] I've also seen this fail with a different but related error, a RocksDbException. Do you think we should track this all under one ticket for the test_broker_type_bounce failures, or have a separate ticket for each kind of failure we see? It's difficult to tell if/how exactly the two are related, but I suspect they are since they both have to do with incorrectly opening/closing a store

A status update: [~ableegoldman] found the last bug which lies in the `assignedTasks` as we hit task migrated exception. The root cause is that simply calling `closeZombieTask` does not clear the task state such as in changelog reader, which will make it attempt to reopen a state store that's already open in the next generation. Next Sophie will convert this small [patch|[https://github.com/abbccdda/kafka/pull/1/files]] into a standard PR, and fix the problem.

ableegoldman commented on pull request #7608: KAFKA-8972 (2.4 blocker): clear all state for zombie task on commit failed
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7608
 
 
   Third bugfix for the failing broker bounce system test with cooperative rebalancing:
   
   **tl;dr** We need to remove everything associated with a task when it is closed, but in some cases (eg AssignedTasks#commit`) on a `TaskMigratedException` we would close it as a zombie and then (only) remove the taskId from the `running` map. This left  its partitions, restorers, state stores, etc around and in an undefined state, causing exceptions when closing and/or opening the stores again.
   
   **Longer explanation:**
   In AssignedTasks (the abstract class from which the standby and active task variations extend) a commit failure (even due to broker down/unavailable) is treated as a TaskMigratedException after which the failed task is closed as a zombie and removed from running -- the remaining tasks (ie those still in running are then also closed as zombies in the subsequent onPartitionsLost
   
   However we do not remove the closed task from runningByPartition nor do we remove the corresponding changelogs, if restoring, from the StoreChangelogReader since that applies only to active tasks, and AssignedTasks is generic/abstract. The changelog reader then retains a mapping from the closed task's changelog partition to its CompositeRestoreListener (and does not replace this when the new one comes along after the rebalance). The restore listener has a reference to a specific RocksDBStore instance, one which was closed when the task was closed as a zombie, so it accidentally tries to restore to the "old" RocksDBStore instance rather than the new one that was just opened.
   
   Although technically this bug existed before KIP-429, it was only uncovered now that we remove tasks and clear their state/partitions/etc one at a time. We don't technically need to cherrypick the fix back earlier as before we just blindly clear all data structures entirely during an eager rebalance.

Nice work guys!

   This is a typo bug which is due to calling a wrong map.

ableegoldman commented on pull request #7620: KAFKA-8972 (2.4 blocker): TaskManager state should always be updated after rebalance
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7620
 
 
   Currently when we identify version probing we return early from `onAssignment` and never get to updating state with the rebalance results.
   
   ...More details to be filled in, pending verification of test results
   
   Should be cherry-picked to 2.4
