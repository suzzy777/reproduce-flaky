Looks like the filter only processed ~95% of the rows read. I confess it's not clear why - the filter showed up after ~400ms in the scan nodes. Best guess is a race where the initial scan ranges got issued before the filter arrived for some reason. Let's keep an eye on it, but I don't think this is a critical bug if all the other runtime filter tests continue to pass.

This Jira is old, has little information, and there have been several recent JIRAs filed for similar flakiness in this test, so there's not really any value to keeping this around.
