It seems like we only ever have 1 socket which is hanging out in {{CLOSE_WAIT}}, so it may still be a timing issue.

I'll look into the test failure, but we should keep this test out until we can either make it stable or replace it with something else (see also CASSANDRA-10879).

We've got some new machinery that'll make it easier to filter out known failures. I'm documenting that as we speak. I'm ok with keeping this flaky test around now that that's in place.

I have a new [dtest branch|https://github.com/carlyeks/cassandra-dtest/tree/10863] which switched from using {{lsof}} to the jmx {{connectedThriftClients}}, which was also non-0 in the original ticket (CASSANDRA-6546).

A [3.0 branch|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/carlyeks/job/carlyeks-ticket-10863-3.0-dtest/lastSuccessfulBuild/testReport/thrift_hsha_test/ThriftHSHATest/test_closing_connections/history/] on cassci looks OK.

I've run this a couple more times and it doesn't look like it is failing. I've opened a dtest PR.

Committed fix to dtest as [{{40b03e6}}|https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/commit/40b03e6f9a488a19c5580be97278b8b502448cc2].
