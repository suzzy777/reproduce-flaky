Yesterday we started defaulting the precommit parameter for the flaky test list to point to the job on builds.a.o. Looks like the personality is ignoring it.

example build that's marked to keep:

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/7646/

(search for 'Running unit tests' to skip to the right part of the console')

should add some more debug output in there too.
