Provide a read-only mode for a table. Writes to the table in read-only mode will be rejected, but read-only mode is different from disable in that:
1. it doesn't offline the regions of the table(hence much more lightweight than disable)
2. it can serve read requests

Also support a cluster level read only state, a shortcut for setting all tables served by the cluster into read only mode, with a similar shortcut for resuming normal operations.

Client write requests to the table(s) set in read only mode should be rejected. 

We need an exception for HBCK. When operating in read only mode all writes made by HBCK should be allowed as an exception.
