    Selenium 3.x requires JDK8, guava-23, google.gson-2.8.2, which was conflicting with existing zeppelin-server package, hence have moved if to selenium testing to a new package called "zeppelin-integration".
    Also in the Travis matrix have change dist to trusty (which might be required for ZEPPELIN-3118) and set JDK as oraclejdk8.

    I agree with moving integration tests to new module. I have a question. AFAIK, modern web browsers already had web driver for selenium tests. Can you tell me why you add gecko driver and Firefox 31? You can upgrade the version of browsers up-to-date. How do you think of it?

    I had to use gecko because "Firefox is only fully supported at version 47.0.1 or earlier. Support
      for later versions of firefox is provided by geckodriver" 
    Ref: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/CHANGELOG
    
    Yes, I plan to upgrade version of Firefox as well, I was just waiting for CI to pass as it used to pass on dist=precise (which uses FireFox 31)

    Tried FireFox-56, it works, is failing with some of the flaky tests (https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/326228047/log.txt, https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/326219155/log.txt)
    
    Along with that build (https://travis-ci.org/prabhjyotsingh/zeppelin/builds/3262280430) is also failing for profile 6-10 with:
    ```
      ZeppelinSparkClusterTest.sparkRTest:208 expected:<FINISHED> but was:<ERROR>
    ```
    which is not related to this.

    Travis job (https://travis-ci.org/prabhjyotsingh/zeppelin/jobs/326663402) for selenium passed, it fails for 608.[6-10] which is not related to this.
    
    Will add support for newer Firefox versions and fix flaky test failures in a different PR.
