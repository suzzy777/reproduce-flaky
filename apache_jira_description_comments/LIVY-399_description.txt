Currently because we lack pyspark and sparkr dependencies in our environment, so we neglect the pyspark and sparkr integration test, also the UT for PySpark and SparkR doesn't involve Spark things, only test the plain python and R REPL, so we should figure out a way to support real test for PySpark and SparkR interpreters.
