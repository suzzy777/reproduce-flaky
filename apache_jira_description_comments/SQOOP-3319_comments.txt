SQOOP-3319: Extract code using Kite into separate classes

(Szabolcs Vasas via Boglarka Egyed)


The [unit test job|https://builds.apache.org/job/Sqoop-hadoop200/] had failing tests:
 * TestAccumuloImport - somewhat flaky, became green on re-execution
 * TestLargeObjectLoader - seems to be failing due to a current Apache Infrastructure slowness issue (time out), it passes on Mac and Linux OS too

These are unrelated to this specific change.

Thanks [~vasas] for this patch, please close the related Review Request to..

I have opened INFRA-16597 as the issue seems to persist with TestLargeObjectLoader.

Latest run was SUCCESSFUL, infra problem seems to be resolved.

Linking SQOOP-3331 as it fixes an issue introduced by this JIRA.
