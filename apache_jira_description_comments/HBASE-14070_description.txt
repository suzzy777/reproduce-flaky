HBase and Phoenix uses systems physical clock (PT) to give timestamps to events (read and writes). This works mostly when the system clock is strictly monotonically increasing and there is no cross-dependency between servers clocks. However we know that leap seconds, general clock skew and clock drift are in fact real. 

This jira proposes using Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC) as an implementation of hybrid physical clock + a logical clock. HLC is best of both worlds where it keeps causality relationship similar to logical clocks, but still is compatible with NTP based physical system clock. HLC can be represented in 64bits.
