The documentation: [https://oozie.apache.org/docs/5.0.0/WebServicesAPI.html#Purge_Command]

states that the purge REST endpoint is a GET one but it is a PUT endpoint. This should be fixed. In [https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/docs/src/site/markdown/WebServicesAPI.md] it should say "PUT" instead of "GET".
