https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-8876 fixed the flakiness in *testInstallIncrementalSnapshotWithFailure* by commenting out the part that checks the metrics. 

By uncommenting this part, the test has a 5% chance of failure. The metrics depend on picking up that
 * there is a corruption on the candidate dir
 * Ratis returns a result of SNAPSHOT_UNAVAILABLE
 * Candidate dir is getting cleaned up
 * The follower is forced to take another full snapshot

During the failed runs, the corruption isn't picked up and the Ratis InstallSnapshotResult is SUCCESS. Therefore, the snapshot installation isn't repeated.
