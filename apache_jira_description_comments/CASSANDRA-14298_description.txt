It appears that cqlsh-tests on builds.apache.org on all branches stopped working since we removed nosetests from the system environment. See e.g. [here|https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Cassandra/job/Cassandra-trunk-cqlsh-tests/458/cython=no,jdk=JDK%201.8%20(latest),label=cassandra/console]. Looks like we either have to make nosetests available again or migrate to pytest as we did with dtests. Giving pytest a quick try resulted in many errors locally, but I haven't inspected them in detail yet.
