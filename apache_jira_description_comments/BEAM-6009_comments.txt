Should this be re-opened since even in batch mode nearly all Jenkins runs fail?

I'd keep this closed because this issue just tracks splitting PVR into a dedicated batch and streaming test run. There is BEAM-6326 for the streaming side which needs to be fixed. Similarly, we could create an issue for batch related problems.
