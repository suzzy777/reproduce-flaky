Solr's BackupRepository interface provides an abstraction around the physical location/format that backups are stored in.  This allows plugin writers to create "repositories" for a variety of storage mediums.  It'd be nice if Solr offered more mediums out of the box though, such as some of the "blobstore" offerings provided by various cloud providers.

This ticket proposes that a "BackupRepository" implementation for Google's popular 'Cloud Storage' blobstore, so that Solr users can use it for backups without needing to write their own code.

Google offers a GCS Java client with acceptable licensing, and the integration code is relatively simple.  The biggest challenge in supporting this will likely be procedural - integration testing requires GCS access and GCS access costs money.  We can check with INFRA to see if there is any way to get cloud credits for an integration test to run in nightly Jenkins runs on the ASF Jenkins server.  Alternatively we can try to stub out the blobstore in some reliable way.
