In method org.apache.ignite.internal.util.IgniteUtils#workDirectory

Ignite determine Work dir to be set, same value may be used in case persistence Store Folder is not set and IGNITE_HOME is not specified.

In case work dir is not specified, temp directory is used for Ignite Work. But for persistence enabled case this means user DB goes to temp folder and may be removed later.

User may be confused by this behaviour. See:
