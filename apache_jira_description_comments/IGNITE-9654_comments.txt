    Fix test.

----


I have fixed the main problem in the test that appeared after merge IGNITE-8158.

The reason was in the grid restart future that interrupted by timeout. _awaitTopologyChange()_ invocation in the method _GridAbstractTest#stopGrid_ throws _InterruptedException_ and setting _stopGridErr_ flag. It throws _RuntimeException("Not all Ignite instances has been stopped")_ on tear down.

But the test is still flaky(low probability). The reason is described in IGNITE-7766 and still unsolved. I have added an error message in the test method for clarity. [TC mass runs tests|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Queries1&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F4797%2Fhead&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv].

Thanks, [~NSAmelchev], merged to master and ignite-2.7.
