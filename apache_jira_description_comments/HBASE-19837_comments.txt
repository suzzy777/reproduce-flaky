Pushed debug to master and branch-2 so can see how the two views differ on failure. Changes the row names so they are readable.

ClusterStatus is missing Regions that have been assigned to the server and that show as being on the server in earlier logs. Perhaps the ClusterStatus is stale but that don't seem right either given how the assign happened a good while earlier.

Pushed a dumb wait. See if the problem is stale clusterstatus. If not, then there is a translation problem – a real issue. ClusterStatus is dropping detail.

 

[~uagashe] FYI

 

+1, lgtm

Dumb wait seems to have removed this test from the flakies list which would seem to say that we need to wait on new cluster status update before we do our counters check. Let me do a better job with the patch than shove in a 10 second stall.

Pushed an addendum, see attached 0001-HBASE-19837-Flakey-TestRegionLoad-ADDENDUM-Report-mo.patch, that still 'waits' but it also makes the reporting interval 500ms instead of default 3000ms. At worse should wait 1000s. If this don't fix it, need to refactor test. Added some debug to TestMetaShutdown too.... 

Resolving. Will open new issue if still flakey to refactor the test.
