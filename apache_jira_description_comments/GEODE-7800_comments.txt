GEODE-7800: Add Redis PSUBSCRIBE and PUNSUBSCRIBE commands (#4705)

* GEODE-7800: Add Redis PSUBSCRIBE and PUNSUBSCRIBE commands

Similar to `SUBSCRIBE` and `UNSUBSCRIBE`, `PSUBSCRIBE` allows a client
to subscribe to a pattern. For example: `PSUBSCRIBE sal*s`

The subscription pattern is in the form of a glob supporting `*`, `?`
and ranges. https://redis.io/commands/psubscribe

Pattern subscriptions must be unsubscribed verbatim. i.e., the above
subscription would not be unsubscribed using the pattern `s*`, but must
be unsubscribed using the complete subscribed pattern, namely `sal*s`.

When clients subscribe to overlapping patterns (or channels) they will
receive a message for every matched subscription. Matches for a single
client are not conflated.

* Fixes flaky test

* Adds license to PublishResult

* Clean code using spA and make test reliable

stop propagating exceptions that get thrown when disconnecting Jedis

* Cleans up subscribers and publishers after each test or after the whole class as needed
