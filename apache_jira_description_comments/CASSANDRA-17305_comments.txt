I would say we check whether this one fails often and either take care to raise the timing or whatever is needed or if it happens extremely rare we can mark as not a blocker but just 4.x

I couldn't reproduce it - [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1683/workflows/52efff0a-60d1-43ac-8898-b0c1dd6cf70b/jobs/11800/steps]

 

Also, stable in Butler since we fixed our infra issues so I am closing the ticket for now. The test just timeout a few times when we had issues with the infra it seems. We will monitor and reopen in case something changes for different reasons.
