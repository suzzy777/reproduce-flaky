While debugging an issue I noticed that during EXPLAIN the following methods throw a NullPointerException:
 VectorColumnOutputMapping#finalize
 AbstractOperatorDesc#getUserLevelStatistics
 AbstractOperatorDesc#getColumnExprMapForExplain

The exceptions do end up getting caught but we should add null checks and gracefully to be less wasteful and to aid future debugging.
