Repair tests come up in test failure reports every now and then. I have tried to repro the [latest|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/241/testReport/junit/dtest-novnode.repair_tests.repair_test/TestRepair/test_simple_sequential_repair/] locally 100 times with no luck.
_dtest-novnode.repair_tests.repair_test/TestRepair/test_simple_sequential_repair_

Still from experience from fixing other flaky tests I have some intuition where the problems may lie. The proposed fix should add no harm if merged. We can reopen the ticket if repair tests keep failing.
