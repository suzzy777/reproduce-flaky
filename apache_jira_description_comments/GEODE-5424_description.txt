Lets change all use of Awaitility in geode to use a standard timeout of 5 minutes. 

We could do this by introducing a new static factory that wraps Awaitility.await(), eg GeodeAwaitility.await() that sets the timeout to be 5 minutes, and bulk change all of our use of Awaitility to GeodeAwaitility.

While we're at it, we might also want to change the default poll delay and poll interval to something smaller if that will speed up our tests.
