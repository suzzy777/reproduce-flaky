I did not manage to reproduce it:

Here are some repeated runs:

The runs have reproduced the failure in 4.1, 5.0 and trunk. I haven't tried older branches. So it seems it wasn't introduced in 5.0. 

Flakiness seems well below 1%.

Note that the test class was renamed in 5.0 by CASSANDRA-17056/CEP-17 from {{org.apache.cassandra.db.VerifyTest}} to {{org.apache.cassandra.io.sstable.VerifyTest}}.

Good catch, then shall we mark the ticket with 5.0.x, not a beta/rc blocker as it is not a regression?

Agree, it's not a 5.0 regression.
