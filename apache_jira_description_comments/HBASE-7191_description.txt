One of our clients run into a problem, in which they have the hbase.root.dir, and cluster data, but their hbase.id and hbase.version files are corrupted. HMaster creates those on start, but not if there is already existing data.

We can add smt like --fixIdFile, and ability for HBCK to do some offline repairs for the version file.
