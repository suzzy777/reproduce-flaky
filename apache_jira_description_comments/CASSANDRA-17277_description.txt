{quote}ci-cassandra run bot updating ticket in JIRA w/state of test run for the SHA (JIRA Pending; to be linked)
{quote}
We already run CI for every commit (see [example|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/]). The goal is to have automation that'll tie the results of a commit to the original JIRA ticket and update it automatically w/a comment indicating:
 * The results of the CI run (duration, pass, fail, # failures)
 * Any potential regressions in CI from the merge w/links to job history ([example|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/912/testReport/junit/dtest.cqlsh_tests.test_cqlsh_copy/TestCqlshCopy/test_bulk_round_trip_with_timeouts/history/])

From a workflow perspective we want to optimize for having as minimal friction as possible to see the impact of one's commit on ci-cassandra and rapidly verify if their change appears to have destabilized any tests on that infrastructure.
