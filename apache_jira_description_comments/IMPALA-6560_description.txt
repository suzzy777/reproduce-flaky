We don't have a good regression test for IMPALA-2376. With IMPALA-4835 and other changes it's increasingly difficult to get the query to OOM at the intended place. We probably need to construct some special test data with a very large nested collection to trigger this bug.

This is based on the TODO:

---- QUERY
# IMPALA-2376
# Set memory limit low enough to get the below query to consistently fail.
# TODO: change query and/or table so we can consistently check for the following error:
# Failed to allocate buffer for collection '...'.
set mem_limit=4m;
select max(cnt) from customer c,
(select count(l_returnflag) cnt from c.c_orders.o_lineitems) v;
