We are currently reading all checkpoint markers and related information from the WAL archive at startup as part of an improvement made at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-13052.

It can lead to a long start-up process because of slow disks.

We should save the necessary partition information to disk, which we can use for retrospective rebalancing, instead of reading all the checkpoint information from the WAL archive.
