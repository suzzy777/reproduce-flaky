All test job runs: [https://github.com/HD372000/ozone/actions/workflows/test-flaky.yml] 
I have executed the tests on current master branch.

There are total 7 tests in *TestContainerStateManagerIntegration* including *testGetMatchingContainerMultipleThreads* all are getting passed. This issue can't be reproduced after repeated execution for a few times in CI.

Thanks [~himanshi.darvekar] for checking.  Since {{TestContainerStateManagerIntegration}} passed 350 times, I think we can remove the {{Flaky}} annotation.

Removed the flaky annotation from TestContainerStateManagerIntegration.
