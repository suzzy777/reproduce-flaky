This test is rather flaky, cf. KAFKA-7965. It might be best to merge both tickets?

Can we close this as a duplicate?

The other ticket is resolved, but I just saw another failure for this test: [https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk11-scala2.13/7034/testReport/junit/kafka.api/ConsumerBounceTest/testRollingBrokerRestartsWithSmallerMaxGroupSizeConfigDisruptsBigGroup/]

Thanks for reporting [~mjsax]. I just checked the logs and there is nothing to diagnose the issue in there. It seems that the test ran slower than usual though. It may indicate an overloaded Jenkins worker. I will keep an eye on it.

This test failed for me with:
{code:java}
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: The remaining consumers in the group could not fetch the expected records
	at org.scalatest.Assertions.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:530)

[~dajac] Could I take over this issue? I have encountered this flaky many times recently.

[~chia7712] I will take a look at this. I wonder why this has come back more frequently now...

[~dajac] Thank you so much :)

flaky again :(

It seems that we haven't seen this one for a while now. I will close it. Please, re-open if necessary.
