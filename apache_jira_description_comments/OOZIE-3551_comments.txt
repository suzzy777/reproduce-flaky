Thanks for reporting this!
We have a bunch of these already set in [SparkArgsExtractor|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/sharelib/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/SparkArgsExtractor.java#L58-L63]
They were added incrementally as Spark changed. The last iteration of this was in OOZIE-3036. 

We currently have support for [HCatCredentials|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/HCatCredentials.java] to talk to the metastore and [Hive2Credentials|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/Hive2Credentials.java] for HS2.
Do we need to add support for more kinds delegation tokens for Hive now? 


Hi [~gezapeti],
When this issue was found, we only identified these two confs which were missing.
I've just uploaded a patch covering these two, with unit test modifications.
Manual tests confirmed that these work, but it would be nice if you could check it out.
Thank you, Liz

I don't like the fact that we have to add these one-by-one, but I can't see a way to tell Spark to disable all credentials at once without disabling security.

Thanks for the contribution [~z17]!
