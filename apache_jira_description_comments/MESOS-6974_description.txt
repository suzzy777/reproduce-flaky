This test seems to be racy. For some reason the shutdown process in the default executor stalls. Sometimes the executor manages to quit (well, segfault) before the agent tries to resend the last task status update, but sometimes not, which leads to the test failure. It seems that the executor should not hang during termination, which may indicate a bug in the executor and not just in the test.
