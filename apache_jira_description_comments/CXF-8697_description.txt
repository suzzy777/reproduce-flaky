The tests {{org.apache.cxf.io.CacheAndWriteOutputStreamTest.testDeleteTmpFile}} and {{org.apache.cxf.io.CachedOutputStreamTest.testDeleteTmpFile}} fail when run by themselves with the command {{mvn test}} because the temporary file is null. The reason is because {{createFileOutPutStream}} is never called in the method {{enforceLimits}} in the {{CachedOutputStream}} class since the {{threshold}} instance variable is not greater than the {{totalLength}} variable. The threshold variable depends on the static variable {{{}defaultThreshold{}}}. The {{defaultThreshold}} also depends on the system property. Therefore, these tests pass when the whole test suite is run because a different test, such as {{testUseSysProps,}} changes the static variable along with the system property.
