Is it possible to include the failed run on develop branch?

I'll run it again (in my GCP instance) and keep the artifacts. I'm not sure how to attach the artifacts to this Jira, but I'll let you know when I have them.

I've attached {{auth-expiration-artifacts.tgz}} with the results of running this one test 100 times via {{{}repeatUpgradeTest{}}}. The file has the test report and the content of all of the working dirs.

Ah, thanks! Somehow I thought the line that was failing is trying to assert the data region is empty, but it's actually the line that asserting the client proxy session is empty. Will have a fix soon....
