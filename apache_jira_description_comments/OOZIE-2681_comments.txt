It might also make sense to modify test-patch to catch these so we don't keep introducing them without knowing.

[~rkanter] Can you please take a look. Thanks.

[~abhishekbafna] those are flaky tests, +1 from my side (non-binding).

[~rkanter] Since FindBugs uses bytecode, it cannot analyze Javadoc. For that we'd need CheckStyle.

Thanks [~andras.piros] for the review on RB. [~satishsaley] can you please take look? Thanks.

+1 (non-binding)

Thanks [~asasvari] for the review. [~gezapeti] and [~pbacsko] Can you please take a look? Thanks.

[~abhishekbafna], Could you rebase the patch? It's not applying to the master anymore because of changes in ActionXCommand and SparkMain.

Looks good, I just have a single comment. Some grammatical mistakes should be fixed, like "if any error" should be " if any error occurs".

Example:
"if any error suspending the jobs" should be "if any error occurs while suspending the jobs".

There some mistakes like this scattered around the code. Not a big deal, but should be fixed nonetheless. Thanks.


[~pbacsko] I will take a another look and fix them. Thanks.

[~pbacsko] and [~gezapeti] updated the patch. Please have a look. Thanks.

{color:red}-1{color} Patch failed to apply to head of branch

----------------------------

I've just found this Jira. This would cover a lot of other issues as well. I've taken the liberty of picking this up due to the lack of response since March.
I'm attaching a fix.

The patch fixes every warning on the current master. I've provided meaningful javadoc where I could. [~pbacsko], [~asasvari], [~andras.piros], please review this.

If this gets committed, I'd like to give credit to [~dbist13] and [~abhishekbafna] in the commit message as they've also worked on fixing these issues.

Patch 07 reverts the change in OOZIE-2487, so future builds will break if there are javadoc warnings introduced.
