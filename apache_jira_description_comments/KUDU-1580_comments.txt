This seems to be causing relatively high flakiness of raft_consensus-itest's MultiThreadedInsertWithFailovers test case, unless I bump the rpc negotiation timeout up. I'll apply that workaround temporarily and leave a pointer to this JIRA.

We also see this frequently in real cluster testing under load, especially since the negotiation timeout is 3sec by default.

Fixed with e3c5dd18c22b9e20358f05dcd301e7736c0a3321
