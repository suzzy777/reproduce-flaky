GetJournalEditServlet uses request.getRemoteuser() to determine the remoteShortName for Kerberos authorization, which fails to match when the JournalNode uses its own Kerberos principal (e.g. jn/<hostname>@<realm>).

This can be fixed by using the UserGroupInformation provided by the base DfsServlet class using the getUGI(request, conf) call.
