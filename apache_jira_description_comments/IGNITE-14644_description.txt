See https://ignite.apache.org/docs/latest/net-specific/net-troubleshooting#stack-smashing-detected-dotnet-terminated:
On Linux, Java overwrites SIGSEGV handler installed by .NET, so NullReferenceException causes a scary "Stack smashing detected" error, which can be fixed by setting COMPlus_EnableAlternateStackCheck environment variable.

Write a suggestion to the log if all of the following is true:
* OS is Linux (or macOS? Check this)
* Runtime version is 3.0 or later
* COMPlus_EnableAlternateStackCheck is not set
