During the destruction of {{Cache}} the pointer to {{CacheImpl}} is invalid. Calls from {{ClientMetadataService}} attempt to access {{Pool}} instances through the {{Cache}} instance rather than {{CacheImpl}} resulting in access violation. This issue is timing dependent and isn't always reproducible.
