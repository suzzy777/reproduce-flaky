Obs.: 
 # I don't know yet if this indicates a problem with just the test or a problem with the core engine. The ticket needs to be updated accordingly after determining that
 # The test seems to run fine on Apache CI (but the worker node there is very slow)

[~davsclaus] any ideas how we can make this one reliable?

The test can be flaky if any of the 2 first messages are processed faster (1s delay) than the 3rd is being processed by wiretap, which would then have room in the pool, and not cause it to abort.

I did a PR with an improved test that uses barrier / latch to control the order. Its not flaky for me with repeat test.
