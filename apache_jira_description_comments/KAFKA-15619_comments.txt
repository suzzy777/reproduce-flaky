[~dengziming], I'd like to get more info why the [PR|https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12590] will make the deleted topics back? Because we're trying to close the fetch session, and while it's closing, it found the topic is deleted, so AUTO create it? Does the broker enable "auto.create.topics.enable"?

[~showuon] Yes, the stress test is using default config and 'auto.create.topics.enable' is true, after set this config to false the test no longer fails. I guess we will send a fetch request when closing and the ConsumerMetadata is not up to date, so the deleted topics are still in the fetch request.

auto.create.topics.enable means that _metadata requests_ cause topics to be created. It looks like the stress test is likely to be flaky with auto topic creation independently of the change in 3.6 (but it's probably worse with the change in 3.6).

So, in this case, I think it works as designed. For the test, it might need to wait until consumer/producer closed, then delete the topic, otherwise, it's possible the topic will be AUTO created. WDYT?

Hello [~showuon] , As [~ijuma] mentioned, auto.create.topics.enable only affect `MetadataRequest`, we should firstly locate where are we sending this `MetadataRequest` which creates the deleted topic automatically.    

This has been fixed after setting auto.create.topics.enable=false.
