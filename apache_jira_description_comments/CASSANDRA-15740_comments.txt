Only minor concern I have is the assert inÂ writeFileToChannel that checks the bytes read are what you asked for, I would personally just throw an exception there.

Other than that (and feel free to ignore), patch looks good to me +1.

For some reason I can't appear to load the dtest results, if the newly added dtest passes please merge.

Thanks for the review [~jolynch]. I addressed your concern. The CircleCI links are having some issues. The unit, in-jvm dtests and python dtests passed (with 1 flaky failure and 1 test tear down failure).
