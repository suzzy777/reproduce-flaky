I believe it could be related to an internal "throttling" mechanism that was added to improve throughput.

Can you try to set config

{{\_\_emit.interval.ms.kstreams.outer.join.spurious.results.fix\_\_}}

to zero to see if it resolve the issue?

Thank you for your comment.

There is unfortunately no improvement.

 

I tested it with the following:

 
 _{color:#6a3e3e}props{color}{color:#000000}.put(StreamsConfig.InternalConfig.{color}{color:#0000c0}EMIT_INTERVAL_MS_KSTREAMS_OUTER_JOIN_SPURIOUS_RESULTS_FIX{color}{color:#000000}, 0);{color}_
 

At startup I get the following warning: 
{quote}_WARN 25120 --- [           main] o.a.k.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig    : These configurations '[specific.avro.reader, schema.registry.url, __emit.interval.ms.kstreams.outer.join.spurious.results.fix__]' were supplied but are not used yet._
{quote}
 

I use the following joinwindow:

   ### JoinWindow size: 20000ms
   ### JoinWindow before: 20000ms
   ### JoinWindow after: 0ms

 

Started with empty topics:

Test1:  

streamA.leftjoin( streamB);

put message on streamA  (key1, a1)
wait 5000ms
put message on streamA (key1, a2)

expected join-record (key1, null) but there is not.

Thanks. I did look into this and found this PR: [https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/03411ca28b21d554d754b3f67a7857afe64f5bef]

It introduces `joinSpuriousLookBackTimeMs` but it seems it sets it to before/after for the left/right join node incorrectly – I think it must be flipped... The added unit tests seems to make incorrect assumptions when a window should get closed, but it was not caught during review (it's easy to flip before/after in your mind...)

Hence, the fix itself is simple, but updating the unit test is a little bit more work. Would you be interested to work on a PR to fix it?

Yes, I think it was incorrect and flipped.

Sure, I can give it a try to work on a PR.

 

 

Thanks a lot! Assigned the ticket to you.

There is a PR submitted for this:  [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/14426]

 

Not only the joinSpuriousLookBackTimeMs was flipped. 
Also I think that the emit-logic should come after the join-logic. 
Because only then you can determine whether you need to emit non-joined items or not.
Otherwise you will always emit non-joined items, even if there is found a joined item.

;)

 

What to do with "Flaky tests"?

 

I do not think my PR has anything to do with it.

 

Just commit and try again and pray?
