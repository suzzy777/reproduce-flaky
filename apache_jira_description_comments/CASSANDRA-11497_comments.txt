[~stefania], I've bumped up num_records on this test twice, and it continues to fail. Could this be a bug? Or do we just need to make it *much* higher?

I think we have the opposite problem right now, the compaction hasn't started yet, in that no temporary files are created before we kill the process. We still have all old files.

We may need to redesign this test. I think it is a mistake to treat as deterministic something that we cannot control (how far compaction has got when we kill the process).

We could kill the C* process at a random point in time (compaction_start + delta_milliseconds). Ideally we should repeat this test multiple times, but even if we repeat it only once, eventually over multiple dtest runs, if there is a problem we should find out. We remove the check on temporary files being present after killing the process, instead we log how many temporary files there are.  We continue checking that temporary files are cleaned up after invoking sstableutil and after the process is restarted, since this is what we care about. 

What do you think? I can work on the pull request if you agree.


I agree that it seems attempting to control the state of the compaction is proving inconsistent. I agree that checking that that any temp files have been cleaned up after invoking sstableutil and the process is restarted is sufficient.

Thanks, I will change the test as described.
