[~dengziming] this passes in CI. Can you elaborate how you run the tests?

[~hyukjin.kwon]
 # I'm using maven 3.6.3 and run `mvn clean test` but got a `java.lang.AssertionError at org.apache.spark.launcher.SparkLauncherSuite.testSparkLauncherGetError(SparkLauncherSuite.java:274)`
 # I run test test in IDEA and got the same error.

Would you mind sharing the full logs? Meanwhile, it might be helpful to take a look for https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html about who to run a test.

[~dengziming] Could you pls unset SPARK_HOME before running tests? The existing spark polluted the env.
