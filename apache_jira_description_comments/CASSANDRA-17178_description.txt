Java11 introduces new protection domains for package private methods, so that classes loaded with different class loaders may not access each othersâ€™ package private methods, regardless of the package they are declared within. There are differences within the JDK also, and there may be byte weaving targets that need updating (ThreadLocalRandom was one that has been handled)
