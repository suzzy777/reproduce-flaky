[~chenchun], thanks for your patch. The patch should work fine.
Maybe a more standard way is to use the {{AMRMClient#getMatchingRequests}} to find out the matching resourceRequest and then call the removeContainerRequest method ?

Thanks for review, [~jianhe] , upload a new patch addressing your comments. 

Looking at the patch again, I think other applications using AMRMClientImpl might have the same issue if it didn’t explicit call removeContainerRequest. IMHO, It is better if we can fix the issue within AMRMClientImpl. Any thoughts?

bq.  I think other applications using AMRMClientImpl might have the same issue if it didn’t explicit call removeContainerRequest. IMHO, It is better if we can fix the issue within AMRMClientImpl.
It is indeed expected that applications make a decision on what to cancel and what to retain.

Assigning this to you. Please add a test-case. We have too many integration tests for DistributedShell. Let's start making unit-tests.

Thanks for the comments [~vinodkv]. Will upload a new patch with test case after YARN-3749 fixed.

Upload YARN-2674.3.patch with a test case and more detailed comments.

[~chenchun] The patch seems to be stale now. Could you update it?

[~chenchun] - Thanks for the patch here. We are seeing this when testing the Docker runtime and it results in extra Docker containers being launched on RM restart, which is problematic. I've validated that the logic in this patch resolves that issue. Any chance you'd be able to update the patch? If you don't have the time, I could put up a patch based on your previous patch.

[~shanekumpf@gmail.com] Please catch on the work here. I no longer work on yarn any more.

Thanks, I'll work to put up a rebased patched.

Attaching a patch based on [~chenchun]'s previous work. I did not include the mini cluster based RM failover integration test as the allocation test appears sufficient here. The existing mini cluster based integration tests take quite a while to run already, so I'm not keen to add another. If others feel that test is needed, I'll can add it.

Thanks [~shanekumpf@gmail.com] +1. Patch LGTM.

Thanks for the review [~suma.shivaprasad]! The failed test passes locally, the DistributedShell tests are flaky. I've been looking at improvements to these tests and will open new issues where appropriate. 

I've spent some time looking into what issues are already opened for dshell tests and most of the flaky tests are being tracked.

YARN-7771 - Intermittent failures of tests that leverage TestDistributedShell#testDSShell
 YARN-8078 - TestDistributedShell#testDSShellWithoutDomainV2 fails on trunk
 YARN-6479 - TestDistributedShell.testDSShellWithoutDomainV1_5 fails
 YARN-4385 - TestDistributedShell times out

With these known flaky tests commented out, I've still yet to get 20 successful runs of the dshell tests. I'll continue to look into the tests as time permits, but I think we can move forward with this patch in the meantime.

Hey [~shanekumpf@gmail.com], thanks for taking up this patch. It looks like a pretty straightforward improvement. I think one additional thing we should do is have the AM release the surplus containers.

Thanks for the review [~billie.rinaldi]! I have attached a new patch to address releasing the surplus containers.
