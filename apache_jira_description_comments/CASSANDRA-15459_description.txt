[DTest to reproduce|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/compare/master...jasonstack:srp_group_by_trunk?expand=1]: it affects all versions..

{code}
In a two-node cluster with RF = 2

Execute only on Node1:
* Insert pk=1 and ck=1 with timestamp 9
* Delete pk=0 and ck=0 with timestamp 10
* Insert pk=2 and ck=2 with timestamp 9

Execute only on Node2:
* Delete pk=1 and ck=1 with timestamp 10
* Insert pk=0 and ck=0 with timestamp 9
* Delete pk=2 and ck=2 with timestamp 10

Query: "SELECT pk, c FROM %s GROUP BY pk LIMIT 1"
* Expect no live data, but got [0, 0]
{code}


Note: for group-by queries, SRP should use "group counted" to calculate limits used for SRP query, rather than "row counted".
