The travis build of profile spark-1.6 and scala-2.11 only test the embedded mode of spark instead real spark binary distribution of spark 1.6 with scala-2.11, so IMHO it is safe for us to just remove that build.Â

    @zjffdu It looks like this commit broke the master build on Travis.

    @SleepyThread How does it broke the master build ? There's some flaky test in zeppelin, it is normal is you see some failed test, community is working on that to fix these flaky test to make travis build stable.
