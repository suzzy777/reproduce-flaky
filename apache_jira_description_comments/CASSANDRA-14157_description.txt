test_tracing_does_not_interfere_with_digest_calculation - cql_tracing_test.TestCqlTracing failed it's assertion once today in a circleci run. the dtests were running against trunk.

Although it has failed once so far, a quick read of the comments in the test seems to indicate that the assertion failing this way might mean that CASSANDRA-13964 didn't fully fix the issue.
