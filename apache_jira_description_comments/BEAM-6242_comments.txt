The parallelism is 16 in the failing test:
{noformat}
[[1]write/Write/WriteImpl/FinalizeWrite (12/16)] INFO org.apache.flink.runtime.taskmanager.Task - Ensuring all FileSystem streams are closed for task [1]write/Write/WriteImpl/FinalizeWrite (12/16) (c3118bed611a7d1a310428fb1126f992) [FINISHED]{noformat}

Ah, because parallelism is only set to 1 for batch. We might have to decrease the parallelism also ins streaming or add the {{--environment_cache_millis=10000}} fix.

We did not change any parameter for streaming test in PR [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7174] but the failure is in streaming test case. 

Also the failure is permanent and not flaky.

However, we should control this know issue of file visibility in docker by controlling the parallelism for streaming as well.

If I'm not mistaken we did change the {{--experiments=worker_threads}} parameters in the PR.

I agree that we should fix the parallelism and not let it depend on the number of cores of the Jenkins worker. It makes the tests more repeatable. However, the Wordcount file system issues can also be fixed by the caching parameter and not necessarily by limiting parallelism to 1.
