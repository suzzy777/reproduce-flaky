Another instance of this, on ubuntu16: https://jenkins.impala.io/job/gerrit-verify-dryrun/3946/

I can take a look

I'll see if I can repro locally.

Saw this recurring this weekend (30th March).

IMPALA-8336: fix flaky ORC memory limit test

Reduces the mem_limit for the ORC version of the
test, which has proven to be flaky.

Testing:
Looped the test for a while locally without any failures.

I was unable to reproduce the failure seen on CentOS6 jenkins locally,
so we'll just try this tweak and see if it improves this. If not
I can look deeper into it.
