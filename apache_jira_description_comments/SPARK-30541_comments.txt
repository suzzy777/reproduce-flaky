Please see the PR. This is decided to be a blocker for 3.0.0.

As I see there are 2 problems:
 * Kafka broker is not coming up in time: I've had discussion with the Kafka guys and their solution to this is to execute their test with retry
 * Client not found in Kerberos database: which is reproduced here: [https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27810]

I'm going to attach the logs for the second problem here not because jenkins results going to disappear.

 

Going to check them next week...

The first problem is obvious, Kafka is not coming up all the time consistently. I think not much to do there unless Kafka community is fixing the issue. As a temporary solution retry can be used in the test.

 
The second problem is also coming from the Kafka side:
{code:java}
[info]   Cause: org.apache.kafka.common.KafkaException: javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: Client not found in Kerberos database (6) - Client not found in Kerberos database
{code}

When I've reproduced the issue locally I've realised that:
* KDC didn't throw any exception while the mentioned user created
* The keytab file is readable and able to do kinit with it

Maybe it's another flaky behaviour on the Kafka side?!

All in all since the broker is flaky and KafkaAdminClient shown also some flakyness my suggestion is to use testRetry until the mentioned problems are not solved in Kafka.
