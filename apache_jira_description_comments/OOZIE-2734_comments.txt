Look also at:
* Apache Drill, HBase, Spark documentation, how these are generated
* Jekyll
* AsciiDocs

It would also be good to integrate the following cwiki docs as part of the regular documentation during this exercise. They have very good information.

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOZIE/Java+Cookbook
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOZIE/Map+Reduce+Cookbook
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOZIE/Pig+Cookbook

Came across Apache Ignite documentation today - https://ignite.apache.org/ and it looks really good. We should check that out as well.

The Apache Ignite docs look really nice, but it looks like they're actually hosted by http://readme.io, so I don't think that would work for us.

I was also talking with [~gezapeti], and he tried out a few autoconverting tools and they weren't very good.  It's probably best to just start from scratch.  That would also allow whoever does it to reorganize things as they go through it, but they can still copy-paste large portions of the existing docs contents.

Another option we shouldn't overlook is the newer maven-site-plugin.  We're currently on some funny version of 2.x, but the latest version is 3.x and was presumably used to generate it's own website, which looks perfectly fine: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/index.html.  Looks like it supports a variety of formats: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/examples/creating-content.html#Documentation_formats

Most possibly it's best to convert TWiki to HTML first, then HTML to Markdown, for the sake of keeping manual effort to a bare minimum.

I've tried the listed tools without much success. It might be a limitation of the tools, but the fact that the oozie twiki documentation contains errors is also a problem for the tools.

Unfortunately sometimes it means that information is missing from the HTML version of the documentation, so using the HTML files as a source of the conversation is probably not the best idea.

I created my own tool to convert the twiki documentations to markdown and handle the errors and special cases. The script uses sed (in retrospect it was not the best idea). I upload the current version of the script, but check it only at your own risk.

There are long lines and tabs in the patch, because the documentation contains lots of preformatted parts.

A few comments about my patch:
 * I've updated quite a few maven plugins used during the site creation, so we also address OOZIE-3164
 * A customised version of the twiki pugin was used for HTML creation (because of special colors and table of contents), there is no need for a customised plugin for markdown
 * To avoid using a customised plugin I've changed a few header formatting levels. For instance twiki was using a header3 sometimes with a special flag to avoid the header to appear in the table of contents. I use a simple bold formatting instead.
 * HTML generation from Markdown is quite strict compared to the HTML generation from Twiki. If the input file is not syntactically correct sometimes it just gives an error message instead of creating a semi-correct HTML file.

I uploaded a zip which contains the HTML generated from the twiki and from the markdown documentation.

Thanks for checking [~pbacsko] my last patch (OOZIE-2734-3.patch) contains the fixes.

Thanks for the work you've been put into this [~asalamon74]! I'll check this out soon

So the precommit downloads the latest attachment. It's usually not a problem, but in this case the ZIP does not applies as a patch. no surprise there.

Oh yeah - that's a limitation we run into every so often.  It always tries to grab the newest attachement, and doesn't check the type.  So it's best to attach any other files first, and then the patch file last.

Thank you [~rkanter] for the tip. Next time I'll upload the HTML samples first and the patch only after that.

I get an error when I execute mvn clean install site:

We get the RAT warning because of the README.md file (which replaces the old README.txt). I think we can ignore it.

Thanks for the contribution [~asalamon74]! +1

Committed to {{master}}.

[~asalamon74] please take care about following in an amendment patch:
# {{README.txt}} should be renamed to {{README.md}}
# all items from [*TWiki folder*|https://github.com/apache/oozie/tree/master/docs/src/site/twiki] have to be renamed and moved to [*Markdown folder*|https://github.com/apache/oozie/tree/master/docs/src/site/markdown]

[~andras.piros] Uploaded the amend patch.

Thanks again for the quick fix [~asalamon74]! Committed amendment patch to {{master}}

Current {{master}} doesn't recognize {{README.md}} as an exclude for RAT checks, hence a RAT warning.
