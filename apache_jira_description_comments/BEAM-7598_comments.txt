Thanks, [~udim]. Assigning to Mark who is looking into a similar failure. 

[~markflyhigh] feel free to deduplicate if you think it is the same as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7527

It looks like the different problem. The log of this failed task is pretty short and didn't contain much details. It probably related to parallel execution after first look.

Here is the actual reason:

Run script run_integration_test.sh will build tar ball automatically if can't find it from sdk_location. However, this build process can't be paralleled since it uses shared temporary workspace. Since DirectRunner tests don't need tar ball, those test tasks don't depend on `sdist` and the build tar ball will be triggered during parallel run with py35, py36, py37 suites. That's the reason flaky happened randomly among direct runner test suites.

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8916 should fix it.
