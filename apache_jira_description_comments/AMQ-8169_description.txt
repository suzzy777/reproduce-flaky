The StompNIOSSL test fails during CI/CD tests with certain JDK versions. This blocks PR's from getting a green status

To reproduce:

[x] Fails with jdk1.8.0_281
[x] Passes with jdk1.8.0_211

Suspects:

* The test SSL cert needs to be generated with a newer cipher and/or length 
* The NIOSSLTransport has a bad byte[] read bug
