Seems the failed query is {{select a.key from t3 a left semi join t2 b on a.key = b.key right outer join t1 c on a.key = c.key sort by a.key}}. Since broadcast outer join is a relative new operator, [~kai-zeng] can you take a look at it.

The Physical plan looks very strange, it use unsafe BroadcastHashOuterJoin and BroadcastLeftSemiJoinHash, but use safe Projection (which should be TungstenProjection). I tried locally, it does use TungstenProject.

Is it possible that conf.unsafeEnabled is flaky? (changed by some tests)
