On cache restart all IgniteCacheProxy instances must be reset in order to reuse them.
But bunch of methods in IgniteCache interface including withKeepBinary create new instances of proxy for each call and these instances are not reset on cache restart. 
E.g. it leads to CacheStoppedException when reusing them after restoring from snapshot.
