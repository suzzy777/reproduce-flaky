In order to prepare for YARN's [*rack-schedulable AM feature*|YARN-6050], and [*its MapReduce counterpart*|MAPREDUCE-6871], let's have the possibility of making the Launcher Mapper map-only job's [{{InputFormat}}|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/InputFormat.java] class pluggable in order to provide alternative implementations that can behave differently from [{{OozieLauncherInputFormat}}|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/sharelib/oozie/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/OozieLauncherInputFormat.java] that does not request any HDFS resources.
