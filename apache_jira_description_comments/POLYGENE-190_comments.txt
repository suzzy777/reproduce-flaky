I agree. The original design was rushed together too quickly and is tied too much to the CodaHale/Yammer metrics library, instead of doing the "Qi4j Way" going to the bottom of the actual needs and the unique ways that this platform can bring this to the users.

Naming metrics is an application concern, the Metrics API now only require a single String for metrics names and provide a helper to build metric names using "structure paths".

Both the built in {{UnitOfWork}} metrics and the {{metrics}} library produce "structure path" based names using the added helper.

Along the way I fixed the existing metrics tests flakiness. We should not see any more randomly failed tests on CI.

This is now on {{develop}}, resolving the issue.
