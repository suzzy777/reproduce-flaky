This also caused a failure of org.apache.solr.handler.admin.LoggingHandlerTest when building a RC. 

This test fails for me as well.

I already opened a Jira for this error. Looks like the folder recently changed names though. I haven't seen this cause test failures unless it's the new name?

SOLR-14078

Noble might be able to comment on the failure. I switched it back to filestore after it was briefly switched to .filestore. Kevin, IIUC, old name was fine with that test?

I'm looking into it, as Noble will only be back online after 6-8 hours.

This test is flaky (that's one thing). The exception is just sprinkles on top. I don't think it's the cause of the failure. Async logging handlers in log4j are probably responsible for test failures - on slower machines it'll break.

David, you mean LoggingHandlerTest is flaky and unrelated to that security exception with the filestore? (Sorry, I just saw both thse issues just now, trying to parse the context.)

I just beasted this test, and seems to pass. What could be happening is that TestDistribPackageStore is setting -Denable.packages.true, but not unsetting it. So, while that doesn't cause failure in TestDistribPackageStore, but is causing failure in some other test sharing that JVM.

While it is bad that TestDistribPackageStore itself is not failing, I'm going to unset that property to make sure other tests remain fine.

Yes, I believe these are unrelated things. LoggingHandlerTest sometimes succeeds even if the exception is still thrown/ reported inside.

[~dweiss], [~krisden], I just commented on SOLR-14084, about another directory that is being created. Tests are passing for me that deal with this directory. Is there action now that needs to be taken about this or is this something can be cleaned up after the 8.4 release?

[~dweiss], are you using the latest commits? I see that your test reports ".filestore", which has now been changed to "filestore". Can you please do a "git pull" to see if that still persists?

FYI, I've pushed a fix to stop proliferation of the "enable.packages" property to other tests. I've pushed to master and branch_8x, and will push to branch_8_4 after running the full tests.

SOLR-14096: Stopping -Denable.packages=true from leaking to other tests


[~jpountz], while LoggingHandlerTest failed because of some flakiness, at least you might not see the filestore related security exceptions in that test after the above fix.

Test properties -are- should be restored by a test rule in the superclass. This ensures they're cleared properly for all tests, not just this one.

Yes, the problem with access denied still persists - that directory isn't accessible for writes, it's not about the name of the file but the location where it's attempted to be created.

Oops.. should we re-open?

Yes. Run it locally, you'll see the same exception (run it with ant, not IDE so that security manager and build locations are set properly).

{quote}bq. Async logging handlers in log4j are probably responsible for test failures - on slower machines it'll break
{quote}
It should be adequate to call
{code:java}
StartupLoggingUtils.flushAllLoggers() {code}
before looking to see if a log message has been written. I _might_ have put in some retry logic other times I saw this, if so don't use them as a pattern, they should be changed to call the above.

bq. Run it locally, you'll see the same exception (run it with ant, not IDE so that security manager and build locations are set properly).
I'm unable to reproduce it at all. I tried the following:

{code}
ant -Dtests.jvms=40 -Dtests.useSecurityManager=true test

ant -Dtests.dups=10 -Dtests.iters=10 -Dbeast.iters=10 -Dtestcase=LoggingHandlerTest beast

ant -Dtestcase=LoggingHandlerTest test
{code}

It always passes for me. I'm on Fedora 31,
{code}
Linux pseries 5.3.14-300.fc31.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Dec 2 15:41:35 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
{code}

The test will pass. The exception is still there. Failures are intermittent and only present in full test cycle under load. I can't reproduce in isolation as well.

FYI [~hossman] just found SOLR-14099 which explains a lot of the interaction between LoggingHandlerTest and the package stuff I think.

bq. This also caused a failure of org.apache.solr.handler.admin.LoggingHandlerTest when building a RC

To be clear, errors in logs relating to creating the {{.filestore}} directory don't seem to have anything to do with LoggingHandlerTest failing.

LoggingHandlerTest is one of many (all?) tests to have log messages complaining about  {{.filestore}} regardless of whether the test passes of fails -- the failures are realted to changes made in SOLR-13662 and how that aparently tickles a bug in the {{@logLevel}} annotation (SOLR-14099)

thanks to [~krisden] for noting hte connection

SOLR-14096: Stopping -Denable.packages=true from leaking to other tests


Ok so to recap.
* The LoggingHandlerTest issue is fixed in SOLR-14099.
* DistribPackageStore filestore creating a directory in the source tree is still wrong. 

I dug into DistribPackageStore in SOLR-14078 originally and found the following:

This is because of https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/solr/test-framework/src/java/org/apache/solr/SolrTestCaseJ4.java#L2098

The TEST_HOME is right from the base directory where "solr/collection1" is found.

If there are multiple tests doing stuff to TEST_HOME at once, this would definitely cause issues.

This also causes lucene-solr/solr/core/src/test-files/solr/userfiles which is following the same pattern. [~jbernste] dug into this more in SOLR-14084. 

So long story short - SolrTestCaseJ4 TEST_HOME needs to be fixed.

bq. So long story short - SolrTestCaseJ4 TEST_HOME needs to be fixed.

+1.

I see this same failure with SOLR-15268 TestEnumFields

The fix in SOLR-15369 takes care of this.

Closing after the 9.0.0 release
