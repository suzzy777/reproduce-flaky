[~gilbert] [~jieyu] Looks severe enough to be fixed for 1.3.0. Can you guys help triage this?

btw, tests in that file pass reliably on the same machine on 1.2.0 tag, so this must be related to whatever code happened afterwards.

Looks like a regression then from the 1.2 release. I am upgrading this to a Blocker.

Confirming this for Fedora 24. Healed this by wiping the build env.

I suspect the problem is that many tests which relies on Unified containerizer's docker store is using the default `/tmp/mesos/store/docker` rather than the test workdir.
