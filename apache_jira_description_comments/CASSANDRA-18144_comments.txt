Submitted PR to fix this issue: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/2107

Thank you for the patch, I just tried to push the patch to CI but I cannot access Jenkins in the moment. I will post CI run later

Also, normally whoever submits a patch moves the ticket to patch available to signal that it's ready for review. I almost missed your message in Slack.

Oh okay thanks for letting me know :) . 

-CI is running [here|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/2218/]-

New link - [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2189/workflows/49ac872c-a5bd-4547-be04-ea991e11afad]

NOTE: I pushed the tests in a loop with the free tier as it is a unit test fix and those can be run by anyone with free CircleCI access. Higher resources not needed

[~e.dimitrova] is the circleCI run completed? I have been checking it since yesterday, and it shows `On Hold` for the overall status. 

It shows on hold because I didn't start all jobs, but those I started are all green so at least CI does not have any complaints :-) 

Tested locally and see it passes with SkipList.  I found out that the reason why SkipList is passing is that AbstractShardedMemtable isn't used by SkipList and the issue is with AbstractShardedMemtable; the test is using tokens that don't match the partitioner, so the test was at fault to begin with

Hit this again today on https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jonmeredith/cassandra/746/workflows/5e928d77-0717-4ae0-ad1d-7883871c7f8e/jobs/5113 - do you have time for second commuter review [~e.dimitrova] or would you like me to pick it up?

Hey [~jonmeredith] , I helped to quickly push it to CI but I haven't looked into the code/problem. If you have cycles to help with the second review, I think it will be great! Thanks in advance!

+1 from me too. I'll commit.

This appears to have broken one of the dtests:

https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1473/testReport/dtest.replace_address_test/TestReplaceAddress/

Hey [~dchenbecker] , I believe we can close this one as it fixed a unit test and it cannot affect a Python DTest. I think the python DTest is probably a flaky one. I can see it actually failed twice in the past 30 runs.  

The failure is found [here|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1473/testReport/dtest.replace_address_test/TestReplaceAddress/test_fail_without_replace/].

It is a `{{TimeoutError}}` which we don't (re-)open tickets for, as described [here|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/Build+Lead]
{quote}
For failures with "Timeout …", we can ignore them , as it's considered test-infrastructure failures. …
{quote}

Open to suggestions on how to improve this, especially for new Build Leads figuring this out…

I just double-checked the commit [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/0a0e06847bf10aa88a3a30c239c507a64f949d74] and it only modifies the java test, so don't see how it could affect the Python dtest.

Spurious dtest failure misled to this ticket
