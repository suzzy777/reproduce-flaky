Playing around this morning, I seem to have hit an interesting bug.

{code}
releasedocmaker --project FALCON --outputdir FALCON --projecttitle 'Apache Falcon' --version 0 --version 1 --range --index --license
{code}

results in this URL getting generated:

{code}
https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/search?jql=project+in+%28%27FALCON%27%29+and++++++++++++++++fixVersion+in+%28%270.0%27%29+and++++++++++++++++resolution+%3D+Fixed&startAt=0&maxResults=100
{code}

A completely valid URL.  However,  RDM reports on the screen:

{code}
JIRA returns HTTP error 400: Bad Request. Aborting.
Please make sure the specified projects are correct.
{code}

 whereas JIRA spits back

{code}
{"errorMessages":["The value '0.0' does not exist for the field 'fixVersion'."],"errors":{}}
{code}

So somewhere we are generating an invalid version and not verifying it with JIRA. Additionally, our error message is wrong which isn't going to help the user at all.  :(
