    Fixed MasterQuotaTest.AvailableResourcesSingleDisconnectedAgent.

    In this test it was possible for the agent to retry registration
    either from the initial registration attempt's retry backoff loop,
    or from the master pinging it with the disconnected bit set. Pausing
    the clock prevents these issues.
