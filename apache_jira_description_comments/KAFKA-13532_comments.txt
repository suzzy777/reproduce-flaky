Thanks for this report, [~mjsax] . Do you know where this failed? I can't find a build with this test failing in it.

I looked in every branch build I could find, and didn't see any failures for this test. I think it's more likely that there was actually something wrong with whatever PR this was on (i.e., the failure was legit and not flaky).

Â 

Rather than leaving this hanging around, I'll go ahead and close it. We can re-open if it does start to pop up in a flaky fashion.
