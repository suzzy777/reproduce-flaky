We've seen Tomcat8SessionsClientServerDUnitTest.testExtraSessionsNotCreated fail with
a ConnectException

org.apache.geode.modules.session.Tomcat8SessionsClientServerDUnitTest > testExtraSessionsNotCreated FAILED
    java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)

        Caused by:
        java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)

This could be an environmental error, but if a pattern develops it could be due to a flaky test.
