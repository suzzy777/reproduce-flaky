This currently blocks backport of HBASE-22895 to branch-2.2

Pushed to branch-2.2 so I can resolve the parent issue and release 2.1.6.

Thanks [~jatsakthi].

Thanks [~Apache9]. Let me just link the adhoc run of the test change made by this jira, because in the github PR this test was skipped because of presence in the flaky list:Â [https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-adhoc-run-tests/29/]
