* Legacy Windows tests fail as expected (see IGNITE-15701)
* There are fewer tests than before in .NET Core Linux because obsolete ProjectFileTests were removed
* A few tests were disabled for further investigation: IGNITE-15710 

Successful build of the new "Platform .NET (Windows)" configuration: https://ci.ignite.apache.org/buildConfiguration/IgniteTests24Java8_PlatformNetWindows/6215816?buildTab=overview
