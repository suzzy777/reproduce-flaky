Basically regression was caused by tests itself which were not tolerant to change of an environment. And when environment got changed (count of core of CPU increases) they became fail. So I fixed it.

Also several problem were fixed as well:
 # iterator through connections in ConnectionManager is wrongly implemented
 # last usage time was not updated for statement cache , thus it was continuously cleared
