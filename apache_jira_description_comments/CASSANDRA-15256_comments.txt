LGTM. +1. Some notes for future readers:

Â {{getReplicas}}:
    - Was added as part of Transient Replication patch (CASSANDRA-14404)
    - Eventually calls {{getNaturalReplicasForToken(String, ByteBuffer)}} function just like {{getNaturalEndpoints}} does but with an additional check that the table exists (although it uses no metadata from this table) 
    - Does not include ports like {{getendpoints}} does. Although {{getendpoints}} uses the deprecated method {{getNaturalEndpoints}} it has an option to use the replacement {{getNaturalEndpointsWithPort}}

Other Changes:
- HandoffWindow (added in CASSANDRA-13728) was duplicate of GetMaxHintWindow (added in  CASSANDRA-11720) which is more conventional naming
- Removes duplicate DisableAuditLog listing


Rebased on a recent trunk here: https://github.com/jrwest/cassandra/commits/nodetool_cleanup

New build started here: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jrwest/cassandra/11/workflows/705761a6-389b-4c4e-a755-3ee1aecc4bf2

Test failure notes:
- the only java8 unit test failure is unrelated / flaky (no use of Nodetool in the test)
- dtest failure test_refresh_size_estimates_clears_invalid_entries is known
