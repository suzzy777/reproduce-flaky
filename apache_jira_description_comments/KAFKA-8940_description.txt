The test does not properly account for windowing. See this comment for full details.

We can patch this test by fixing the timestamps of the input data to avoid crossing over a window boundary, or account for this when verifying the output. Since we have access to the input data it should be possible to compute whether/when we do cross a window boundary, and adjust the expected output accordingly
