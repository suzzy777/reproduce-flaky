There may be some background threads outputting logs to stdout while ConsoleSinkSuite is running. Since ConsoleSinkSuite collects results from stdout and check them, it may fail.

I'm going to just delete ConsoleSinkSuite.

If we want to test ConsoleSinkSuite in future, we should refactoring ConsoleSink to make it testable instead of depending on stdout, because Spark may not stop some background threads at once and there is a race condition that other threads are outputting logs while ConsoleSinkSuite is running.
