Title originally was: Ferrying OpenTelemetry span/context via org.apache.cassandra.net.Message.Header

Lately I endeavored to integrateÂ [Jaeger with Cassandra|https://github.com/smok-serwis/cassandra-jaeger-tracing]. However, the only way to reliably sent messages across modes requires specifying a ParamType, which is limited only to an UUID, which is not enough to sent both the 128-bit spanId and parent, nevermind the baggage.

Is there any other way I can reliably send the data to other node using Message.Header?

Or could I alternatively coordinate with the Cassandra team to reserve an integer for the definite use of ferrying OpenTelemetry data?

I'v detailed my endeavors [here|https://henrietta.com.pl/index.php/2022/10/19/how-do-you-integrate-custom-tracing-with-cassandra/].
