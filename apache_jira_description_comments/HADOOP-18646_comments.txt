   have you updated the LICENSE-binary file as that was undermaintained and actually blocked last week's release?

   > have you updated the LICENSE-binary file as that was undermaintained and actually blocked last week's release?
   
   Sorry, I didn't know that it needed to be updated additionally. Now I have added the necessary changes to LICENSE-binary

   Right,
   
   I have just done the x86 RC this weekend and I am doing the arm64 one right now, and with a goal of putting the RC2 out for a vote buy about 17:00 UTC.
   
   Is the CVE something to which Hadoop is actually vulnerable to?
   
   Because we have lots of other issues and trying to keep every single transient jar up to date is a losing battle. If I hold off it will cost time and then something else will come up and I absolutely want to get this up for a vote by tomorrow. Also, last minute JAR updates are incredibly dangerous nobody will have any time to have tested the release for regressions. I am scared of them.
   
   I want to get this release out the way and then we can start worrying about what we do in a follow up in a few months time -which can absolutely take this update as it gives us the time to make sure this update works.
   
   So, please make the case for why this CVE should force the cancelling of the in-progress RC. Otherwise given all the other pressing issues we have to fix in this release I really want to say no.

   I don't have to jump on the outgoing train, you can put a fix in the next release, since the RC for the current one is already available.

   all the test failures are unrelated; we have jiras on these being flaky/brittle to timing issues.
   
   could you rebase as there's now merge problems with the license file...this will trigger a new run and we can see if the failures go away
