Looking into Jenkins it seems there was particular particular time when this test started failing

Last green was from CASSANDRA-17524, 

[#271|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-3.0/271/testReport/dtest.repair_tests.repair_test/TestRepair/] is the first Jenkins run when we see it failing, the legacy parsing fix from CASSANDRA-17581

There were also some fixes applied in the DTest repo somewhere in that time which revealed long time issues so probably worth to check that too.
