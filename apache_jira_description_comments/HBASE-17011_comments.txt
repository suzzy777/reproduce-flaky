[~carp84] since on 1.3.0RC0 I found flaky/broken compaction test (HBASE-16852) and looking, you guys want to piggy back on it and get this one to 1.3.0? Seems good to me at the moment (won't wait specifically, but would be ok to commit). Sorry for any additional labor that could have caused :) 

Sure, no problem, let me get this into 1.3.0. Thanks for the message sir [~mantonov]

Mark this JIRA as invalid and will commit to branch-1.3 in HBASE-16972 itself.
