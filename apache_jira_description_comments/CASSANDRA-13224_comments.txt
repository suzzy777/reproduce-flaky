It seems that the flaky tests [PendingRepairManagerTest|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/trunk/job/trunk_testall/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction/PendingRepairManagerTest/history/] (CASSANDRA-13207, CASSANDRA-13248) and [CompactionStrategyManagerPendingRepairTest|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/trunk/job/trunk_testall/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction/CompactionStrategyManagerPendingRepairTest/history/] (this and CASSANDRA-13206) have all a common root cause:
{noformat}
DEBUG [CompactionExecutor:4] 2017-02-20 15:10:45,045 Removing compaction strategy for pending repair c0921d40-f77e-11e6-9d70-e9c36734696d on  ks_1487603444905.tbl
{noformat}

Which seems to be caused by a race with auto-compactions triggered by flush, so the simple fix is to just disable autocompaction during these tests. I managed to reproduce this with [this multiplexer run|https://cassci.datastax.com/job/pauloricardomg-testall-multiplex/4/] and fixed by disabling autocompaction during tests: [fixed multiplexer run|https://cassci.datastax.com/job/pauloricardomg-testall-multiplex/5/]

Besides this, I also aborted transactions created by {{PendingRepairManager.getNextBackgroundTask}} after the assertions since they are causing {{LEAK DETECTED}} errors.

I am assuming (and hoping) you haven't started working on this yet so if you haven't done so would you mind reviewing this [~bdeggleston]? Otherwise I'm happy to review your patch if you already have one in place. Thanks!
