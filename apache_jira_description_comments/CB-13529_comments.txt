   Yeah, and the plugin is iOS only, so it's not useful to run Android tests on it

   We weren't running tests, we were just building it to make sure that project that has this plugin installed wouldn't fail Android build.
   I wonder if this check makes any sense at all üòú

   The plugin.xml only have iOS platform, so it shouldn't affect other platforms builds, but who knows.
   
   It was failing, I don't remember the error, but it was previous to adding the plugin
