Currently when a redis operation fails because one of the servers departed while it was in progress an exception is thrown that contains "memberDeparted". Clients are required to handle this non-standard error message and decide if the operation should be retried or not.

A better approach is to have the server close the client connection that the operation came in on. Some clients already handle this and support things like auto reconnect.Â
