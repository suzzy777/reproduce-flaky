Seems that the maintenance manager sometimes schedule strange compact ops as shown in the above log, these ops block flush ops because in the test tserver is configured with '--maintenance_manager_num_threads=1'(the default value).

KUDU-3354: Deflake DisableWriteWhenExceedingQuotaTest

I noticed that the TestDisableWritePrivilegeWhenExceedingSizeQuota
test failed some times in latest code review items because of test
timeout. From the test log we can see maintenance manager tends to
schedule a high score compact operation of some rowsets but do
nothing in the end because 'Compaction resulted in no output rows
(all input rows were GCed!)'. This leads to failures to schedule
flush operations and to hit the size limit until run out of time.

I think this weird high perf score most likely has something to do
with not explicitly initializing the 'value_' of RowsetInfo after
some debugging. The 'value_' can't be updated in FinalizeCDFVector()
either, because in the test scenario it has nearly one key in a
rowset, and the 'total_width' of the rowset is 0.

I run the test 10 times and see no failure with this fix, compared
to 5 failures without the fix but with a DCHECK[1] that indicates
the compaction error occurred in the test case.
