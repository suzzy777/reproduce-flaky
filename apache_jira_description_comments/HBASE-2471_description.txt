The "human unit tester" (Kannan) last night wondered what happens splitting logs and we come across an edit whose region has since been removed.  Taking a look, it looks like we'll create the output file and write the edits for the no-longer-extant region anyways.  This will leave litter in the filesystem -- region split files that will never be used nor removed.  This issue is about verifying that indeed this is whats happening (We do SequenceFile.createWriter with the overwrite flag set to true which tracing seems to mean create all intermediary directories -- to be verified) and if it indeed is happening, fixing split so unless the region dir exists, don't write out edits.. just drop them.
