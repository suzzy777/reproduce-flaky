According to the following documentation

[https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.1.2/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/ResourceModel.html]

oozie.launcher.override.memory.mb and oozie.launcher.override.vcores are outdated so the goal is to extend them with currently accepted property keys. 
The current keys should be in the beginning of the list to have the highest priority. Legacy overrides need to at end of the lists: oozie.launcher.mapreduce.map.memory.mb & oozie.launcher.mapreduce.map.cpu.vcores & oozie.launcher.mapreduce.map.java.opts

The old keys should *not* be deleted to preserve backward compatibility of Oozie and workflow configuration.
