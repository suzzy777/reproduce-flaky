Upon {{SLACalculatorMemory.addRegistration}}, Oozie puts an entry into an in-memory concurrent hashmap ("slaMap"), and later [persists it|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/50f4b5984832941f1341586e43fd832c293b3275/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/sla/SLACalculatorMemory.java#L380] in the Oozie database. 

However, if there is a failure during the database operation, a {{JPAExecutorException}} is thrown, and the entry [is not removed from the SLA map| https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/50f4b5984832941f1341586e43fd832c293b3275/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/sla/SLACalculatorMemory.java#L393].
It may introduce inconsistency between the Oozie database and the SLA map.

To prevent this, a rollback mechanism (with proper logging) should be implemented.  It would also make sense to do more sanity/consistency check in the Oozie server.
