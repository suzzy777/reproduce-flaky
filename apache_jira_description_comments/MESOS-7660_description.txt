If a framework accepts/refuses an offer using a very long filter, [the {{HierarchicalAllocator}} will use the default {{Filter}} instead|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/src/master/allocator/mesos/hierarchical.cpp#L1046-L1052]. Meaning that it will filter the resources for only 5 seconds.

This can happen when a framework sets {{Filter::refuse_seconds}} to a number of seconds [larger than what fits in {{Duration}}|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/13cae29e7832d8bb879c68847ad0df449d227f17/3rdparty/stout/include/stout/duration.hpp#L401-L405].

The following [tests are flaky|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-7514] because of this: {{ReservationTest.ReserveShareWithinRole}} and {{ReservationTest.PreventUnreservingAlienResources}}.
