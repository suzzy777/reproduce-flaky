{{TestDFSClientSocketSize}} has two tests that assert that a value that was set via {{java.net.Socket#setSendBufferSize}} is equal to the value subsequently returned by {{java.net.Socket#getSendBufferSize}}.

These tests are flaky when we run them. The occasionally fail.

This is expected behavior, actually, because {{Socket#setSendBufferSize()}}[is only a hint|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html#setSendBufferSize(int)].  (Similar to how the underlying libc {{setsockopt(SO_SNDBUF)}} works).
