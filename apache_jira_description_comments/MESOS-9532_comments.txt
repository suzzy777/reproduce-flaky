    Fixed flakiness by adding per agent config dir for mesos test.
    
    In mesos tests, there are some cases that multiple agents are
    running simultanuously. From commit 07bccc63, we start to have
    agents share the same config dir in the test sandbox. Unit
    tests that use the same credicial file dir may fail if there
    are agents read and write to the same credential file
    simultanuously. We should set unique dir per agent.
