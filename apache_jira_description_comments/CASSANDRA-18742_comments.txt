Failures are just flakes, one test all over again basically.

[~aleksey] would you mind to give it a shot?

I ll do the PR for trunk after this is reviewed, should be applied cleanly.

I have not removed crc_check_chance in this patch. The removal of that is more involved and I want to focus on its removal in a separate ticket. 

Looks good to me, but I'm not sure we should be modifying a flaky test if we aren't solving it.

The flaky test is a test method in AlterTest (1).

This patch was modifying AlterTest to be aligned with the proposed changes. Then, upon build, as our CircleCI scripting makes modified test classes to run in a loop, that unrelated test method was executed in a loop too. We have basically discovered a flaky test. We have not modified that test method in particular.

I see, that makes sense.  We should probably also run the upgrade tests for this, WDYT?

the flaky one is this one CASSANDRA-18360

OK will run upgrade and I ll provide the links here once done.

Started [upgrade tests|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1314/workflows/2acf15d3-5654-4e69-bf04-57c23138330c].

We are removing only {{chunk_length_kb}}, right?

The upgrade tests passed, which is a little worrisome given Maxim's point.

went through all the changes and the code base to make sure we didn't miss anything, it looks like everything is correct, so I'm +1 (nb)

I left a minor comment, but we can live without fixing it. :-)

OK, so I think we are done. [~brandon.williams] do you have anything to add? (ideally +1 :) )

+1 from me :)

to be extra sure, more tests, j11 precommit (1)
this (2) is 4.0 branch running dtests with the proposed dtest branch to check it will not break older branchesÂ

We need to merge this [https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/pull/237]

Jenkins builds:

[3.0|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/2627/#showFailuresLink]
[3.11|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/2628/#showFailuresLink]

I was manually testing affected tests locally for 5.0 and 2.2 branches.

+1 from me, I've checked the changes yesterday and they look good now. 

+1 on the dtest followup
