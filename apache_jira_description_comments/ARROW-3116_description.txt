Add a facility to list all the objects in the store and information about them (object ids, sizes, number of clients using them, status i.e. "sealed" or "unsealed", creating date, time it took to create). This is very useful for debugging applications.

This will be exposed by having client.list() in the python client, which will return a dict mapping object ids to the information.
