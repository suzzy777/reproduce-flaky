A recent investigation into a flaky test, IMPALA-5708, brought up the issue that the exec summary may not always be filled in for certain queries, even if the query is FINISHED.

For example, a query with a limit or subquery that internally cancels some fragments because they are no longer needed may never update the exec summary with info from those fragments.

We should investigate what guarantees we can make about when the exec summary will be present and add automated tests to check these guarantees.
