Encodes this String into a sequence of bytes using the platform's default charset, storing the result into a new byte array. The behavior of this method when this string cannot be encoded in the default charset is unspecified.

Since this is a distributed system, it is always possible that different nodes have different default charsets defined. I think it's most safe to specify it explicitly across all nodes for safety sake. You could for example see a situation where an upgrade JVM uses a different default and during a rolling upgrade of the JVM, different nodes now have a different default.

* The default charset is usually "ISO-8859-1". UTF-8 covers more of our international friends.
* Explicitly specifying the CharSet yields slight performance gains
* Explicitly specifying the CharSet removes the need for try/catch blocks of UnsupportedEncodingException
