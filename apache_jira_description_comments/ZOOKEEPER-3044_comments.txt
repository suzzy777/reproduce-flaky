Thanks Bogdan. I increased the maxmem to 3g. It's odd though, afaik that's the maxmem per jvm, including when the parallel threads get forked (each forked thread has maxmem heap).

Please reopen if you see this again. thanks.

Hm. 2g is the setting for the other jobs. So it's a bit unusual that only trunk is seeing this. Or are we seeing it elsewhere?

I've created a little [script|https://gist.github.com/lavacat/8bd89df1ece84ac8062bd444ba7d8c95] to check test results. 

Trunk java 10 is the most frequent: 6 failures in last 21 builds

Next is Trunk java 9: 2 failures in last 19 builds

Last is 3.5 java 8: 6 failures in last 40 builds (longer build history for this branch)

No 'OutOfMemoryError' on other branches. Interesting that there is nothing for Trunk java 8 build.

Hm. I just (as part of resolving this report) updated the java10 trunk build to use "latest" rather than "JDK 10 b36 (early access build)". When we originally setup the jenkins jdk10 job b36 was all that existed, now the job will always grab "latest" jdk10. Let's see if that changes things.

We are setting "maxmemory" as defined here (see build.xml for more details)
https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/junit.html
"Maximum amount of memory to allocate to the forked JVM. Ignored if fork is off."
It was 2g and now 3g. So that seems very odd to me. I'm worried we might have a leak....


[~bkanivets] if you're interested could you update the flakey test report to include this detail? (if so create a separate jira)

This job:
https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-Find-Flaky-Tests/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/report.html

The code for which is here:
https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/jenkins-tools/zk-test-report/zk_test_analyzer.py

Looks like you'd have to update it a bit to use the Jenkins json details rather than scraping the page, so not trivial.

However if we could include some details on the type of failure that might be interesting.

Thanks.
