This is filed under python SDK so I think I don't understand it. Can you add more information? Is this actually a runners-flink feature (or both components)?

This is a feature for Python's FlinkRunner. The java/Flink side of this already exists. 

Should this be marked as completed, or do we considerÂ BEAM-8512 a blocker?

Yes, this should be resolved.
