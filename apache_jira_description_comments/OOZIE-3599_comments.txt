[~medb] thanks for your patch.

 

Could you please use jetty version of 9.4.43.v20210629 and upload a new patch?

 

Also could you please check the failed unit tests? I think the root cause of the failures is related to Jetty version change:
{noformat}
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler {noformat}
Before uploading your new patch please run these test classes: [https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/PreCommit-OOZIE-Build/37/#showFailuresLink]

 

Thanks,

Denes
