Alex, I re-merged the ticket with master. Please confirm status of TC.

[~vozerov] TC looks fine to me, all tests that have failed appear to be flaky ones.

[~al.psc],
It seems that this fix conflicts with some other SQL change related to properties. Could you please re-merge from {{master}} and resolve the conflict?

[~vozerov] merged, TC is on the run.

Alex,
LGTM. I re-merged PR w/ {{master}} again and performed some minor fixes to error message logging. 
Could you please confirm that tests are fine?

Looks like .NET tests are broken by this commit: http://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=442967

[~al.psc] can you please have a look?

Also, I do not see a pull request here, can you please link it to the ticket?
