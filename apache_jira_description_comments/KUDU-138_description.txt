We're currently ignoring the timestamps on the commits on bootstrap, which is a problem.

Timestamps are assigned just after prepare completes, i.e. after all locks are acquired (and are therefore serialized in the same order as the OpIds). However these timestamps are ignored on bootstrap and instead replicas start a new Mvcc transaction which takes a new clock value (before used its own internal Mvcc value which meant the result was the same).

This means operation order is the same pre-/post- bootstrap but transactions may have different assigned timestamps which will make replicas disagree on what should be returned under a specific snapshot.
