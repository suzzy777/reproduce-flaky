[~gezapeti] Do we need one single global value, or maybe different default values for different action types?

I don't have strong opinions here. Having finer grain control is nice, but it might not worth the overhead in implementation and complexity this case.

Hi [~gezapeti], I'd like to work on this. 

My idea is:
 # Add a new global configuration {{oozie.service.LiteWorkflowStoreService.default.user.retry}}, through which admin can define default retry counts for all actions. 0 will be the default as it is the current behavior.
 # Change function {{org.apache.oozie.service.LiteWorkflowStoreService#getUserRetryMax}}, if {{retry-max}} was not defined in workflow xml, return the global configuration's value instead of constant 0.

Any thoughts? [~gezapeti]

 

[~asalamon74] Please have a look.

Sounds like a good plan to me. [~qsbao] I've added you to the contributor list, just assign this Jira to yourself if you start working on it.

Thanks for the quick patch [~qsbao] I like the approach, I only have a few suggestions:
 * It's a very good idea to check the default and the max and return max if default>max. I think we should also print out a warning message in this case.
 * The default 0 is hardwired twice in the code. Once in {{oozie-default.xml}} and once in the {{ConfigurationService.getInt(CONF_USER_RETRY_DEFAULT, 0);}} line. I think we only need to hardwire it only into the xml. Please check OOZIE-1890 and OOZIE-3462 for the reasons.
 * Can you please add some meaninful assert messages to your unit test asserts. 

[~asalamon74] Thanks for the reviewing, second patch submitted.
