As a result of debugging, I found that writers (threads that invoke *BplusTree#put* and *BplusTree#remove*) want to update one and the same page (*BplusLeafIo*), they need to acquire a writing lock for this page, but they fail (they do not have time) because readers (threads that invoke *BplusTree#size(TreeRowClosure)*) quickly acquire a reading lock for this page, *OffheapReadWriteLock* does not use a fair lock.

[~ibessonov] Please make code review.

[~ktkalenko@gridgain.com] thank you for the fix, I merged it to main branch.
