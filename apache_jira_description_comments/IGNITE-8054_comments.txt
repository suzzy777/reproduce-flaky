Hi [~sharpler], 

In general fix is looking ok, but there is blocker for me, it is tests results.

Tests failed: 391 (17 new)

How old is this PR? It is possible these tests were already fixed. So I suggest to rebase (merge) master to PR and re-run test.

It is possible impact change, so we need to be sure TC is in passing state after fix.

Please set Patch available state once we have new run-all

You are right, it was a bit old PR. I have done rebase and have made rerun on TC and got:

Tests failed: 64 (61 new)

But all of that failed tests looks like flaky.

I see many new flaky tests like *JdbcThinBulkLoadAtomicPartitionedNearSelfTest.testDefaultCharset* (only 75 runs and 6 of them are failed).

Â 

[~sharpler] tests look good now.

Hi [~sharpler], I've merged changes to master.

Let's keep an eye on TC results.

Thanks. I will.
