I'm running a build w/ sleep set to 10seconds.

I tried it and these failed:

{code}
Failed tests:   testOnlineChangeTableSchema(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestAdmin)
  testForceSplitMultiFamily(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestAdmin): expected:<2> but was:<1>
  testMergeTool(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.TestMergeTool): 'merging regions 0 and 1' failed with errCode -1
  testResetZooKeeperSession(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.TestReplicationPeer): ReplicationPeer ZooKeeper session was not properly expired.
{code}

The TestReplicationPeer might be related.

Seems that HBASE-1291 is on the same subject, and it says:

bq. We currently use 10 seconds for zookeeper.session.timeout. I tried bumping this down recently to 2 seconds, and it broke the tests. We need to investigate why this change breaks our test.

So the timeout have been increased somewhere...

I resolved hbase-1291 as dup of this.  Good one nkeywal.

Nicolas, you might want to take a look at thi sone.

TestZooKeeper#testClientSessionExpired() has a very similar piece of code, with a 15s timeout 'only'. 
But when i tried this value, I had a failure in TestFromClientSide... to be continued

Fixed in HBASE-4798. We now set a timeout for the zookeeper of 0,5s, then we wait 7 seconds. It works.

Fixed by hbase-4798
