    SAMZA-1388: Flaky test - TestStatefulTask#testShouldStartAndRestore

    I believe the problem originated from SAMZA-173.
    
    The core issue is testShouldRestoreStore was not updated to expect 6 messages after 2 more messages were added to testShouldStartTaskForFirstTime.
    
    Fixed the issue and refactored the code so the 2 methods wouldn't disagree again in the future.
