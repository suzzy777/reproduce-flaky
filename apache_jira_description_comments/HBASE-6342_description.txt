HBase trunk builds (and several others) have a set of known flaky tests.  We could setup the current jenkins builds, or the hadoopqa builds to run the known good set separately from the flaky set. 

This would be helpful because it would expose known flaky tests, reduce the noise due to flapping test runs, and potentially improve our discipline with unit tests and CI going forwards.
