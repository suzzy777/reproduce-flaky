Ah, this failure was noted in HBASE-8553.  

Are you still seeing this issue after 0.94.13?

Yes.  I ran these test against the apache 0.94.15 release and also the tip of 0.94 this morning.

[~yuzhihong@gmail.com] says this shows up here also: https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-0.94-on-Hadoop-2/1/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.hadoopbackport/TestInputSampler/testSplitSampler/

Here's a patch.
Checks whether TaskAttemptContext is an interface first (so there's no performance penalty in Hadoop 1.x). If it is it tries to create a TaskAttemptContextImpl (Hadoop 2.x).

Both tests pass with Hadoop 1 and 2 with this patch.

since this is 0.94 only, lgtm. (otherwise we'd go into those hadoop-compat modules).

Committed to 0.94 only.
Thanks Jon.

Now of course I see TestImportExport, TestTableMapReduce, and TestImportTsv with Hadoop 2 and 0.94

I believe on the internal cloudera test rigs we've marked them off as flaky.  

TestImportExport fails locally too (with Hadoop 2). I am having a hard time making them work with both Hadoop 1 and Hadoop 2.
(see also HBASE-6330, when I use the config from UTIL Hadoop 2 passes, but Hadoop 1 fails, when I use the config from the cluster Hadoop 1 and Hadoop 2 fails.
