Here's a quick draft of this feature against our branch 20. Will work on updating to trunk and adding some kind of tests.

Would appreciate feedback on the following:
- is the locking correct for updateMetrics? I take a lock on the scheduler and then the poolmanager, but no other locks.
- could it be finer grain? (do I need the coarse scheduler lock at all? unclear)

- should I add a configuration to disable the job-level metrics and only use pool-level metrics?
- when a user pool becomes empty, should we remove its metrics records?

Here's a patch against trunk with unit tests and docs. Above questions still stand.

Slightly improved patch - the main code is the same, but this fixes some flaky behavior in the tests. I previously wasn't unregistering the metrics updater in fairsched's termination method, so different test cases were interacting poorly with eachother.

This should be ready for review.

Rebased on trunk. Also fixes a bug where using "setPool" twice on a job would cause an NPE, since it would clean up the metrics on the first switch, and then NPE when cleaning it up again

+1 The patch looks good to me.
I think the failed tasks are unrelated.

Committed to trunk. Thanks for reviewing.
