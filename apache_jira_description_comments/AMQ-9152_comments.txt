AMQ-9152: Fix surefire setup to run all tests that are not excluded


[~mattrpav] and [~jbonofre] I figured the simplest thing here is to just go ahead and push this and see what breaks in CI and then go fix.

Note of course that surefire still has a default (though using that will now pick up the '*Tests' you mentioned specifically).

https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#includes

Makes sense there's a default filter like that. I had figured surefire was just trying to scan all of src/test/java for Junit annotations or something like if no include filter but the default includes list makes more sense from a performance standpoint.

[~cshannon] it makes sense. I will a new pass but we also have to improve CI/CD (too long, too flaky IMHO).

[~jbonofre] - We can also disable the tests if too slow or broken but the way it was it was inadvertently excluding tests that shouldn't be. We should explicitly exclude them with the exclude filter if they are flaky or fix them.

[~cshannon] fully agree. In the last PR build, we had couple of timeouts, but most of flaky failure. I will do a pass to exclude the guilty ;)

[~cshannon] good catch, definitely on-board with pushing it in now. 

I've been thinking about approaches on cleaning up the unit tests. A number of things like breaking some up into separate maven modules (performance-related tests, etc) 

Also, junit5 may help from a management perspective.. using @Disabled annotation vs rules in the pom. When working in the IDE it takes an extra work flow step to check the pom to know if a test is included or not in the maven build

Yeah we could def split things up, it would make it easier to run certain categories of tests that you care about for quicker feedback when developing.

I'm closing this as resolved as the tests are now running again. If there are specific tests that are broken or need to be ignored we can fix them in another Jira.

Tests keep timing out now after this so I opened a PR to increase the timeout, if that fails we will need to reopen this or create a new jira to hunt down which test is causing the build to always timeout with the error: *There was a timeout in the fork* : https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/930
