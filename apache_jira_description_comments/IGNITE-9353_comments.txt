[~Mmuzaf] Can you please approve?

Btw, what failure handler have you mentioned in the mailing list?

[~roman_s]

Changes looks good to me.

I've rerun and checked `Cache 8 Suite` with {{GridCacheRebalancingSyncSelfTest}}. Can you please look at it too?

{{org.apache.ignite.failure.FailureHandler}} is a common way of handling any exceptions, as well as dumping pending futures and deadlocked threads. Here is more about it -- [IEP-14|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/IGNITE/IEP-14+Ignite+failures+handling].

[~Mmuzaf] Thanks for checking Cache 8 Suite. Looks like we have a flaky test that is not related to this change.

Thanks for pointers to {{FailureHandler}}!
