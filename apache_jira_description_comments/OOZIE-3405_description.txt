Currently, when an SSH action fails the only message that is returned is the Status. Neither the {{error Message}} nor {{Error code}} fields are filled. This makes reporting on the causes of SSH Action failures via Oozie highly impractical: the only meaningful bit of information there is on a failed SSH Action is the Status.

The Status is filled based on the presence (or lack of) the {{.error file}} that is produced in case the user submitted script returns with any other value than 0.

 String outFile = getRemoteFileName(context, action, "error", false, true);
 String checkErrorCmd = SSH_COMMAND_BASE + action.getTrackerUri() + " ls " + outFile;
 int retVal = getReturnValue(checkErrorCmd);

 User requirement is to provide some more detailed information on the success/failure of the user-submitted script. That could be at a minimum the return value, optionally the last ~1K of the stderr that is drained. This information could then be communicated via {{errorMessage}} and {{ErrorCode}}
