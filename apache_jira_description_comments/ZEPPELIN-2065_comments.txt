    [ZEPPELIN-2065] Flaky test: NotebookTest.testSchedulePoolUsage

    ### What is this PR for?
    
    `testSchedulePoolUsage()` test checks that jobs can be executed several times in a row using a cron expression.
    
    It failed sometimes when it checked job completion by monitoring `job.dateFinished` and then tried to assert that `job.status` is `FINISHED`. It was not always true because `job.status` is changed after `job.dateFinished`.
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    Bug Fix
    
    ### Todos
    * [ ] We need to catch job completion by checking `job.status` instead of `job.dateFinished`.
    * [ ] It is better to catch job completion by adding job status change listener instead of using `Thread.sleep(..)` in a test method.
    * [ ] We can make this test simpler by removing a check that a job will not run after a cron expressin is removed. We already have such check in a previous unit test named `testSchedule()`.
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    [ZEPPELIN-2065](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2065)
    
    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update? **no**
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? **no**
    * Does this needs documentation? **no**

    I changed AtomicInteger to CountDownLatch to simplify the code.
