[~bernd-mesos] added this logic for extra info about a rare flaky test:
https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/d26baee1f377aedb148ad04cc004bb38b85ee4f6/src/tests/fetcher_cache_tests.cpp#L249-L259

This information is useful regardless of the test type and should be generalized for {{cluster::Slave}}.  i.e. 
# When a {{cluster::Slave}} is destructed, it can detect if the test has failed.  
# If so, navigate through its own {{work_dir}} and print sandboxes and/or other useful debugging info.
Also see the refactor in [MESOS-4634].
