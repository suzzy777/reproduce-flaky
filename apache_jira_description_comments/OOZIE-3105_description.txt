I'm able to reproduce the test failure consistently by running test in isolation with the following command
{code}
mvn clean -Dtest=org.apache.oozie.util.TestMetricsInstrumentation#testJMXInstrumentation test
{code}
the test succeeds consistently with the following
{code}
mvn clean -Dtest=org.apache.oozie.util.TestMetricsInstrumentation test
{code}
