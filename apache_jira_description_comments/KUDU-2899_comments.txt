Just another occurrence with a bit different manifestation:

{noformat}
/data/somelongdirectorytoavoidrpathissues/src/kudu/src/kudu/integration-tests/alter_table-randomized-test.cc:633: Failure
Failed
Bad status: Invalid argument: Some columns are not present in the current schema: c713
{noformat}

I'm attaching the log.

The Sentry integration is removed.
