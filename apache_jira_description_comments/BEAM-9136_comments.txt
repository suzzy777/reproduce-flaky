Is this complete?

Python part is complete. We can add Python to 2.21 and add Java to 2.22.

It's ok to cut release branch as it is in master for this ticket.

Okay, moving fix version to 2.22.

Update: we decided that the Java part should block 2.21.0 release after all.

I will keep this open until it is cherry-picked onto the release branch.
