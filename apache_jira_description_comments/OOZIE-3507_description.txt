Oozie uses [Dozer|http://dozer.sourceforge.net/] library. We use the [latest version|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.sf.dozer/dozer] (5.5.1) which was released in 2014.

The project has been revived, which should check the new 6.x version ( https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer ) and switch to it.
