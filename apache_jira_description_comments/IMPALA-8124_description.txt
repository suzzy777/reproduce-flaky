{noformat}

Hard to read, but apparently the test wants to perform two checks at once:

{noformat}
      assert response.status_code == requests.codes.ok\
          and string_to_search in response.text, "Offending url: " + input_url
{noformat}

The return code part appears to match. So the question is whether the string "total-file-size-bytes" appears in the output.

Tried building from latest master and hitting my local server with the same URL as above. The page reported:

{noformat}
num-partitions: 24
total-file-size-bytes: 489934
{noformat}

So, the string match part should work. 

General observation: it is not helpful at all to include an and in an {{assert}} statement: doing so makes debugging very difficult. Please use one condition per {{assert}}.

Net result is that there is no obvious failure here; someone will need to did into it more deeply.
