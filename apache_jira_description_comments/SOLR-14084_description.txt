FYI [~rcmuir] this is from a run where all the tests pass. 

Looking at the output in ./build/solr-core/test/tests-report.txt

{code:java}
# grep -F 'access denied' tests-report.txt | cut -d':' -f2 | sort | uniq -c

These didn't cause tests to fail but need to see why these are happening. I wouldn't expect we need most of these.
