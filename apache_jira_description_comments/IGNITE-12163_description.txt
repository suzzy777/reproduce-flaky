Steps to reproduce:
 * Create a cache with user-defined type

 * Add an ICacheEntryEventListener in order to be notified of CacheEntryEventType.Removed events

 * Put a value in the cache

 * Remove that value

Expected: CacheEntryEventType.Removed event get captured
Actual: CacheEntryEventType.Updated event get captured

Update:
After these changes https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-8714
New logic of detecting events (ContinuousQueryUtils.cs) now relies on the Object.Equals method which is not intuitive at all.
