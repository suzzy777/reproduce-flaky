These failures seem to be concurrency related, in particular there are races in the way that schema mutations are applied. What I believe is happening here is this: {{PasswordAuthenticator}} uses the presence of {{system_auth.credentials}} to indicate that the legacy credentials storage is still in place, as the data conversion performed on upgrade to 2.2 has not yet completed. Once all nodes are upgraded, it's the responsibility of an operator to drop the legacy tables, at which point {{PasswordAuthenticator}} switches to read the hashed password from {{system_auth.roles}} table. The race condition we seem to be hitting in these cases is that the {{credentials}} table is removed from the local schema datastructures after {{PasswordAuthenticator}} [tests for its existence|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.2.6/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/auth/PasswordAuthenticator.java#L82], but before the actual [read is performed|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.2.6/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/auth/PasswordAuthenticator.java#L143].

A simple solution is to have {{PasswordAuthenticator}} branch on the existence of {{system_auth.users}} rather than {{credentials}}, as both are migrated together and once a node is on 2.2+, it will never read the {{users}} table, as all user info is then read from {{roles}}. 

I've made that trivial change in [here|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra/commit/2445864c0ef8fc2a75d7ba10c6e6e76e0efad219] and [modified the dtest|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra-dtest/commit/4fa0813cfba3391f20045115d76e1cdf7379c0a0] so that it uses that as the upgrade target. Re-running the [multiplexed job|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized_dtest_multiplexer/125/parameters/] using that dtest branch shows no occurrences of this particular failure. There are a small number of other failures, which I can investigate though.

[~philipthompson], at first glance, it looks as though the failures are actually being doubly reported. Am I reading that correctly, that there are only 3 failures, not 6 as reported? 

You seem to have linked the build page for that job, not your specific run. However, jenkins will frequently "double report" errors yes. What's happening there, are that nosetests produces two xunit failure entrants for a given test, and cassci is simply bubbling that up to you. It's hard to tell without your results page, but I imagine for each test you are seeing one failure to start C*, and one failure to find the logs for the C* node that didn't start.

Ah, sorry the link to the results page is http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized_dtest_multiplexer/125/testReport/

Oh okay, yeah, that's just the dtest code double logging each error.

Most of the recent failures of this (on trunk) seem to be due to github being down:
http://cassci.datastax.com/job/trunk_dtest/1611/testReport/upgrade_internal_auth_test/TestAuthUpgrade/upgrade_to_22_test/

I have investigated this and believe this is no logger an issue.

After running dtest many times and I haven't come across the exceptions that were mentioned in the description. A patch similar to what [~beobal] described above was submitted in CASSANDRA-12813 and appears to have resolved the above failures.

However, I am getting the UnknownColumnFamilyException that's described in CASSANDRA-14049. As it's a separate issue that's tracked in it's own ticket, I think this issue can be closed.
