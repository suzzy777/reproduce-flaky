Pardon my impatience [~uagashe] (smile). I wanted to get something committed so the runs over night had something to chew on.... (2.001).

So, yeah, the timeout stuff on each test varied and did not align w/ general small/medium/large categorization... some were 60 seconds, some were 90seconds. I left it at medium size... should be enough I'd say... but now all tests get 180seconds to complete in. Lets see how it does. May have to make it Large anyways.

Leaving it open. Attributed the fix to you [~uagashe] since you did the work sir.

FAILURE: Integrated in Jenkins build HBase-Trunk_matrix #4536 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Trunk_matrix/4536/])
HBASE-19941 Flaky TestCreateTableProcedure times out in nightly, needs (stack: rev 3fa27c2382a70f692eb36d191228f9e796800ffb)

Thanks for the patch, [~stack]!

Resolving. Seems to have done the trick -- i.e. removing explict timeouts and instead relying on categorization.
