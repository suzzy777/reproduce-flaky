The RAT warning is something we must fix before commit. It means that you've created a new file and it does not have the ASF license header. Please copy a header over to SSLZookeeperFactory.

Otherwise the fix looks reasonable

I also like this change, the RAT warning can easily be solved.

The change also upgrades curator from 2.5.0 to 4.3.0, probably because we need a recent Zookeeper for this feature. Lots of Zookeeper excludes will force to use zookeeper 3.5.7 (personally I prefer using dependencyManagement to fix the a version instead of the excludes but it's not that important).

Can we just upgrade curator that easily? We were not brave enough to upgrade to 2.12 or 2.13 (see OOZIE-2231).
