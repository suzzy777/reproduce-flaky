This is a known flakyness and I think it would be solved when we can remove ZKUtils from Kafka tests. I've filed SPARK-28144 but Kafka feature is missing at the moment (better to say it's there but not working). Trying to push this area...

It would be better if we can reduce the chance of failures, as there're many tests in Kafka test suites which fail intermittently with this error. It would be better to do it immediately if increasing timeout would help, though I'm not sure more time was needed to propagate metadata or it was just stuck.

I've considered this possibility but after testing I've realized Kafka will never return such cases. You can have a deeper look and maybe you find what's the issue with Kafka. This area has definitely some enhancement possibilities like KAFKA-8468.
