Trying to import a note from a github repo lend to the following error
{code}
XMLHttpRequest cannot load xxxx/note.json. A wildcard '*' cannot be used in the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header when the credentials flag is true. Origin 'http://localhost:9000' is therefore not allowed access. The credentials mode of an XMLHttpRequest is controlled by the withCredentials attribute.
