There might be some issue with the patch. It might remove getFragment while adding the path to sharelib.
oozie.hive_conf=..../hive-site.xml#hive-site.xml will get added to map as hive-site.xml.





 Thank you for review [~puru]. I have updated the patch accordingly.
It was not possible to construct {{org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path}} out of "/some/dir/hive-site.xml#hive-site.xml" using {{org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.getFileStatus}} since the file {{hive-site.xml#hive-site.xml}} does not exist. I manually constructed the path.

[~satishsaley] can check the testcase failure? I don't remember seeing it failing before.

Looks like a flaky test. I am able to pass it locally. 

bq. Looks like a flaky test. I am able to pass it locally.
Ok, and it is not related to fix. 
Thanks for the patch, committed to trunk.

Amend-5:

We have two maps:
{code}
shareLibConfigMap<sharelibKey, <Path, Configuration>>
shareLibMap<sharelibKey,List<Path>>
{code}

The paths present in List<Path> are used to find configuration from {{shareLibConfigMap}}. It is obvious that values of Path should be the same in both to get the intended Configuration.

Currently, its not the case.

if in metafile we have
{code}
oozie.myhive=hdfs:///user/test/hive-site.xml#hive-site.xml
{code}
We populate map something like this -
{code}
shareLibConfigMap<"myhive", </user/test/hive-site.xml, config1>>
shareLibMap < "myhive", [hdfs://localhost:8020/user/test/hive-site.xml#hive-site.xml]
{code}

In JavaActionExecutor, we need to convert {{hdfs://localhost:8020/user/test/hive-site.xml#hive-site.xml }}to {{ /user/test/hive-site.xml }}for getting the correct configuration from {{shareLibConfigMap}}

Here is the code for it

https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/JavaActionExecutor.java#L682-L685

It works because {{hdfs://localhost:8020/user/test/hive-site.xml#hive-site.xml}} contains the fragment and we go to else part of the condition creating URI and getting Path part of it which is {{/user/test/hive-site.xml}}
{code}
new Path(new URI(
actionLibPath.toString()).getPath());
{code}

But in case if metafile is
{code}
oozie.myhive=/user/test/hive-site.xml
{code}
Then our maps :
{code}
shareLibConfigMap<"myhive", </user/test/hive-site.xml, config1>>
shareLibMap < "myhive", [hdfs://localhost:8020/user/test/hive-site.xml] 
{code}

In JavaActionExecutor, we won't go to the else part in the condition I showed. It simply refers to the {{hdfs://localhost:8020/user/test/hive-site.xml}} and does not get corresponding configuration in {{shareLibConfigMap}}

Earlier it used to work because, we were not putting hdfs paths in {{shareLibMap}}, we simply put the path mentioned in metafile.

I think we should be consistent with both the maps i.e. the Path we are putting in both should be the same and should not require any kind of logic for converting one Path for looking up into the other map to get corresponding Configuration.
