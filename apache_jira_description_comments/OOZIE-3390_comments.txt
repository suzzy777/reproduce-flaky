[~kmarton] I think {{ShellContentWriter}} should only print out the content of the script (if it's short enough) but it should not execute the script again. Instead you might use {{command -v}} (see: [https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2230] ) to find the absolute path of the command.

[~asalamon74] unfortunately, {{command -v}} isn't available on every tested platform, most notably, on GCE slaves' OSes that are used by {{dist_test}}. So we're stuck with using {{which}} that's indeed everywhere available.

[~kmarton] [~asalamon74] please review patch 003.

[~andras.piros] I think we can ignore the findbugs warning could you please add an annotation to suppress it?

I'd rather check the return value of {{waitFor}} and avoid calling exitValue (and a potential {{IllegalThreadStateException}}) if the return value is false.

[~asalamon74] thanks for the review!

Now checking also the return value of {{Process#waitFor(long, TimeUnit)}} to know whether the process is still running. If it is, returning {{false}}. If it has already been finished, returning {{exitValue}}. Also returning {{false}} in case of any and all {{IllegalThreadStateException}} instances happening during method calls.

Thanks for the fix [~andras.piros]

+1 (non binding), pending Jenkins.
