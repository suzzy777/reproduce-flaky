patch https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/compare/trunk...thelastpickle:mck/16781 

CI
 - 4.0.0 https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest-upgrade/388/
 - 4.0 https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest-upgrade/389/
 - trunk https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest-upgrade/390/

CI is looking good, +1 assuming it continues.

A number of dtests do {{'…  >= CASSANDRA_4_0 '}} comparisons.

I've updated the patch so the cassandra-4.0.0 branch is the {{CASSANDRA_4_0}} version family, and the cassandra-4.0 branch is the {{CASSANDRA_4_0_X}} version family, so that {{'CASSANDRA_4_0_X  >= CASSANDRA_4_0 '}}.

bq. upgrade_tests/upgrade_through_versions_test.py broke a test in trunk. working on it…

Looks to be a flaky, ignoring it for now.

Just checked and lgmt except for the fact the 4.0.0 CI run is unfortunately a 4.0 in fact. So +1 assuming a successful and correct 4.0.0 run.

4.0.0 needed another fix… (CI above updated)
