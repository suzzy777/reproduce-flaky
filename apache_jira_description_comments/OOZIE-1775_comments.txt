Thanks for taking this up. It is really annoying to have that failure everytime. 

-1 the patch contains 1 line(s) with trailing spaces
-1 TESTS
   - The same test is still failing. Can you take a look?

test was failing because of less time accounted for event generation by command. fixed. Ran whole suit twice and these otherwise failing tests did not fail. 
{code}
org.apache.oozie.event.TestEventGeneration.testCoordinatorActionEvent
org.apache.oozie.sla.TestSLAEventGeneration
{code}

Some other tests are observed to sporadically fail in pre-commit builds but no set pattern like these two above.

above test failure unrelated and not in this scope. please review and I will commit with fixing the trailing tabs and >132 char

+1,  as long as + waitForEventGeneration(500), 500 is long enough to succeed test case consistently (minor point)

patch v3 attached. ryota's comment addressed. kept wait interval till 1 sec (instead of 500ms) to account for slower machines. Repeatedly running entire test suite the test passes each time.
also fixed trailing tabs

updated patch to fix failing test from previous pre-commit build, by editing the coordinator xml to materialize only one action.
{code}
TestSLAEventGeneration.testCoordActionSubmitAndStart
{code}

Other failures are flaky tests and unrelated to this JIRA. I've checked again by running whole test suite and do not see consistent failures.

Looks like something funny happened during Jenkins' run, it was only 10min.  I've just kicked off another run.

[~chitnis], those other test failures are unrelated, right?

yes unrelated. Thanks for review. Committed to trunk!

TestSLAEventGeneration.testCoordinatorActionCommandsSubmitAndStart is still flaky and should be fixed

All flaky tests will be fixes as part of OOZIE-1811
