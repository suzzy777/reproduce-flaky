The follow four properties can be added:

ssl.keyStore.passwordPath
ssl.quorum.keyStore.passwordPath
ssl.trustStore.passwordPath
ssl.quorum.trustStore.passwordPath

Specifies the file path that contains the key/trust store password. Reading the password from a file takes precedence over the explicit password property.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts on this. I can submit a PR for it.
