If the table has been manually refreshed, all its events happen before the manual REFRESH can be skipped.
Â 
This happens when catalogd is lagging behind in processing events. When processing an event, we can check whether there are manual REFRESH executed after its eventTime. In such case, we don't need to process the event to refresh anything. This helps catalogd to catch up HMS events quickly.
