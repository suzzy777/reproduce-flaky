Are you using a session between multiple threads?

Each thread should have its own session.

for such an error, that's the only plausible reason. you're using the same session between multiple threads... one thread issues a command, same a createQueue, and on another thread you issue another command, say a createSesssion();

We could synchronize until a return statement is done, however that would have performance implications.. hence the right thing to do is to use a session per thread.

Thank you for the tip! I will investigate. 

I was not the original author of the client interaction code but after investigating I found that the JMS session was definitely shared between threads. I synchronized access to the shared session and the error disappeared. Thanks for your helpful input!
