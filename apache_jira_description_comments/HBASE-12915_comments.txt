TestHCM fails in trunk currently.

I ran TestMasterObserver locally with patch and it passed.

Small scanning does not make any sense with batching anyway, since batching is needed for large single rows that we do not want to bring back in a single RPC. Re-seeking multiple times with the ClientSmallScanner is inefficient in this case.

+1 to disabling the combination.

Do you want an exception, or just quietly fall back to the normal scanner?


I prefer an exception.

Fine with me. +1

bq. This test fails in trunk consistently.

Since which commit?  Looking at trunk, it fails rare.  It is reliable fail now?

Looks like I should have checked more builds before making judgment.

TestHCM failed in trunk build #6055. It also failed in some QA runs.

What I wanted to say is that the patch is not related to TestHCM flakiness.
