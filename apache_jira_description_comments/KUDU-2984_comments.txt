[~acelyc111] could you take a look?

I'll take a look.

Assigning to [~acelyc111] who is going to take a closer look.  Thanks [~acelyc111]!

I found 2 problems may make this test flaky:
 # Test table has only 1 tablet (by default) and 1 replica, so data writes on only 1 tserver, the other 2 may not conssume much memory when we do scan workload.
 # For tserver-1, scan workload is going on together with interval memory GC, in a corner case, GC may always take place after CHECK, so CHECK always failed.

I'm sorry that this test is still flaky after 2 fix patches:(, now I try to fix again [https://gerrit.cloudera.org/c/14553/,|https://gerrit.cloudera.org/c/14553/] and repeated test for thousands times on Ubuntu 18.04 and all passed. However, I'll do more test before I try to merge it.

Has been fixed by [https://gerrit.cloudera.org/c/14553/].
