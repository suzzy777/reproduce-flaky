I've added the missing job to the template & regenerated the low, mid and high resource files. I've also copied {{config.yml.LOWRES}} to {{config.yml}}, which I should've done in CASSANDRA-16474. 

[patch|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...beobal:16489-trunk?expand=1]

Thanks [~samt], I made a pass and I have only one question, we don't have to patch utests_system_keyspace_directory for higher resources, they are fine with medium resources? I mean for LOWRES and MIIDRES probably we are good as that is how the tests were added initially. But I wasn't sure whether you guys want them on HIGHRES on your end?

Maybe it is a good idea to trigger one clean run?

I ended up running CI as I was trying to fix one more issue which we thought it is a matter of line but it turned out it is not so I am going to open a new ticket for that one.

 CI runs look similar to Jenkins:
MIDRES - [JAVA8 | https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/668/workflows/fdc790c1-86ed-4132-9bd7-8f514e7d9574] | [JAVA11 | https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/667/workflows/ace464c4-41eb-4ca5-8814-508e130a88b1]
HIGHRES - [JAVA8 | https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/668/workflows/fdc790c1-86ed-4132-9bd7-8f514e7d9574] | [JAVA11 |https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/668/workflows/6f361605-0da3-40e3-ba49-fd9eb0c6d324 ]

I was thinking to commit the patch tonight but there is one thing I just saw.

_utest_system_keyspace_directory_ turns out to need approval to be started not only by _utest_system_keyspace_directory_ but also by _utests_fqltool_

For reference, please, check the line connections in the diagram from the  [JAVA8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/668/workflows/fdc790c1-86ed-4132-9bd7-8f514e7d957] CI run

I know this was set during the initial addition of the tests but I think it is wrong, we should be able to start them as unit tests in their own group. I don't think those have anything in common with the FQLtool. (CC [~blerer] as an author to correct me in case I am wrong :))

Sorry, that's a bad copy pasta from me. I've pushed fixed versions and I'll run through CI now.

Added a fix for CASSANDRA-16498 to the [branch|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...beobal:16489-trunk?expand=1] and re-ran Circle jobs. 

[JDK 8 |https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/beobal/cassandra/250/workflows/38d3199f-bc21-48da-97f6-479ca24d8dad] and [JDK 11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/beobal/cassandra/250/workflows/1962796c-ac14-4854-89d9-2c12a4830c27] both look good. Except for known failures from CASSANDRA-16483 & one flaky repair test, all python tests are now passing. 

LGTM, thank you!

Thanks, committed to trunk in {{9943d4b3035c2c69cd28001254b743b5c494ab01}}
