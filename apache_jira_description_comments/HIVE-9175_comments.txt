In addition to implementing onAlterTable and onAlterPartition to the NotificationListener this patch also changes the AlterPartitionEvent so that it includes the table that contains the partition.  This allows the JSON message code to determine the topic name to publish the message on.

I don't believe the TestStreaming failure is related, as it passes locally and I didn't change any code in this area.  I thought I fixed the flakiness in that test but I guess not.

Your comment on alter-table needing to come on the table topic and not the db topic is a bit troubling, I'll probably have to revisit that after implementing ReplicationTasks on top of this to verify, since it really should be coming on the table topic. But for now, let's get this in.

Committed. Thanks, Alan!

Doc note:  This should be documented (with version information) in the introduction to the Notification doc, which currently says

The current version of HCatalog supports two kinds of events:
*  Notification when a new partition is added
*  Notification when a set of partitions is added
