This test is not executed in Circle CI nor in Jenkins because it does not end on "Test". This was observed while building patches for CASSANDRA-17964.

pinging [~ifesdjeen] as he is author of that test.

This [doesn't occur on 4.1|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/695/workflows/c9cc5828-a5ad-4730-ae8a-28a7c369ba2a/jobs/7601/tests], but there was a problem copying the results:

{noformat}
mv: cannot move 'build/test/logs//org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.ReprepareOldBehaviourTest' to '/tmp/results/repeated_utests/logs/passes/1/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.ReprepareOldBehaviourTest': File exists

Exited with code exit status 1
{noformat}

I'm not sure what's going on there, but the test does pass so I don't think we need to block rc.

I hit it in 3.11 (as mentioned in description). Thanks for verifying for 4.1. Not sure what the problem is with renaming. I will double check this upon building CASSANDRA-17964 for 4.1 branch in Circle.

If not reproducible for 4.1, that is one problem less but I think it needs to be still addressed for 3.11, even not so important right now.

Just to add some more observations on 3.11 failures with this test - I've seen this quite a few times when testing on 3.11 (in Circle), the latest is at [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/JeetKunDoug/cassandra/68/workflows/74205a42-1f5b-4813-9492-d71b0879675a/jobs/1734/tests#failed-test-0]

but almost every one of the in-jvm test runs have hit this, so it's not so flakey as "almost always failing" for me on 3.11.

Just hit this again, this time in 3.11
