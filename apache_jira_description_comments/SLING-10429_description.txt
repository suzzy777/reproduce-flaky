With the switch to using {{bnd.bnd}} in 4.2.18, the sling.event bundle no longer contained the sling.event.api bundle. Downstream javadoc generation failed to locate source files for the embedded sling.event.api classes however. One way to fix this, that I'm aware of, is to include the sling.event.api bundle in the jar again. (Another variant might be to embed source files of the event-api.jar in event.jar..)
