pushed up a couple of nits (unused import/unrelated whitespace) and a test improvement Caleb made to fix some test flakiness.

+1 with the test change included (nits are just that... nits).

Thanks for the review [~jmeredithco] - I spaced on this one and it's a 4.0.x dupe version of what Caleb did on trunk (that, ironically and slightly horrifically,Â _I reviewed_ a month ago) on CASSANDRA-16775. I kept trying to figure out why it felt so familiar...

I'm going to blame this on the time dilation effect of 2020/2021 and close as dupe, though I will pursue us getting the RepairErrorsTest into the 4.0.x line. No harm in having more testing in the patch line.
