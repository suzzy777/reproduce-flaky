[~1ambda] actually i've tried locally with exactly same commands and tests were passing. I wonder whether you have this failures when running only say GitNotebookRepoTest class

It also passes on my machine. This means that it's flaky, I will add the label.
It also means it either depends on timing, or some local state (conf on HDD). 

[~1ambda] can you please try what [~khalidhnv] suggested and run tests individually on the clean clone and report back? Also, is that Scala 2.11 specific or is reproducible on 2.10 as well?


There is one more test on Zengine failing on [CI|https://api.travis-ci.org/jobs/180159816/log.txt?deansi=true] under [#1682|https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1682]

Do you guys think it should be included here?

    Looks great to me, thank you @felixcheung let's merge if there is no further discussion!
    
    CI failure of tests in `zeppelin-zengine` on 1 profile looks not relevant and will be taken care under [ZEPPELIN-1737](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1737)

Thanks for sharing [~khalidhnv] Could you also share your env? (java, scala, os versions) so that we can collect information about this problem.

[~1ambda] I'm quite sure that's because one of git operations in those tests fail. my environment:
javac 1.8.0_112-ea
git version 2.9.1
scala version 2.10.6
OS X 10.11.5 

[~khalidhnv] You are right. 

The tests are failed when i run `GitNotebookRepoTest` only in IDEA (I attached a screenshot)

I think i can debug this bugs in IDEA. Let me share the result :)

[~bzz] 

Also failed in Scala 2.10.6 env.  (same errors)

I have a question. If we use Scala 2.10.x with the command {{./dev/change_scala_version.sh 2.11}}, is it valid build? 

I think build would be valid, but at runtime there would be version collision error

Log for the error.

It turns out that current GitNotebookTest doesn't work on git 2.10+
since Git doens’t allow empty commit without `—allow-empty` since git 2.10

Ref - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.11.0.txt


That's a good one, i'll look into that. thanks for reporting!

Actually I've checked it even with git 2.11.0 and couldn't reproduce. Here's some facts: 
 - that `--allow-empty` fix comes from 2.11.0 not 2.10, more info [here|https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation/RelNotes]
 - in your original report you have 2.10.2 version of git, not 2.11.0 so that shouldn't have been the case
So possibly that's not the reason or needs more digging

That's true! I was using 2.10.x when i reported this first time. 

It turns out that globally ignored note.json cause this result. :(
