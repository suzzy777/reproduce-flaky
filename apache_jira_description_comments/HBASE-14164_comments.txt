Hi, Ted

How do I navigate to the screen shot from my master-status UI page?

From master UI, you can click on any table.
If the table has REGION_REPLICATION greater than 1, you would see the new column.

Got it. 
Helpful improvement.

TestWALProcedureStoreOnHDFS has been flaky for a while.

Change to UI is not related to snapshot test failure.
