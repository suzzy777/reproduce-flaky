Etienne, do you think you could take a look at this or help triage to someone with the context?

Valentyn, spark validates runner tests do not use any cluster. They use local in JVM runner and  TestSparkRunner beam class. So I bet, this IO problem is more a jenkins configuration issue. Strange that we cannot create a directory in /tmp. [~jbonofre] can you please check with apache infra team or check it yourself if you have the rights? Thanks

[~apilloud] Several tests that fail to write to /tmp on jenkins. Definitely a jenkins issue IMHO.
