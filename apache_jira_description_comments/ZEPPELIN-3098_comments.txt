    [ZEPPELIN-3098] Livy Interpreter fails if row contains newline or tab

    ### What is this PR for?
    This PR fixes the issue of newlines and tabs breaking results in the SQL interpreter in Livy.
    
    The Livy interpreter will return incorrect results if a row contains \n or \t characters.
    In the case of the newline, the result will be:
    Line is missing from results if the \n appears anywhere but the end of a cell
    `String index out of range: 17` if it appears at the end of a cell
    In the case of the tab, the result will be misaligned columns if the tab appears in the middle of a cell
    The output showing these error is attached.
    
    I have changed the parsing and any newline or tab characters will be escaped
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    Bug Fix 
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?

    @bushnoh thanks for the contribution, could you check the CI, some tests fails.

    @zjffdu The CI errors look unrelated. They're for the IPythonInterpreter and are the same ones that are failing on master.

    @bushnoh I have fixed the CI failure, could you rebase this PR and retrigger the travis build ?

    @zjffdu I have merged in the changed from master however there are still CI failures. They are again both unrelated and are the ones that are happening on master: https://travis-ci.org/apache/zeppelin/builds/315822086

    @bushnoh https://travis-ci.org/apache/zeppelin/builds/315822086 This build doesn't include your PR, and some flaky test is known issue of zeppelin, but IPython related failure should be fixed.

    @zjffdu I was trying to show that the tests failing in master (that don't include my changes) are the same ones with the same errors that are failing on my branch with the changes

    I think test passed? it's too long and jenkins no longer has the build
    @zjffdu

    @zjffdu @felixcheung I merged changes from master into the branch to trigger another build however it looks like master is failing in Jenkins again. The previous build did pass though.

    @bushnoh Travis build issue has been fixed, could you retrigger the build of this PR ?
