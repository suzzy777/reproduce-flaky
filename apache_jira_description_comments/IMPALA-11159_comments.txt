[~sql_forever] I assigned this Jira to you because you added that test to Impala. Please feel free to reassign/unassign if you think it belongs to someone else.

This test reaches the specified timeout which makes it fail. However, this exception happens because the Impyla query handler HiveServer2Cursor does not have an 'id' field, which would be used to print throw an error.

Commit 15a5bfd5f618420645c4d3d1d38a54c9a286beaf in impala's branch refs/heads/master from Tamas Mate

IMPALA-11159: Fix AttributeError in TestAsyncDDLTiming.test_ctas

TestAsyncDDLTiming.test_ctas is likely to be flaky, additionally it
throws AttributeError when fails which hides the details of the failure.
This commit fixes the AttributeError which is caused by the Impyla tests,
the Impyla handler is a HiveServer2Cursor object that does not have an
'id' attribute. Query string can be printed instead of the query id.

Testing:
 - Triggered test failure manually and verified the result.

I'm going to close this as resolved for the patch, and open a new ticket for occasionally slow CTAS in S3 and Ozone.
