this patch respect 'pig.temp.dir' first in case we want to put temp file in other location. Otherwise set location as System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/build/test/tmp/". 

It uses the FileLocalizer to get temp dir from PigContext, and then replace all /tmp in the test code.

I verify it and TestMultiQueryLocal passes for me.

Hi [~dreambird], thanks for working on this. I have a comment:

{code}
String tdir = System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/build/test/tmp/";
{code}
user.dir would not be required here. Setting tdir to "build/test/tmp" should work.




To get the path without the scheme, you can do:
{code}
FileLocalizer.getTemporaryPath(myPig.getPigContext()).toUri().getPath()
{code}
instead of
{code}
if (TMP_DIR.startsWith("file:/")) {
   TMP_DIR = TMP_DIR.substring(5, TMP_DIR.length());
}
{code}

Hi, [~prkommireddi] and [~cheolsoo], thanks a lot for checking the code. I just post the new patch to resolve your comments.

+1. I will commit it.

Committed to trunk. Thanks Johnny!
