CASSANDRA-15556 and related tickets showed that LZ4FastDecompressor can crash the JVM and that LZ4SafeDecompressor performs better w/o the crash risk — its also not deprecated. While we protect ourselves by checksumming the compressed data but that doesn’t mean we should leave deprecated code that can segfault the jvm (providing a potential DDOS vector among other things) in crucial places like io.compress.
