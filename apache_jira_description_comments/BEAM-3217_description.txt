We should add a large scale performance test for HadoopInputFormatIO. We should use PerfKitBenchmarker based performance testing framework [1] to manage Kubernetes based muti-node data store and to publish benchmark results.

Example input format implementation to use: DBInputFormat to connect to a Postgres instance.
https://github.com/hanborq/hadoop/blob/master/src/mapred/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/db/DBInputFormat.java
 
Example docker image to use: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/
