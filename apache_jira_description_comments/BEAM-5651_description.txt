Initial investigation:

Maven failed to download the 2.8.0-SNAPSHOT artifact for beam-model-fn-execution. However, I can see that snapshot binaries exist: https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/beam/beam-model-fn-execution/2.8.0-SNAPSHOT/

{{[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project word-count-beam: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.example:word-count-beam:jar:0.1: Could not find artifact org.apache.beam:beam-model-fn-execution:jar:2.8.0-SNAPSHOT in test.release (https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots) -> [Help 1]}}
