With the fix of OOZIE-2726 a small functionality change is included for the following scenario:
 * between the start and end date there is one DST change
 * the nominal time of the last action should be maximum 1h before the end time.
 * this last action will not be created after the OOZIE-2726, because of the DST correction, the nominal time will exceed the end time. 

The documentation says:
{quote}
...the Oozie processing timezone is used to resolve coordinator jobs start/*end times* ...

I think that we should not include functionality changes with test fixtures, so I would remove the DST correction from the end time: [*{{CoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand#materializeActions()}}*|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/command/coord/CoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand.java#L440].
