Eugene, since you know more about how SDF is represented, perhaps you could follow my model and convert SDF to also use the portable style?

What's the state of this one ? Thanks !

Sorry, it got 2.3.0 because it was a clone of a resolved issue. Not urgent or blocking.

Specifically: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/runners/google-cloud-dataflow-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/dataflow/DataflowPipelineTranslator.java#L963
