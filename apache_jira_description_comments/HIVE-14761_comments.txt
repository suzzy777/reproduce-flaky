Discussed a bit with [~jdere] on the tests in this class (for perm function and temp tables). I think we can do away with this class by moving the tests to TestJdbcWithMiniHS2. I'll move forward with that.

I'll move those 2 tests as part of another patch for HIVE-14721. Just removing the whole class in this one.

[~sseth] Up for review whenever you get a chance.

Failures unrelated. [~sseth] can you take a look?

+1.

Created HIVE-14936 to track the flaky minillap test.

Committed to master. Thanks [~sseth].
