    [ZEPPELIN-1837] Fix possible reason of DepInterpreterTest failure

    ### What is this PR for?
    Fix possible reason of DepInterpreterTest failure
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    [Bug Fix]
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    [ZEPPELIN-1837](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1837)
    
    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update? No
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? No
    * Does this needs documentation? No
    
    DepInterpreterTest will use random temporary folder for repo
    
    `DefaultRepositorySystem.resolveDependencies` throws NPE at line 352
    if `ArtifactResolutionException` is thrown during `collectDependencies`.
    Artifact is found but it is impossible to download it (for example folder
    can't be created)
    
    I think the reason is that several tests use "local-repo" folder for repository.
    While one test tries to download artifact, another deletes repository
    (or some another distructive thing)

    Thanks for fixing a flaky test :) 
    
    It would be great if you accumulate CI multiple results like #1667 for review. Just closing and re-opening will also works instead of pushing the ammended commit multiple times

    @bzz @1ambda I attached CI logs
    
    Failures are:
    * `ZeppelinIT.testAngularDisplay:157->AbstractZeppelinIT.waitForText:84 » StaleElementReference`
    * `AngularElemTest:`
      `AngularElem`
      - `should provide onclick method *** FAILED ***`
        `The code passed to eventually never returned normally. Attempted 1 times over 359.286866 milliseconds. Last failure message: 0 was not equal to 1. (AbstractAngularElemTest.scala:64)`
    * `RemoteSchedulerTest.test:150 expected:<0> but was:<1>`
    * `InterpreterIT.testShowDescriptionOnInterpreterCreate:69 » ElementNotVisible Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with`
    * `AngularElemTest:`
      `AngularElem`
      - `should provide onclick method *** FAILED ***`
        `The code passed to eventually never returned normally. Attempted 1 times over 198.575701 milliseconds. Last failure message: 0 was not equal to 1. (AbstractAngularElemTest.scala:64)`
    
    Seems to be unrelated to dependency resolution

    Those are other flaky tests already reported. You can search JIRA [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ZEPPELIN%20and%20text%20~%20%22testShowDescriptionOnInterpreterCreate%22)
    
    Thanks for triggering CI multiple times. 
    Regarding to your question, i am also not sure. But if i were a travis CI developer, i wouldn't create new CI build if there is already connected, running one. (it's just my guess)
