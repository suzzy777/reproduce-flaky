HIVE-20420(CVE-2018-11777) introduced a fallback authorizer factory which disallowed some builtin UDFs such as java_method, reflect, reflect2 and in_file. But Sentry does not black in_file up to now, so a malicious user can use in_file in SQL queries to detect some specific files on the HS2 host, or to detect whether a specific file has specific content. in_file should be added to HIVE_UDF_BLACK_LIST.
