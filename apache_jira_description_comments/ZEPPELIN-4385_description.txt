Currently, when a new pull request is created,

 

 1. Individual contributor's travis integration build branch

 2. Jenkins (managed by ASF infra) triggered and check individual contributor's travis build status

 3. Pull request build status is displayed based on Jenkins's check result

 

There was two reasons why Zeppelin project uses Jenkins + Individual contributor's travis integration.

 * Travis build slots in ASF organization is limited and couldn't get enough slot to build pullrequest and often PR waits more than 12h to be scheduled

 * Restarting individual flaky tests is not possible. while individual contributor doesn't have permission to access ASF's travis integration. Therefore, Flaky test fail require full test matrix restart and that was quite painful. While full test matrix run again produce other flaky test fails.

 

 

However, Jenkins now only triggered by pullrequest from comitters. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-19249

 

Lack of integration test on pull requests really make collative development difficult, in the community.

 

Recently, Github added CI functionality through [Github Actions.|https://github.com/features/actions]

I think we need to consider this. Reasons are

 

 - Can build all pull requests

 - Non shared build slots (Build slot is not shared with other ASF project, unlike Travis)

 - Individual contributor also able to run CI build their branch before making PR
