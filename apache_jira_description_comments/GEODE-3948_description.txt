Client CQ connections occasionally stop receiving messages and become blocked indefinitely. 

This can be caused by a server that hangs or dies without sending a close message, or by some firewalls. 

The client already gets ping messages from the server, but currently ignores them. Let's use those messages to detect a failed connection and close it.

Probably the client should follow the same logic and send ping messages if it has sent no acks for a while, so that the server can also detect and close a broken connection.

The timeout could be specified as a number and time interval, the ping interval and the number of missed pings after which to fail.
