I have tried to follow the [installation guide|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/tree/master/zookeeper-client/zookeeper-client-c], but cannot understand how to make the *autoreconf* step to work. It is failing at the AM_PATH_CPPUNIT missing. Have tried the suggestions in the guide, but without success.Â 

The OS I have used are Mac OS X and Elementary OS. Also, went trying using CentOS in a docker container, but cannot figure out how to add all requirements (autoconf missing etc).

Previous builds of the Zookeeper C Client (3.5.x) have worked fine though, I guess something has changed?

For the development of node-zookeeper, this is a blocker.

Do you have any suggestions how to solve this?
