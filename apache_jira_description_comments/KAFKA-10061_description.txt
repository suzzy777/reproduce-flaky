We have seen this a few times:
{code}
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: Timed out waiting for verifyAssignment result VerifyAssignmentResult(Map(foo-0 -> PartitionReassignmentState(List(0, 1, 3, 2),List(0, 1, 3),false), baz-1 -> PartitionReassignmentState(List(0, 2, 3, 1),List(0, 2, 3),false)),true,Map(),false).  The latest result was VerifyAssignmentResult(Map(foo-0 -> PartitionReassignmentState(ArrayBuffer(0, 1, 3),List(0, 1, 3),true), baz-1 -> PartitionReassignmentState(ArrayBuffer(0, 2, 3),List(0, 2, 3),true)),false,HashMap(),false)
{code}

It looks like the reassignment is completing earlier than the test expects. See the following from the log:

{code}
Successfully started partition reassignments for baz-1,foo-0
==> verifyAssignment(adminClient, jsonString={"version":1,"partitions":[{"topic":"foo","partition":0,"replicas":[0,1,3],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"baz","partition":1,"replicas":[0,2,3],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]}]})
Status of partition reassignment:
Reassignment of partition baz-1 is still in progress.
Reassignment of partition foo-0 is complete.
{code}

A successful run looks like this:
{code}
Successfully started partition reassignments for baz-1,foo-0
==> verifyAssignment(adminClient, jsonString={"version":1,"partitions":[{"topic":"foo","partition":0,"replicas":[0,1,3],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"baz","partition":1,"replicas":[0,2,3],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]}]})
Status of partition reassignment:
Reassignment of partition baz-1 is still in progress.
Reassignment of partition foo-0 is still in progress.
