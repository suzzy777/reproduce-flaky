Let me take a look but I think it's already fixed.

Can you confirm it is already fixed? I will unassign so that anyone can come along and try to confirm.

Leaving version as Not Applicable because it is a test flake and not user facing and it isn't worth the time to sort out when it was merged.

The test was disabled but it has not been fixed yet.

Should disabled tests be P1? For a connector with so little maintenance, I don't think it makes sense. I will replace the tag from "flake" to "sickbay".

This issue is P2 but has been unassigned without any comment for 60 days so it has been labeled "stale-P2". If this issue is still affecting you, we care! Please comment and remove the label. Otherwise, in 14 days the issue will be moved to P3.

Please see https://beam.apache.org/contribute/jira-priorities/ for a detailed explanation of what these priorities mean.
