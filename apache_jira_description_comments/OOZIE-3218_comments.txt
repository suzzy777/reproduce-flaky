Thanks for the contribution [~mbalakrishnan]!

Can you please:
* use {{camelCase}} for local variables, e.g. {{queryStr}}
* use a {{StringBuilder}} instead of {{String}} concatenation
* extend {{TestSqoopActionExecutor}} to cover the case you're addressing

Thanks for the new patch [~mbalakrishnan]! Can you please upload patch002 to ReviewBoard to continue discussion there? Thanks!

[~mbalakrishnan], [~andras.piros] Patch002 is on review board https://reviews.apache.org/r/67314/ and has been modified to cleanly apply on master branch.

[~dionusos] reviewed. Till the glorious moment :) when we'll begin to use GitHub pull requests both for reviews and pre-commit hook, can you please upload both to ReviewBoard (review) and JIRA issue (pre-commit hook)? Thanks!

This looks like a duplicate of OOZIE-2949. I don't really mind which one is committed as far as it fixes the issue.

Thanks for the contribution [~mbalakrishnan], I have left some comments on the reviewBorad, please fix them.

[~mbalakrishnan] [~asalamon74] whoever is working on either issues OOZIE-3218 and OOZIE-2949 please make sure both issues are handled by a single patch. The other issue can be closed as duplicate.

It seems to me both JIRAs address the same problem, but provide a different solution. If sqoop command contains the query string like this: {{--query select * from abc}} Oozie incorrectly splits it into multiple parts instead of two tokens "--query" and "select * from abc".

OOZIE-3218 suggests to recognize {{--query}} as a tokenstarter and will keep the next arguments as a single token till the next token starter (e.g. --username). OOZIE-2949 suggests to use single or double quotes to denote the tokens and use {{--query 'select * from abc'}} so it will be easier to recognize {{select * from abc}} as a single token.

We have to choose which approach is better and implement that one and close the other Jira as duplicate.

I think OOZIE-2949 gives a better solution, we should require the usage of single or double quotes. Without the quotes bash treats * as a wildcard, hence Sqoop itself suggest to use single quotes in the command line: [https://sqoop.apache.org/docs/1.4.3/SqoopUserGuide.html#_free_form_query_imports]

Allow the users to copy a working sqoop command line to Oozie XML would be the most convenient for the users.

[~mbalakrishnan] [~dionusos] [~gezapeti] [~andras.piros] What are your opinions?

+1 for the quote usage. With this approach we can be in sync with the Sqoop command line as well.

I prefer to handle the quotes. In my opinion using quotes in linux environment is a common when I need to write whitespaces. Also the implementation could be more maintainable due to we do not have to watch newly created options/token borders.

Thanks [~kmarton], [~dionusos]. Closing this issue as duplicate, and continue the development on OOZIE-2949 .
