Cannot repro, suggesting to close until it can be repro'ed

Locally I failed it also in java 8. Also, I checked it with older trunk versions from April and it was failing. 
So I wouldn't close it. The thing is that it was not failing up until recently neither in Jenkins, nor in CircleCI (but probably no one had the need to run it locally :-( ). Now It fails in CircleCI. So whatever is the issue, it got bigger. I will try to look at it more next week

Thx for the feedback [~e.dimitrova] . I am assigning it to you bc I can't repro locally :(

Thank you for your time and work [~Bereng], I know how frustrating this could be but not being able to reproduce easily test failures happens sometimes. 

I am already looking into it, I am moving the ticket back to work in progress. Thank you one more time!

This test was put in a loop to be run 10 times. This was done in order to be able to catch an issue which was hard to be reproduced. The loop had the goal to help us to ensure that the applied patch is enough to fix the problem. This was done 5 years ago as part of CASSANDRA-9460 . I put some additional logging and I observed that the test fails during its 9th repetition as the test run duration becomes more than the time threshold of 900s.

Jenkins shows the test is stable so I removed the loop. Just looped it 10 times locally successfully. I believe this is enough to solve the problem. Attached log of the local run

[~Bereng], [~blerer], can anyone of you review the solution, please?

Thanks in advance!

[~e.dimitrova] I went over the original ticket and it seems there is already a consistency test checking for the NULL. Despite that the original authors considered looping a good idea still to surface any races hiding in there. Instead of removing the looping completely could we just reduce it to 5 loops i.e.? wdyt?

[~Bereng], I can make it 5 but I think it is a left-over from 5 years ago. The thing is the author wasn't able to reproduce it and she left the loop to ensure the community can faster see any regressions in case this needs additional fix. 5 years later I don't find neither a ticket, nor an evidence in any CI that the issue reappeared so to me it looks like just an unneeded leftover. Let me know if you still want the 5 times loop. It doesn't hurt to have It but I don't see a reason anymore, honestly.

Kill it then. It will come up eventually if it has to and git history will be there. +1 from me.

[~brandon.williams] do you mind to commit if you don't see any issue, please?

Committed.
