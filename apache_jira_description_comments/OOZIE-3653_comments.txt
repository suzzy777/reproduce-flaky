I agree with [~pj.fanning] if it's compatible we should upgrade to commons-io 2.11.0. [~groot] can you please upload a new patch. Thanks.

Thanks [~asalamon74] and [~pj.fanning] for your suggestion. I can see that 2.8.0 is used in hadoop 3 as part of this Jira Â [HADOOP-17683|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-17683]. So I upgraded to 2.8.0 to avoid potential classpath conflicts. Do you think we upgrade to commons-io 2.11.0?

[~groot] I agree with [~asalamon74] to use commons-io 2.11.0. Please upload a patch with 2.11.0 to check compatibility.

Thanks [~dionusos] for your comment. I have attached patch OOZIE-3653-002.patch with commons-io upgraded to 2.11.0
