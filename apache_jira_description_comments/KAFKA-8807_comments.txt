Ran the test locally 100 times and could not reproduce the issue.Â  Also, this is the only known report of this test failing.

Reopening this as I am going to refactor the test to check that close is only called once during shutdown.

   A minor refactor to explicitly verify that `Processor#close` is only called once.
