The flaky test is because we want to verify the LEO is exactly the number we expected. But because we default deliver semantics is "at least once", which means, the LEO might be greater or equal to the expected number. This issue can be fixed after KAFKA-13598 is merged. That is, default producer will be idempotence producer by default. 

[~showuon] Can we close this?

Close this ticket since  KAFKA-13598 is merged. Thanks.
