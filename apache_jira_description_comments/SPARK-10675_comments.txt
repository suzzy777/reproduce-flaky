Is this still a problem?

This test looks pretty good (https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/Spark-1.5-SBT/AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE=hadoop2.2,label=spark-test/357/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.sql.hive/HiveSparkSubmitSuite/SPARK_8020__set_sql_conf_in_spark_conf/history/). I am going to resolve it.
