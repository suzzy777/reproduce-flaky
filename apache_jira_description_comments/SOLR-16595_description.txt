COming out of another ticket:

TimeUnit class was introduced in part to add clarity to call-sites of a method so the unit is clear. blah.setTime(TimeUnit.SECOND, 1) is fine as well as blah.setTime(TimeUnit.MINUTE,2) -- the caller picks the unit convenient to them. With that design, the method is designed unit-free -- definitely NOT with variables named "second" as you proposed since the unit could be anything. Internally (implementation of the setter), we need to pick a unit to standardize to on some internal field to store the result, and name the field to be clear as to what the internal unit chosen is. (e.g. retryExpirySecs). Again, that's internal, the caller choses a unit convenient to them.
