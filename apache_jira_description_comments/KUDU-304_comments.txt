http://gerrit.sjc.cloudera.com:8080/#/c/7097/ has the actual implementation of this. We need to add test coverage for replicated alter table, though.

It appears that this sorta-kidna works as is. However, it ends up spewing warnings because the master tries to send the AlterSchema RPC to every replica, not just the leader. The non-leaders keep responding with errors, so the master spews logs while it retries forever.

We should change the master so that the "task" here is associated with a tablet, not a replica, and on each retry it always sends the RPC to the current LEADER at that time.

This is a master side change to make it send Alter commands to the leader. Todd started working on this, hoping to have up for review by EOD 7/29.

Above-mentioned changes are implemented here:

This slipped last week because of a new complication which popped up: KUDU-915.

Considering committing this early this week anyway with the stress test marked DISABLED, since the patch itself is an improvement over what we have today. It's just that it adds additional coverage which exposes KUDU-915.

Found a workaround for KUDU-915, and this is committed now.

We have a bit of flakiness on the tests, but will work through them under separate JIRAs.
