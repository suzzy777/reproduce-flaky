According to the source code DynamicBrokerReconfigurationTest.testUncleanLeaderElectionEnable(), the test will fail with the exception above if leader election is not completed within 15 seconds. Thus the test may fail if there is long GC. We can reduce the chance of the test failure by increasing the wait time.

Given the above understanding and the fact that the test passes with high probability, this flaky test does not indicate bug and should not be a blocking issue for 2.1.0 release.
