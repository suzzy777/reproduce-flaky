Failing test cases generally log error message as 

{noformat}
java.lang.AssertionError: Unexpected bean exists! expected:<0> but was:<1>

JMX Bean name0=ReplicatedServer_id7 indicates that QuorumBean is not cleared from a server with id 7.  In test cases servers ids are starting with 1. So this means this QuorumBean is not registered from test cases which is starting 7 servers. In whole zk I can find two test cases which are starting 7 servers 
* ReconfigTest.testBulkReconfig
* ReconfigTest.testQuorumSystemChange

So definitely these test cases some how not cleaning up the QuorumBean. 

I checked code, QuorumBean is cleaned when Quorum is shutdown
{code:java}
} finally {
            LOG.warn("QuorumPeer main thread exited");
            MBeanRegistry instance = MBeanRegistry.getInstance();
            instance.unregister(jmxQuorumBean);
            instance.unregister(jmxLocalPeerBean);

            for (RemotePeerBean remotePeerBean : jmxRemotePeerBean.values()) {
                instance.unregister(remotePeerBean);
            }

            jmxQuorumBean = null;
            jmxLocalPeerBean = null;
            jmxRemotePeerBean = null;
        }
{code}

Above two test are shutting down the 7th servers, so this jmxQuorumBean from 7th servers should be cleaned up. But somehow this is not happening.





Another observation is WatcherTest is passing when it run alone. It is failing some times when it run under NettyNettySuiteTest or NioNettySuiteTest.

Based on above two observations, I propose to run the ReconfigTest test in the last in NettyNettySuiteTest and NioNettySuiteTest. As the test assertion are not really important functionality validation,  by changing the execution order we can avoid the test failure.  I will raise the PR.
