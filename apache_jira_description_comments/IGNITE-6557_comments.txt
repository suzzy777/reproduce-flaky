Hi [~VitaliyB],

Can you please replace sleep() with GridTestUtils.waitForCondition(<check predicate>, getTestTimeout()) and then assert that wait returned true? The sleep() is quite unreliable and sensitive to timeout processor changes.

Hi, [~agoncharuk],

Done. I also ran test 10 times on TC.

Hi [~VitaliyB], unfortunately now link seems to be outdated. Could you trigger TC once more time?

Hi [~dpavlov], Done.
