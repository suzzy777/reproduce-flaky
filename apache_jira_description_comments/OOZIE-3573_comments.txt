Thanks for the patch [~arvaiadam] it seems to me you have found other problems in the file, like the additional value after the truststore password description. I'll rename the Jira according to it.

The test failures also indicate that you've changed some default value which caused lots of problems. I think in this change only descriptions should be changed and not default values. (If you'd like to change a default value, please describe it here and we can discuss it).

I've also realized that you've changed lots of formatting, line breaking, which makes it difficult to find the important changes. Can you please upload a patch which only contains the real changes.

[~asalamon74] Thank you for your feedback. Yes, most of the change was because of the formatting. I uploaded a 2nd patch only with real changes. Typos, changed/new description. There is no value change.

Thanks [~arvaiadam] this version is much better. Precommit also likes this. Great typo findings.

A few more suggestions:
 * "multiple class" should be "multiple classes" I think.
 * For the "nameNode.whitelist" and "jobTracker.whitelist" we should also add the information, that we accept comma separated values. Something like "Comma separated list of whitelisted job trackers for Oozie service"
 * I've also realized that the block-copy error is also block-copied to our documentation: [https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/docs/src/site/markdown/AG_HadoopConfiguration.md] Could you please also modify this file.
