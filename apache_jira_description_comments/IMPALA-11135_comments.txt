Hi [~rizaon], I assigned this to you since you have prior experiences resolving similar issues. Please re-assign the JIRA as you see appropriate. Thanks!


Thanks [~fangyurao] , I loop this test in my local machine and indeed found occurrence where it does not spill at all around iteration 127.
There is probably a timing issue or our hash table footprint is a little bit smaller now.

This test is added in IMPALA-9725. The case that is being exercised is spill + wide join key, which happen at fragment "HASH_JOIN_NODE (id=14)".
To pass this test, we want to see SpilledPartitions counter > 0 at "Hash Join Builder (join_node_id=14)".

I notice we can reduce the buffer_pool_limit even lower from 110MB to 105MB to get more consistent spill behavior. The query's Max Per-Host Resource Reservation itself is Memory=104.61MB.
After lowering the buffer pool limit, I loop the test for 1000x and all spill consistently in this fragment instance.
To be specific, these are the num of SpilledPartitions of the first instance (ending with "000d") of "Hash Join Builder (join_node_id=14)" fragment across 1000 query runs.

IMPALA-11135: Deflake LEFT ANTI JOIN test case in test_spilling.py

TestSpillingDebugActionDimensions.test_spilling has been flaky because a
test case from IMPALA-9725 sometimes does not spill its hash join
partition. This patch lowers the buffer_pool_limit of this test from
110MB to 105MB, just slightly above its Max Per-Host Resource
Reservation (104.61MB), to ensure consistent spilling behavior.

Testing:
After lowering the buffer pool limit, I loop the test 1000 times, and
all spill consistently in fragment "HASH_JOIN_NODE (id=14)".
To be specific, these are the num of SpilledPartitions of the first
instance (ending with "000d") of "Hash Join Builder (join_node_id=14)"
fragment across 1000 query runs:

+--------------------+----------+
| #SpilledPartitions | #Queries |
+--------------------+----------+
|                  2 |       30 |
|                  3 |       96 |
|                  4 |      674 |
|                  5 |       52 |
|                  6 |      146 |
|                  7 |        2 |
