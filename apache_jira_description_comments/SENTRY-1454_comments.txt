[~sravya] and [~hahao], please help take a look. It attempts to fix TestHDFSIntegration flaky tests and also unblock post commit job by turning off flaky solr tests.

Thanks [~anneyu]! JFYI, Changes in SENTRY-1377 are overlapping here.

Yeah, but it's difficult to combine these two from this particular jira. I am thinking of checking in this one to unblock post commit then rebase SENTRY-1377, which can happen anytime later, in a more flexible schedule. The main purpose for this jira is to ensure no time out. Refactor can continue going on.

Thank you, [~sravya] and [~hahao] for the code review. Seems we agreed to check-in.

Transferred code review ship-it to +1.

+1, thanks a lot for your contribution Anne!

    SENTRY-1429, SENTRY-1454: fix flaky TestHDFSIntegration, refactor this huge test class, improve its cleanUp and setUp for temp HDFS dirs; divide test class into smoke test class and p2 test class; in post commit run, we will only run smoke tests.
