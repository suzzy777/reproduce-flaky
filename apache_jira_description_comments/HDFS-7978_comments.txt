Hey Walter, I'd prefer if we worked on switching over to slf4j in most of these cases, rather than adding if guards. That saves the string construction cost. I don't think any of the functions you wrapped in this patch are particularly expensive, but if you disagree we can keep the if guards.

Thanks [~andrew.wang]] for comments. 
1. I know little about slf4j, and I looked it. I found that the usage pattern has little different. We need to call something like {{logger.debug(arg1,arg2..)}} .
2. I wrapped something like {{LOG.debug(this +...)}} , So If you look at {{FileJournalManager.toString()}}, {{Token.toString()}}, {{URI.toString()}}, You will find out they are a bit expensive.

Hey Walter, you can pass objects into slf4j log methods without calling {{toString}} on them first, and I believe slf4j only calls {{toString}} if the log level is enabled. This saves the construction and {{toString}} costs.

I found out a lot debug("string", obj1, obj2..), and I didn't wrap them. I won't wrap isDebugEnabled() unless it's necessary. I only wrap what's written by concatenating, like "string" + obj1 + obj2 + "string"

I skipped all:
1. pure "string1" + "string2". ( Because compiler will optimize it)
2. "string1" + obj1 ( only if obj1 is String type, because it's inexpensive)
3. debug("string", obj1, obj2)
4. debug(obj1)

I only wrap these:
1. "string1" + obj1 + "string2" ( concatenating object and String more than 4~5 times)

[~andrew.wang] [~walter.k.su] it sounds reasonable to me to avoid concatenating with LOG.isDebugEnabled guard too. 

We can convert these logs into slf4j-style templated logs to avoid string construction / concatenation overhead, right? Sorry if I wasn't clear about this before.

I just find out that common-logging doesn't support {} placeholder or variable length argument lists. Sorry about that. You are right. We can switch over to slf4j. There are still a lot class use common-logging. It's a long way to go.
I'll appreciate if you can apply the patch so we guard them now. Slf4j also support isDebugEnabled(), I think it's ok. Or we can wait another patch for switching to slf4j. Both works for me. Thanks introducing me Slf4j.

PerformanceAdvisory.LOG is slf4j, so I rewrite the message arguments in template-style.

Make sense. Thank you for clarification!

Sure, I'm okay guarding for now. Will review again when it passes precommit, but it looks generally fine.

Out of curiosity, did you notice these logs as a performance issue on a cluster? These changes seem very targeted.

Sorry about that. I upload a 003 patch.

I ran the failed test locally, seems independently flaky. +1 I'll commit this shortly, doing some slf4j conversions would be another nice contribution if you're interested :)

Thanks for the contribution [~walter.k.su], and [~ozawa] for reviewing too.
