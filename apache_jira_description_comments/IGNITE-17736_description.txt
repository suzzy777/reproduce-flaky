Checks should be performed in parallel.

 

Also, this issue is a good place for repformance tuning.

We have some information from test environment:

idle_verify for *641* partitions with *3* backups with *~ 600k* entries per partition tooks {*}11 minutes{*}, but fix with RELATIVE_MAJORITY strategy tooks {*}16 hours{*}.

Parallel execution should decrease the duration significantly.
