This issue is similar to:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-32963

We are proposing to make the following tests stable:

{quote}org.apache.flink.runtime.state.OperatorStateBackendTest#testSnapshotRestoreSync
org.apache.flink.runtime.state.OperatorStateBackendTest#testSnapshotRestoreAsync{quote}

The tests are currently flaky because the order of elements returned by iterators is non-deterministic.

The following PR fixes the flaky test by making them independent of the order of elements returned by the iterator:
https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/23464

We detected this using the NonDex tool using the following commands:

{quote}mvn edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -pl flink-runtime -DnondexRuns=10 -Dtest=org.apache.flink.runtime.state.OperatorStateBackendTest#testSnapshotRestoreSync

mvn edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -pl flink-runtime -DnondexRuns=10 -Dtest=org.apache.flink.runtime.state.OperatorStateBackendTest#testSnapshotRestoreAsync{quote}

Please see the following Continuous Integration log that shows the flakiness:
