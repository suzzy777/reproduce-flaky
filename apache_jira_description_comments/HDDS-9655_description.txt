Currently couple of tests from *TestOMRatisSnapshots* are flaky 
1. testInstallSnapshotWithClientRead in [run#1|https://github.com/szetszwo/ozone/actions/runs/6788398196/job/18458240559?pr=6] and [run#2.|https://github.com/szetszwo/ozone/actions/runs/6788397892/job/18454049272?pr=6]
2. testInstallIncrementalSnapshotWithFailure in [run|https://github.com/hemantk-12/ozone/actions/runs/6792526427/job/18465960555]
3. Also as mentioned in [HDDS-8876|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-8876].

I took a level at high level and seems like some race condition. For the sake of time and to unblock [HDDS-9192|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9192], mark the whole class flaky so that test run few times. In the follow-up task [HDDS-8876|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-8876], we can investigate the root cause and fix it.
