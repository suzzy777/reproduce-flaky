Few comments based on testing this patch:

I am classifying the comments so as to make it clear which areas to tackle on priority.

*Regressions*
* Tags column is missing for an asset page. Because of this, any attribute added to a tag is not shown anywhere.
* Datatype is not shown for columns
* QuickStart failed even if I didn’t explicitly call the taxonomies API - is this because the UI is making a call nevertheless on load? (In that case, it would probably be ATLAS-805)
* Hierarchical tags are not asking for parent properties.

*Business Taxonomy*
* Cannot add any business term - because there is no Taxonomy to start with. This can be worked around with adding a taxonomy via REST API using curl or postman.
* Added Term created is not refreshed immediately. In general, the return of term information is very flaky. Sometimes it works and sometimes the API is returning a 404. Not very reproducible.

*User Experience*
* Login user name is incorrect on the page.
* The search box is too small for most DSL queries. Similarly, DSL help text is not visible fully.
* The Tags button in results page is not aligned properly with the textual columns.
* Attributes of tags is showing at the same place as tags for assets. I feel this is confusing. In fact the way to add a tag with attributes was a little better in the older model than now.
* The fact that term hierarchy should be navigated by double click is not visibly clear.

*New but incomplete functionality*
* In the Tag page, I cannot delete an attribute, but we show a ‘x’ icon still.
* Click on edit button beside asset name. Cancel. Some text is shown “List of all developer languages used by Pivots to build products and control the behaviour of the machine. This list contains every language used since 2008.”
* Publish button doesn’t do anything now. What is it supposed to do? Likewise for comments text and button.
* Why repeat taxonomy name for every term - because hierarchy is already being shown

I would first the regressions to be addressed so that we would get back to status quo.



The following things worked in general:

* Creating tags with attributes.
* DSL search and full text search.
* Entity details page is mostly complete.
* Adding tags to entities with attributes (ignoring the hierarchical attributes) is working fine.
* Disassociating tags from entities is fine.
* Adding business terms, including hierarchy (although retrieval is flaky as described above).

Tested the latest patch attached here. Verified the following issues are fixed:

* Login user name is incorrect on the page.
** No name is shown now. This can be added in a later patch.

* Tags column is missing for an asset page. Because of this, any attribute added to a tag is not shown anywhere.
** Fixed. Can see the tags tab now and the attribute values are shown.

* Hierarchical tags are not asking for parent properties.
** Fixed. Tested by creating a child tag with attributes. Adding this tag resulted in the UI asking for both parent and child attributes.

* In the Tag page, I cannot delete an attribute, but we show a ‘x’ icon still.
** This is removed now. We can add this later if this functionality is required. Note previous UI did not allow this.

* Click on edit button beside asset name. Cancel. 
** This is removed.

* Publish and comments button
** These are removed as well.

Overall, this is a great improvement in a short time. I am +1 for the patch and will commit this after running tests soon.


I just committed this. Thanks, [~kevalbhatt18] for the contribution and also addressing some of the review comments very fast.
