There are two test suites that are failing now:

 

Python Unit Tests (macos-latest, 3.7, py37): [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12935/checks?check_run_id=1163443154]

 

Python Unit Tests (windows-latest, 3.7, py37): [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12935/checks?check_run_id=1163443198]

 

I am not very familiar with the Python tests suites in GitHub check, but I think this failure should be a release blocker?
