Any update on this one?

No movement on this; making it major.  Not going to let it get in way of cutting a 0.92RC

Since HBASE-4749 has been integrated, is this still needed ?

Jonathan's patch from HBASE-3380, rebased for TRUNK.

Test suite passes.

Will commit later today if no objections.

I had started doing this also -- are you sure you want to keep the 'if (count == oldcount && count > 0) break' line?  It was removed on the 0.90 version.

{code}
+    long slept = 0;
     for (int oldcount = countOfRegionServers(); !this.master.isStopped();) {
       Thread.sleep(interval);
+      slept += interval;
       count = countOfRegionServers();
       if (count == oldcount && count > 0) break;
 
       String msg;
+      if (count == oldcount && count >= minToStart && slept >= timeout) {
+        LOG.info("Finished waiting for regionserver count to settle; " +
+            "count=" + count + ", sleptFor=" + slept);
+        break;
{code}

Before and after test, TestMasterFailover seemed flaky for me on the 0.92 branch.  

Is the plan for this 0.92.0 or 0.92.1?

Thanks for the review Jonathan.
The first break statement should be removed.

I ran TestMasterFailover on MacBook and didn't see failure.

I think this should go to 0.92.0

I think if the tests are no worse than before, 0.92.0 sounds reasonable to me.

+1 on include in 0.92.

Integrated to 0.92 and TRUNK.

Thanks for the review Jonathan and Stack.

{noformat}

I believe that we could set the number of hbase.master.wait.on.regionservers.maxtostart to the exact number of region we want to start. Would be nice not to have the first sleep as well.


I will fix this in HBASE-4993

The parameter "hbase.master.wait.on.regionservers.timeout" is not a full timemout; if we don't have the regionservers.mintostart, we will continue to loop until the master is killed. That's the intend?

I'd doubt it.  IIRC, we're supposed to move on w/ the regionservers that we have after the timeout.
