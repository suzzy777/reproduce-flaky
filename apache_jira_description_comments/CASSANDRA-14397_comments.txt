Patch looks good to me and is needed. Colleague just ran into this issue (albeit on 2.0).

dtests failed because looks like I mistakenly forgot to update the seed_test.py dtests to 3.11.3 so they can safely be ignored.Â 

One nit:
bq. // shitty assert begging to be flaky due to gc pauses etc:
Can we use byteman to make this assert _not_ begging to be flaky?

[~krummas] thank you for the patch! 

+1 LGTM, I just have 2 minor comments (please feel free to address on commit if applicable):

  * We might benefit from also adding the call to {{isStopRequested}} to {{AbortableUnfilteredPartitionTransformation#applyToPartition}}. This way [CompactionManager#doCleanupOne|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/CompactionManager.java#L1158-L1159] and [CompactionTask#runMayThrow|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/CompactionTask.java#L200-L201] won't need to have this logic separately. Also, it will be self-contained in a single class, which might be a good thing. The downside of that is that upstream transformations {{applyToPartition}} calls will be still made, but it might be minor enough considering potentially simpler code. What do you think?
  * I've tried to reuse {{CompactionIteratorTest}} to write a more "precise" test (also, get rid of sleeps there), and so far [this|https://gist.github.com/ifesdjeen/4caf84423fa321ceca79d9b8c041fe0c] was what I came up with. In short, relying on timing is a good thing for review and it was nice to be able to use with this test while reviewing, but testing compaction iterator directly might have a benefit of both knowing that {{CompactionInterruptedException}} is thrown in a precise moment in time, and might remove some flakiness (which to be honest I could not reproduce locally, but as your comment says it begs to).

[~ifesdjeen] thanks for the review, all good points, I have pushed a commit fixing them, tests should be running

and committed as {{bdb52801c7384ef07f7fc0b4f3b965bdf35d821d}}, thanks!
