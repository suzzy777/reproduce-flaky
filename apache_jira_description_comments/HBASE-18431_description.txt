This report includes HBASE-15816 which hasn't been committed yet. Otherwise it's current.

I'm not generally concerned with added methods. 

The following methods have been added to Public/Evolving interface Table. Pointing them out in case it merits review.

\\
* Abstract method Table.getReadRpcTimeout ( ) has been added to this interface.	No effect.
* Abstract method Table.getWriteRpcTimeout ( ) has been added to this interface.	No effect.
* Abstract method Table.setReadRpcTimeout ( int ) has been added to this interface.	No effect.
* Abstract method Table.setWriteRpcTimeout ( int ) has been added to this interface.


The Public/Evolving interface Admin has some signature changes equating to removed methods. I don't think this is allowed in a minor release.

\\
* Abstract method Admin.isSnapshotFinished ( HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription ) has been removed from Admin.
*  Abstract method Admin.snapshot ( String, TableName, HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription.Type ) has been removed from Admin.
* Abstract method Admin.snapshot ( HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription ) has been removed from Admin.
*  Abstract method Admin.takeSnapshotAsync ( HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription ) has been removed from Admin.


The LimitedPrivate(CONFIG) interface AsyncRpcClient has been removed. This change is debatable but I think we can allow it.

\\
* AsyncRpcClient has been removed


The Public/Evolving class FastLongHistogram has been removed. I don't believe this change is allowed in a minor release.

\\
* FastLongHistogram has been removed


Method signatures in LimitedPrivate(COPROC) interfaces MasterObserver and RegionObserver have changed, equating to removed methods. The first set of changes is due to move of SnapshotDescription from HBaseProtos to SnapshotProtos:

\\
* Abstract method MasterObserver.postCloneSnapshot ( ObserverContext<MasterCoprocessorEnvironment>, HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription, HTableDescriptor ) has been removed from MasterObserver.
* Abstract method MasterObserver.postDeleteSnapshot ( ObserverContext<MasterCoprocessorEnvironment>, HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription ) has been removed from MasterObserver.
* Abstract method MasterObserver.postListSnapshot ( ObserverContext<MasterCoprocessorEnvironment>, HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription ) has been removed from MasterObserver.
* Abstract method MasterObserver.postRestoreSnapshot ( ObserverContext<MasterCoprocessorEnvironment>, HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription, HTableDescriptor ) has been removed from MasterObserver.
* Abstract method MasterObserver.postSnapshot ( ObserverContext<MasterCoprocessorEnvironment>, HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription, HTableDescriptor ) has been removed from MasterObserver.
* Abstract method MasterObserver.preCloneSnapshot ( ObserverContext<MasterCoprocessorEnvironment>, HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription, HTableDescriptor ) has been removed from MasterObserver.
* Abstract method MasterObserver.preDeleteSnapshot ( ObserverContext<MasterCoprocessorEnvironment>, HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription ) has been removed from MasterObserver.
* Abstract method MasterObserver.preListSnapshot ( ObserverContext<MasterCoprocessorEnvironment>, HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription ) has been removed from MasterObserver.
* Abstract method MasterObserver.preRestoreSnapshot ( ObserverContext<MasterCoprocessorEnvironment>, HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription, HTableDescriptor ) has been removed from MasterObserver.
* Abstract method MasterObserver.preSnapshot ( ObserverContext<MasterCoprocessorEnvironment>, HBaseProtos.SnapshotDescription, HTableDescriptor ) has been removed from MasterObserver.

Here, maybe DeleteTracker moved packages?

\\
* Abstract method RegionObserver.postInstantiateDeleteTracker ( ObserverContext<RegionCoprocessorEnvironment>, DeleteTracker ) has been removed from RegionObserver.


The LimitedPrivate(COPROC) interface Store has method signature changes equating to removed methods. The changes are debatable. I am thinking we can allow them. Anyone implementing their own Stores?

\\
* Abstract method Store.bulkLoadHFile ( String, long ) has been removed from Store.
* Abstract method Store.getScanners ( List<StoreFile>, boolean, boolean, boolean, boolean, ScanQueryMatcher, byte[ ], byte[ ], long, boolean ) has been removed from Store.
* Abstract method Store.getScanners ( boolean, boolean, boolean, boolean, ScanQueryMatcher, byte[ ], byte[ ], long ) has been removed from Store.
* Abstract method Store.upsert ( Iterable<Cell>, long ) has been removed from Store.
