This seems to happen with CUSTOM INDEXES too

Patch for cassandra trunk version attached  (although you can fast-foward the 3.0 patch), You can also see changes on my forked repository: https://github.com/javiercanillas/cassandra/tree/13935-trunk

Thanks Javier, change seems straightforward enough to me. I've kicked off unit tests.

|[3.0|https://circleci.com/gh/kgreav/cassandra/142]|[3.11|https://circleci.com/gh/kgreav/cassandra/143]|[trunk|https://circleci.com/gh/kgreav/cassandra/144]|

Looks like this breaks {{indexWithfailedInitializationIsNotQueryableAfterPartialRebuild}} on trunk which didn't exist on 3.11. Need to check if it's important. Error was:
{code}
    [junit] junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
    [junit] 	at org.apache.cassandra.index.SecondaryIndexManagerTest.indexWithfailedInitializationIsNotQueryableAfterPartialRebuild(SecondaryIndexManagerTest.java:475)
{code}

[~KurtG] where are you testing this? I might try and fix the problem. Tell me which branch please.

[~Kani] that was on the trunk unit tests I had run above, but it appears flaky after multiple re-runs. I've rebased the trunk patch and kicked off the tests again [utests|https://circleci.com/gh/kgreav/workflows/cassandra/tree/13935-trunk]


Same holds for UDTs when a snapshot is taken, there is not IF NOT EXISTS there.

I ll hijack this issue due to inactivity, feel free to raise your voice if you want to still finish this.

PR: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/731

I have added UDTs as well. I have consolidated all "CQL toString". The default behaviour is as it was and it is not changed, this just improves the output for cases like snapshots.

[~snazy] would you please make a review of this code? I saw you as the author of SchemaCQLHelper as part of CASSANDRA-14825

[~blerer] would you mind to review please? I need 2 reviewers so one more would be awesome!

[~stefan.miklosovic] sure. I should be able to do that next week. 

The patch for 4.0 looks good to me. I think we would need one for 3.0 and 3.11.

Sorry, I'll probably not have time to review.

PR for 3.11 https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/739

PR for 3.0 https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/740

[~blerer] please review again, is there anything else I can do in this matter?

Thanks [~stefan.miklosovic]. The code looks good.
I will run CI on your branches.

[~adelapena] would you have sometime to do a second review?  

| [3.0 CI|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/13/] | [3.11 CI|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/8/] | [4.0 CI|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/9/]|


The 3.11 and 4.0 branches CI looks good. Something weird occured with the 3.0. Relaunching it.

CI results looks good. +1 on my side


[~stefan.miklosovic] [~blerer] Changes look good to me too, +1. The only thing to mention is that, if I'm right, for UDF/UDA in trunk we don't seem to have any call passing {{true}} to the new {{ifNotExists}} argument in {{toCqlString}}, nor even in tests. I don't think that's a problem, given how simple the change is.

 

Thanks [~adelapena]. It is a valid point.

[~stefan.miklosovic] could you add a test for that in {{UFJavaTest}}?

[~blerer] Test added in UFJavaTest.

I havent found any way how to test that in 3.11. I could not find a place where we are producing CQL from UDF nor UDA. There is just a ColumnFamilyCQLHelper (something like that) and it does not dump functions nor aggregates. Aggregates and functions are not associated with a CF but with a keyspace and there isnt any "toCQL" on a function (hence aggregate) either. UDF and UDA are not part of CQL schema dump upon taking a snapshot as the original goal of this ticket was not to dump them anyway, just indexes are udts.

[~blerer] I believe everything is in place. Are you ok with merging?

Sorry, [~stefan.miklosovic]. I was busy with something else. I will commit today.


Patch committed into branch cassandra-3.0 at 277d83961c7332941a9339bf890dbe0c89029ae3 and merged into cassandra-3.11 and trunk

Hi [~blerer],

there are three branches, trunk, 3.11 and 3.0, each branch does something different. Please resolve this.

https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/731 this is for trunk

https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/739 this is for 3.11

https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/740 this is for 3.0

My comments from 8th September are mentioning them.

Each branch is special for each Cassandra branch.


Sorry by bad. It IS there, as merge commit. That is very confusing.

Thank you very much.
