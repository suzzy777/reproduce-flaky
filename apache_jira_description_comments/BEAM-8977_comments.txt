The flakiness is caused by indeterministic execution of asynchronous tasks to be tested.

Affected by the performance of the system executing the tests, it's possible that during the 1 second sleep, the asynchronous task is not executed at all.

However, adding a list length check, increasing the sleeping time or setting an await with timeout will not resolve the test flakiness issue.

If the asynchronous scheduled task is not executed for at least 2 iterations, there is nothing to be tested and a failure/success will not help with the tests.

I'll remove the flaky unit test since it's flaky in its nature. Mocking such asynchronous mechanism doesn't give us anything, so we will not test the asynchronous mechanism.

I'll add a different test for the underlying asynchronous task and test the logic synchronously.

 

 

 

Thanks, [~ningk]! Let's reopen this if the error happens again.
