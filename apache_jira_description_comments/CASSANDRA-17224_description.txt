There are some existing metrics within {{CQLMetrics}} that provide metrics about prepared statements. We should expose those through a virtual table.

+Additional information for newcomers:+

A new class should be created for representing the new Virtual Table in {{org.apache.cassandra.db.virtual}}. You can look at {{ThreadPoolsTable}} for an example.
The new table will need to be registered in {{SystemViewsKeyspace}}.
Some unit tests will need to be added. For some example of virtual table tests you can look at {{SystemPropertiesTableTest}} and for some example of test around prepared statement metrics you can look into {{CQLMetricsTest}}.
