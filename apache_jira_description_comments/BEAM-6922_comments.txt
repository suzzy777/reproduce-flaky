I have a branch that is ready for replacing this dep https://github.com/echauchot/beam/tree/BEAM-4164-cassandra-embedded-nonLGPL but it requires a feature in the embedded cassandra library that I did and that was merged but not released. I'm discussing internally with the PMC about what we do for the release. A possible workaround would be to avoid delivering the cassandraIO tests jars to avoid delivering code that depends on a LGPLV3 dependency.

In the meantime, I will remove cassandraio-test jars from the delivery

[~apilloud] I cannot find a way to change the gradle build to exclude cassandra-io-test jars from the building/publishing process. Do you know how to do that ? The aim is to reactivate publishing when the PR above can be merged (when Achilles is released)

I think replacing `testCompile` with `testRuntimeOnly` will do what you want? Not sure if that solves the publishing issue though. [~kenn] or [~lcwik] might know more about excluding jars from gradle publish.

Can we just sickbay a couple of tests and merge the branch?

[~apilloud] what you suggest will still deliver test jar but without bundling the LGPL lib. AFAIK the problem is delivering code that depends on this lib. So it does not solve the problem I think.
[~kenn] Sorry but I don't understand your point, how does deactivating a couple of tests solves the problem ? Did I miss something ?
Also to merge the branch it requires a release of Achilles. What I can do is to hack it up with reflexion/byte code manipulation to avoid waiting.

Done, I excluded the cassandra-test and cassandra-test-sources jars from publication in the PR linked to this ticket. This is just to unblock the release. I know the author of Achilles and I asked for a special release including my fix. Let's see. When it's done we can merge the replacement PR https://github.com/echauchot/beam/tree/BEAM-4164-cassandra-embedded-nonLGPL

That is a helpful first step. Nice job getting it done quickly.

It is still a problem to have code part of the Beam project but not part of releases. The same reasoning that we cannot use Cat X in tests also means we can't just choose not to release test code. Otherwise we could always just not release any tests. But tests are an integral part of the project.

Can we help do an Achilles release?

[~kenn] that is what some ASF projects do. I opened a ticket on Apache Camel that uses the same LGPL lib and they answered that there is no problem because they do not deliver tests code/jars
I already offered my help to the author of Achilles. He said that he will try to find time to release with my fix (only commit since last release) this week end.

[~apilloud]. My friend of the Achilles project released Achilles this week end to include my JMX fix (only commit since last release :) ) so I could submit the replacement PR: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8182. Once it is merged, you can release Beam 2.12


[~apilloud] FYI I checrry picked my PR commits into release branch in this PR: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8195
