I've checked the number of jars in the Oozie sharelibs and realized that git sharelib contains the highest number of jars (203), it's much more than the hive (85), pig (67). Not to mention that we have really small sharelibs like distcp (3).

I don't really understand the reason for this, we need to check if we really need all the jars here. The huge number of jars make it slower and it's more likely that we get strange errors because of jar conflicts.
