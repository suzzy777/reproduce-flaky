I think this is because status（HTableMultiplexerStatus ） not update， so the status hold the old data.

[~nkeywal] Does your patch accomodate binlijin's comment?  Otherwise +1... go for it.  Try it.

When I read the comments in the code, I understand that we're supposed to keep the HTableMultiplexerStatus. This said the code does not behave correctly, so all there are a lot of possible guesses.

I think the patch I proposed is ok, even if others are acceptable as well. So I will commit it if nobody objects.
