[~amashenkov] , according to your comments, I added the following changes:
* set job synchronization using Latch instead of Thread.sleep()
* set test timeout = 2 minutes
* use existing LOCAL_IP_FINDER

"assert ignite instanceof IgniteKernal" wasn't added because some tests use mock objects instead of IgniteKernal
(GridTcpCommunicationSpiConcurrentConnectSelfTest for example)

Please take a look.

[~guseinov],

Fix looks good for me can be merged if there is no TC issues.

[~amashenkov] , thank you

[~dpavlov] ,

23 new failed test. I checked them and they look flaky.

Thanks.

* Skip sending messages if a client is disconnected.
 * Throw IgniteCheckedException if a client node is disconnected and communication client is null.

Test looks like a newly introduced failure:
 Ignite Queries [1] [ tests 1 ]    
   IgniteBinaryCacheQueryTestSuite: IgniteSqlSplitterSelfTest.testReplicatedTablesUsingPartitionedCacheClientRO (master fail rate 0,0%) 

[~guseinov], could you please check reasons of this failure?

[~dpavlov] , thanks for your comment and for restarting "Ignite Queries [1]".

The test was passed: [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1181645&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_IgniteQueries&tab=buildResultsDiv]

 

Patch looks good to me, let's consider this test failure is not related to fix. Let's keep an eye on TeamCity.

But I would like to get here approve from Ignite veteran, so if [~vozerov], you will be able to take a look it would be great.

[~guseinov], [~dpavlov], patch looks simple to me, but I have some doubts anyway:
1) Now we do not cancel child tasks in case of disconnect. Is it? Could it lead to some uncompleted futures or so?
2) When client is not connected, we do not throw an exception, but just exit {{send}} method. Ack closure is not notified either. Can we throw an exception instead? What would be the consequences?

[~vozerov] ,thanks for your comments.
1) Yes. It does not lead to uncompleted features. Actually, it prevents uncompleted features when createTcpClient returns null.
2) I agree with that. Added an exception instead of log message. Even if we try to cancel jobs worker.finishTask(null, err, {color:#cccccc}cancelChildren:{color} true), futures will be completed and we will get IgniteClientDisconnectedException.

"Ignite Platform CPP Win32" has compilation issues which are not related to the fix.

New failed tests - 41. Restarted tests:
 * [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1185415&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Basic2]
 * [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1185413&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_ActivateDeactivateCluster]

Other failed tests look flaky.
