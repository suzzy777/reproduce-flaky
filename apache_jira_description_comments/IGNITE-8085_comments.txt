[~ivanan.fed] I looked at your patch. Looks good to me.

Please note recently testStopNodes began to fail continiously with almost 100% rate. Would this change fix this issue also?

Also consider closing ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-538 once this would be merged

[~dpavlov], I researched this issue and it seems similar problem. I ran this test locally 600 times and it's done. I think, I can assign this ticket on me.

Also I want to clarify what was done in this ticket.

Start remote node via ssh has next logic: in StartNodeCallableImpl script [1] to start node and session for this [2] are formed. If info about successful start node was found in logs, ClusterStartNodeResultImpl.isSuccess() returns true, otherwise IgniteException "Remote node could not start. " will be thrown [3].

I suppose that tests failed due to there is not enough time to check logs and although remote node was started, exception is thrown and tests fail. I increase time and iterations for check and tests became green, locally (600 times) and on TC(100 times). I think this fact confirmed my assumption.

[3][https://github.com/apache/ignite/blob/master/modules/ssh/src/main/java/org/apache/ignite/internal/util/nodestart/StartNodeCallableImpl.java#L285]

[~dpavlov], also I found the similar ticket IGNITE-5883: build logs weren't kept, but I looked at recent history of this tests and found that causes of fails are also relates with "Remote node could not start. " exception. I suppose that IGNITE-5883 could be closed after this would be merged. What do you think?

[~ivanan.fed] please feel free to assign all tickets to you.

But currently I don't understand why timeouts change helps to solve a number of test failures (I mean NODE_START_CHECK_PERIOD  & NODE_START_CHECK_LIMIT ).

Currently start nodes is really hot failure from point of view of MTCGA:
[Start Nodes]
	org.apache.ignite.internal.IgniteStartStopRestartTestSuite: org.apache.ignite.internal.IgniteProjectionStartStopRestartSelfTest.testStopNodes
	org.apache.ignite.internal.IgniteStartStopRestartTestSuite: org.apache.ignite.internal.IgniteProjectionStartStopRestartSelfTest.testStartFiveNodesInTwoCalls
	org.apache.ignite.internal.IgniteStartStopRestartTestSuite: org.apache.ignite.internal.IgniteProjectionStartStopRestartSelfTest.testRestartNodesFiltered
	org.apache.ignite.internal.IgniteStartStopRestartTestSuite: org.apache.ignite.internal.IgniteProjectionStartStopRestartSelfTest.testStopNodesByIds
	org.apache.ignite.internal.IgniteStartStopRestartTestSuite: org.apache.ignite.internal.IgniteProjectionStartStopRestartSelfTest.testStartThreeNodesAndDoEmptyCall

Would other test be fixed by this change.

Who could we ask to approve changing of these timeouts?

[~ein], could you please step in and comment timeouts change: NODE_START_CHECK_PERIOD & NODE_START_CHECK_LIMIT ?

[~dpavlov], remote process startup procedure does the simple assumption - {{SUCCESSFUL_START_MSG}} have to occurs in the startup log (remote process output), so the local process wait for the occurrence scanning the log {{NODE_START_CHECK_LIMIT}}-times with {{NODE_START_CHECK_PERIOD}}-delay. Remote process may not had enougth time to finish startup sequence, making mistaken failure. You may sure of that looking at the test run artifacts.

In such situations preferred to increase {{NODE_START_CHECK_LIMIT}}. Increasing {{NODE_START_CHECK_PERIOD}} is not recommended as this lengthens successfully ran tests.

[~ein], thank you for description!

I correctly understand, that increasing of  NODE_START_CHECK_LIMIT will be enough in this case?

[~ivanan.fed],

Yes, right.

[~ivanan.fed] thank you. I've merged this fix. Let's see if it helps.

[~ein], thank you for giving this valuable advice.

Re IGNITE-5883:

Yes, failures there were of the same reason: remote node could not start

As it is fixed now, I set IGNITE-5883 to duplicate.

Thanks [~ivanan.fed] for pinning this down

[~ivanan.fed]

On closer look 50_000 ms timeout exceeds more general timeout. 

I submitted patch in IGNITE-8533 and reopened IGNITE-5883

 

[~ivanan.fed] could you please review patch https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-8533

What do you think it is reasonable to reopen this issue?

[~dpavlov], I think it's reasonable to create new ticket for this problem, because now we can see that problem in the implementation, not in tests.

Now I see two reasons of this failure: problems with shell execution and log can be absent. [~ein], can there be a problem here with third-party library jsch?

In addition I noticed another problem in tests: during afterTest execution assert on leftLatch.await [1] can fails and G.stop(true) doesn't happen. 

I think we should wrap it into try{} finally{} and place G.stop(true) and reset of counters and latches in finally block.

[~dpavlov], what do you think?

[1][https://github.com/apache/ignite/blob/master/modules/ssh/src/test/java/org/apache/ignite/internal/IgniteProjectionStartStopRestartSelfTest.java#L179]

 

[~ivanan.fed] it does not matter we need to fix only test or code, we are free to reclassify this ticket to bug or even to improvement.

If you are ready for contribute fix in code, it is up to you to create separate ticket (related/linked to this) or reopen current ticket.

As far as I know [~Mmuzaf] can advice about correct test stopping approach, [~Mmuzaf], please step in.

[~dpavlov], I made ticket on this problem: [IGNITE-8469|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-8619].
