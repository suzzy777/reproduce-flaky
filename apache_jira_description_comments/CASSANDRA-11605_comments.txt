On first glance, I suspect this is a bug. I'll look at it though

It's actually failed a number of times:

http://cassci.datastax.com/job/cassandra-2.2_dtest_win32/217/testReport/repair_tests.repair_test/TestRepair/dc_parallel_repair_test/history/

So, flaky test.

[~JoshuaMcKenzie], it was my understanding that we shouldn't see errors like this on 2.2+ on Windows anymore?

{code}
ERROR [NonPeriodicTasks:1] 2016-03-31 23:44:07,371 SSTableDeletingTask.java:83 - Unable to delete d:\temp\dtest-mr7s9s\test\node2\data2\ks\cf-a61921b0f79911e581805f908c518710\la-1-big-Data.db (it will be removed on server restart; we'll also retry after GC)
{code}

Reference CASSANDRA-9658. Due to perf. delta for buffered vs. mmap idx reads, I re-enabled mmap'ed path on Windows w/some infrastructure surrounding it to try and recover on failed deletions. Seeing this message on Windows is possible though should be infrequent.
