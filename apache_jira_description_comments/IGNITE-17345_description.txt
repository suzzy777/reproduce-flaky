The crucial point to understand ThinClient performance is to know - Partition Awareness enabled or not.
For now, it's impossible to understand how many request goes to node that is primary for key.

It seems useful metrics to analyze PA behavior - two counters to track amount of requests for each server node 
- one counter for keys current node is primary.
- another counter for keys which require extra network hop between server nodes to serve the request.


For environment with optimal performance second counter should be close to zero.
