Originally, this issue was about serializing custom resources along with normal resources in the RM apps and scheduler webservice endpoints.

However, as YARN-7817 implemented this sooner, this issue is a complement of YARN-7817, adding several unit tests to verify the correctness of the responses of these webservice endpoints.
