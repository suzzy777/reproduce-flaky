I need to put a logical AND into an expression in an oozie bundle (in the enabled flag on the coordinator). When I try "{{A && B}}", oozie gives me a perfectly understandable error about this being invalid XML ({{XML schema error, The entity name must immediately follow the '&' in the entity reference.}}). But when I try to replace this with an XML entity ({{A && B}}), I get an unexpected error that seems to indicate that a space (or something else) is getting injected unexpectedly into my expression:
{noformat}
Bundle Job submission Error: [E1004: Expression language evaluation error, Encountered "&", expected one of ["}", ".", ">", "gt", "<", "lt", "==", "eq", "<=", "le", ">=", "ge", "!=", "ne", "[", "+", "-", "*", "/", "div", "%", "mod", "and", "&&", "or", "||", ":", "(", "?"]]
{noformat}
Any idea how I can get the expression "A && B" to be parsed correctly in an oozie bundle.xml file?

It turned out to be a bug in Oozie.
