In MRCompiler loadfuncs are instantiated at multiple locations in different visit methods. This is inconsistent and confusing. LoadFunc should be instantiated at only one place, ideally in LogToPhyTanslation#visit(LOLoad). A getter should be added to POLoad to retrieve this instantiated loadFunc wherever it is needed in later stages of compilation.
