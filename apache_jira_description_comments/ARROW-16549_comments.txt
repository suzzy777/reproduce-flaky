cc [~westonpace] I think this make sense. Also it is easier for the user. I think it would be okay to have it as a field within the `Aggregate` and put it in `arrow::compute::` namespace as you're suggesting. But `call` is much straight forward. 

But to make it clear to the user, I would say the struct is fine for now. WDYT?

How about including `names` field within the aggregates? cc [~westonpace] 

I have added the main change which is moving 'target` inside the `Aggregate` object. 

But the current change breaks the `R`-bindings. And looking at this specific piece of code, 

[https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/c032290b9ea2699ce29f4fa26e6826911e13fcca/r/R/query-engine.R#L125]

I think, may be we can put the names inside the Aggregate? (optional or user-provided).

Appreiciate your thoughts,  [~npr]

Moving {{names}} inside of the {{Aggregate}} makes a lot of sense to me.  I think that's a good idea.
