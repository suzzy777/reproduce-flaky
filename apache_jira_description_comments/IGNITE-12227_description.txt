baselineAutoAdjustEnabled can be been different on different nodes because of the calculation of default value happening locally on each node and including only local configuration. It issue can happen by the following reasons:
*  If IGNITE_BASELINE_AUTO_ADJUST_ENABLED flag set to a different value on different nodes it leads to cluster hanging due to baseline calculation finishing with the unpredictable state on each node.
* if cluster in mixed mode(included in-memory and persistent nodes) sometimes flag is set to a different value due to calculation doesn't consider remote nodes configuration.

Possible solution(both points required):
* Get rid of IGNITE_BASELINE_AUTO_ADJUST_ENABLED and replace it by the explicit call of IgniteCluster#baselineAutoAdjustEnabled where it required(test only).
* Calculating default value on the first started node as early as possible(instead of activation) and this value always should be set to distributed metastorage(unlike it happening now). It means that instead of awaiting activation, the default value would be calculated by the first started node.
