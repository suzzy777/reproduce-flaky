[~tedyu@apache.org] found that the amended testRegionAssignmentAfterMasterRecoveryDueToZKExpiry by the patch failed for security build. 

The reason is that there are two listeners are registered when constructing rpcServer which won't be reinitialized during master recovery so we will miss these two if we clean all existing listeners during master recovery.
{code}
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.token.ZKSecretWatcher
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.ZKLeaderManager
{code}

Therefore, the simple approach is to remove a old listener instance of the same class when trying to add a new one. 

The master recovery logic on ZK session expired is problematic, I think we may need discuss it in a separate thread.




Is this addendum or replacement? Should we revert the old patch and then apply the new one?

They are addendum patches which are based on the old patch. Thanks.

Would a better approach be to just not add the listeners again?
We're not readding the ZKSecretWatcher during session expiry, can we just do the same for the ZKLeaderManager?

{quote}
Would a better approach be to just not add the listeners again?
{quote}
The addendum patch is using the above approach. If re-initialization code tries to add a new listener, we'll replace the old one of the same class otherwise just leave old listener instances there.
The reason we have to replace old listener instances is that we re-create these listener instances such as AM , SplitLogManager etc during master recovery.

patch looks reasonable, although the default behavior of replacing listener may be unobvious to the caller. I'd remove the one-arg overload of register, and make the parameter mandatory, and also name it better ("allowMultipleInstances"?). Do tests pass on secure build?

{quote}
Do tests pass on secure build?
{quote}
Yes, I verified the test for secure build. 

The default behavior is implicitly required by current code because all existing listeners expect a single instance of its kind registered otherwise we have more issues. The reason I provided another registerListener call to possible register more instances of same class is in case we need it in special situations. I can remove it if it's confusing.

+1 addendum.

I will commit later today if there are no objections, to all 3 branches

Scratch that... org.apache.hadoop.hbase.procedure.TestZKProcedureControllers#testZKCoordinatorControllerMultipleCohort fails for me on 94 with this patch, and passes without on the same clone. Can you check?

Addendum v2 fixes TestZKProcedureControllers

This is exactly why I commented above about dangerous defaults :)
Can you please remove the one-parameter method, so that every caller has to decide explicitly, and add javadoc? I will run the tests meanwhile...

In the interest of keeping HBase in a releasable state let's either commit the addendum or revert the original patch until we have a full solution no later than tomorrow.


I scanned though the code about registerListener and found we use them in various ways. So I came up the v3 addendum which is really an addendum to my original patch. 

It basically remember what listeners are registered before master initialization so that we can add them back during master recovery when we cleaned all old listeners. 

Since the changes are limited to master recovery, it's a low risk change.

I run the whole test suit against trunk and 0.94 security build. Both passed

A few comments about addendum v3:
{code}
+  public List<ZooKeeperListener> getListeners() {
+    return new ArrayList<ZooKeeperListener>(listeners);
{code}
Should a read-only copy be returned ?
{code}

{code}
'them' -> 'listeners'
{code}
+  private List<ZooKeeperListener> registeredZKListenersBeforeInitialization;

Looking at ArrayList source code, Arrays.copyOf() is used internally.
So getListeners() doesn't have to change.

[~apurtell] The latest addendum is to address the security build failures.

I also run the full test suit against 0.94 unsecurity build and it passed. 

Thanks.

The v4 patch just rename changes which address Ted's feedbacks.
