    [ZEPPELIN-2222] Add Network Visualization

    ### What is this PR for?
    This issue is about a new network visualization that can leverage the Property Graph Model (https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Property-Graph), but also simple graphs in order to provide a set of base apis that can be used by graph dbs (like Neo4j) or graph processing frameworks (like GraphX or Giraph).
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    [Feature]
    Is related to the #1582
    
    ### Todos
    * [x] - Added the intepreter apis to manage graphs (under the pakage **org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.graph**)
    * [x] - Added the frontend apis to manage graphs (via d3js)
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?

    @conker84 Pretty graph! I have one question.
    
    - It's looks like new display system works with backend interpreter.
    - And enabled when we click the `network` visualization icon.
    
    So, what happens when we click 'table` or other visualization icons in the situation? (the screenshot you attached.)


Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    @1ambda the graph is flatten by javascript apis so we can leverage the other visualizations provided by Zeppelin
    I'll add a video asap to show how it works!

    @conker84 FYI, you can simply just take a GIF using software called **LICEcap**, and upload it directly here with drag and drop :)


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    I will test and give you feedback soon.

    Hi guys any news/feedback?

    Hi guys i'm still here, let me know if i can do something to simplify the review!


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    @conker84 Thanks for this nice contribution. We introduced Spell in the latest release. Spell helps you contribute this kind of wonderful visualization as easier than now. @1ambda Can you guide to convert it to Spell?


Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    @jongyoul thanks for the answer, i checked the [Spel](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/snapshot/development/writingzeppelinspell.html) and the [Visualization](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/development/writingzeppelinvisualization.html) and i understood they are **front-end only**. This contribution is a mixed front/back-end becouse it want to provide a set of base api in order to enable graph-databases's  exploration (like Neo4j or others) with Zeppelin.
    This contribution is the first step of #1582 the second is to implement the Neo4j Interpreter on top to the GraphResult apis.
    If you guys think there is a more valuable solution to this i'm happy to talk about!


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    I think this is introducing a new result type from interpreter on the backend side that could be useful for this new Neo4J interpreter and other graph-base ones in the future?



Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    Yes it is!


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    Really sorry for late reply. I missed notification for a while. 
    
    - Spell might use JSON output of neo4j interpreter utilizing [sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/), [vis.js](http://visjs.org/network_examples.html)
    - Having default network display system using generalized graph model (Property Graph Model) would be good idea. 
    - Personally, hope to get more refined, pretty graph UI instead of d3 network.
    
    
    
    
    



Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    The #1582 initally was with sigma.js but i found a strange memory consuption that broke the browser after the #1529 so i migrated to d3 network visualization, i chose d3 instead of vis.js in order to reduce project's dependencies.
    I you want i can try with vis.js!


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    It's just my opinion. Thus, it's ok to use d3 if you think it's reasonable 👍 


Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    We are talk about graphdb, the UI is an important part of the PR, as well as the new interpreter apis!
    I'm looking forward to your feedback.


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    UI can be improved in the following PRs. So it's ok not to resolve the whole things in this PR. 


Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    Let me know if you want go ahead with this PR or i have to close it!


Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    Ok! So i'll rebase the code ASAP.


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    FYI, i didn't mean you have to create other PRs. Others can improve UI.


Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    Done!


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    @conker84 you should rebase based on master, not other branch. Currently, your change mixed with others.

Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    Do you mean the conflicts ? You need to do git rebase 


Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    Yes i made the rebase but it starts from the history **dc7b100** instead of **43352ae** and i can't understand why.
    Have you some ideas?
    Thanks


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    Please rebase it upon upstream master branch

    Hi, @conker84 
    
    Here is failed JOB and looks irrelevant. But could you make CI green? 
    
    - https://travis-ci.org/conker84/zeppelin/jobs/227364420
    
    you can click `restart` button in travis. 


Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    i tried but it still fails...


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    1. Regarding to `continuous-integration/appveyor/pr — AppVeyor build failed`, you should rebase. Since master has `.appvepor.yml` file. 
    
    2. In case of Jenkins, you are failing to profile 3 (selenium test)

    They might be flaky tests. You can simply pass them by clicking `restart` button in travis. 


Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    It should be ok now

    @conker84 Hi, I have a question. I'm not sure but classes under org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.graph is used only for testing it. Can you verify it? If it does, can you move these classes under test?


Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    @jongyoul this contribution is the result of the split of #1582 in two little PR; the classes under `org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.graph` provide the basic abstraction that can be used by graph dbs (like Neo4j, OrientDB, ArangoDB etc...) or graph processing frameworks (like GraphX or Giraph) and they will be used by the second part of the contribution which is the Neo4j interpreter, if you think is more appropriate I can move these classes into the second contribution.


Github user conker84 commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    Still no news?

    Hi guys,
    i'm still waiting an answer, maybe there is no interest to this PR, it's ok for me but just give me some feedback. Sorry if i bother you but I need this with the Neo4jIntepreter for a small PoC that i have to develop so I need infos in order to plan my work. 
    Thanks


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    Oh, I'm sorry for the late reply. I think you'd better to move those classes into another PR


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2125
  
    Thanks, Will merge it after CI become green
