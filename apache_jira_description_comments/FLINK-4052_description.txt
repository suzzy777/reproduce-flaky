The error is the following:

{code}
ConnectionUtilsTest.testReturnLocalHostAddressUsingHeuristics:59 expected:<testing-worker-linux-docker-e744e561-3361-linux-13/172.17.5.9> but was:</127.0.0.1>
{code}

The probable cause for the failure is that the test tries to select an unused closed port (from the ephemeral range), and then assumes that all connections to that port fail.

If a concurrent test actually uses that port, connections to the port will succeed.
