[~fu2you] Guo, I am sorry this patch has sat in jira for this long. I will help you drive this through. I am going to rebase your patch a bit, because I would like to add a conf variable to turn this on/off.

I corrected the status typo and did a minor refactor on Guo's work.

Added default configuration values to the xml file.

The latest patch HIVE-305.patch.txt looks good and that test which failed is flaky. The only question I have is, shouldn't the configuration variables start with hive? as opposed to stream?

In this patch we are using the same variable as the upstream hadoop.
{code}
public MRErrorThread() {
+      this.reporterPrefix = job_.get("stream.stderr.reporter.prefix", "reporter:");
{code}

I am ok with this because the meaning is the same, and duplicating hadoop variables is something we are trying to avoid. (like the ticket on deprecating hive's speculative execution settings.


Gotcha. Sounds good :)

If someone does the commit please make sure Guo Hongjie is listed as he did most of the work as the assignee.
