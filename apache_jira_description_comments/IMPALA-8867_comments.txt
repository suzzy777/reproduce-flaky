IMPALA-8867: Deflake test_auto_scaling, improve logging

test_auto_scaling sometimes failed to reach the required query rate
within the expected time. This change increases the timeout that we wait
for the query rate to increase. It also adds logging for the maximum
query rate observed to help with debugging in case the issue still
occurs.

Testing: I looped this for a day on my desktop box and did not observe
any issues.

IMPALA-8867: Further deflake test_auto_scaling

A previous attempt to deflake this test by lowering the threshold for
multi-group throughput had improved things but we still saw another
occurrence of test_auto_scaling failing recently. This change lowers the
threshold even further to try and eradicate the flakiness. From
inspecting the logs of the failed run I could see that the new threshold
would have prevented the failure.
