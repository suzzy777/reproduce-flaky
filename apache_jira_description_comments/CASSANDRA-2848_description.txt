Having a max server RPC timeout is good for worst case, but many applications that have middleware in front of Cassandra, might have higher timeout requirements. In a fail fast environment, if my application starting at say the front-end, only has 20ms to process a request, and it must connect to X services down the stack, by the time it hits Cassandra, we might only have 10ms. I propose we provide the ability to specify the timeout on each call we do optionally.
