failed 7 tests looks flaky and do not reproduce locally

[~SGrimstad], my comments:

1) I merged the branch with MVCC and applied some cleanup, to make code more clear.Â 

2) Please re-run tests on TC to make sure that all is OK after MVCC merge

3) See my comment at \{{GridReduceQueryExecutor:327}} - code looks wrong to me. CacheException never co-exist with retry. There should be different if-else branches for error and for retry, producing exceptions with different error messages. Also it is not clear why {{msg}} is used.

fixed reducer

tests - [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1785291&]
