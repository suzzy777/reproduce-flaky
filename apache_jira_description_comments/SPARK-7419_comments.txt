[~tdas], it looks like SPARK-1600 has started re-occurring too.

org.apache.spark.streaming.CheckpointSuite.recovery with file input stream failed recently:

{code}
Set(10, 1, 6, 21, 45, 3, 36, 15) did not equal Set(10, 1, 6, 28, 21, 45, 3, 36, 15)
{code}

Could you look into this please!




OK. I will look at it.

Best Regards,
