Pushed to master. Thanks, Sahil!

[~stakiar], i tried to update this golden file before but could not get success. Could u share the trick to run this test? Thanks.

[~pxiong] yeah I had some trouble with this test. Try running the test on Linux. I was never able to get it to run on OS X, but the test runs on Ubuntu. When running on OS X there is some masked exception that pops up (I'm planning to file a follow up JIRA to make the logging a bit better).
