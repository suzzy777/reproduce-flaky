Another failing seed, on trunk:

ant test  -Dtestcase=TestICUNormalizer2CharFilter -Dtests.method=testRandomStrings -Dtests.seed=FAD491CC06DF54BB -Dtests.slow=true -Dtests.linedocsfile=/lucenedata/hudson.enwiki.random.lines.txt -Dtests.locale=vi_VN -Dtests.timezone=Europe/Jersey -Dtests.asserts=true -Dtests.file.encoding=UTF-8


Test seeds are not useful here. This is incremental version of unicode normalization algorithm, it needs to be a more minimal string, not some huge blob.

Seeds that rely upon some special multi-gigabyte large file are doubly useless :)

LUCENE-5595: try to improve test efficiency

I'd like to re-enable this test. I will open a PR. If jenkins gives us a new seed, we can re-open it and try to drill down.

One thing bogus about the existing test is that it tries to do stuff with {{Normalizer2.getInstance(null, "nfkc", Normalizer2.Mode.DECOMPOSE)}}
I'm surprised it doesn't get IAE for this, it makes no sense.

Also its not great to test different modes all in the same method anyway.
I am looking into splitting this into NFC, NFKC, NFKC_CF, NFD, NFKD tests.

sorry, the previous NFKD test is fine. I thought i read it as NFKC+decompose. Anyway, more argument to splitting the testing up to separate methods, so that if jenkins trips, we might have hints as to the problem. Still testing locally and then I'll make a PR.

LUCENE-5595: re-enable TestICUNormalizer2CharFilter random test, splitting by mode (#211)

Re-enable the randomized testing here, but with a separate test for each
mode rather than all in one method. It gives better testing and also easier-to-debug
testing.

Marking as fixed. Actually all we did is crank the testing up on this issue. But the underlying library has been upgraded a few times since the original issue was opened.

For now, random tests are enabled. If they trip, please open an issue.

Closing after the 9.0.0 release
