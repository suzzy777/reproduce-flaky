Running only the single test method: TestKillQueryWithAuthor​izationDisabled#testKillQueryB​yTagAdmin fails immediately, but even if we run the whole test class, it fails sometimes.
- Single test method run: http://ci.hive.apache.org/job/hive-flaky-check/348/
- Whole class run with fail: http://ci.hive.apache.org/job/hive-flaky-check/351/

We need to fix this before reenabling the tests.
