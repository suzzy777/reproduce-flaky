    GEODE-9854: Orphaned .drf file causing memory leak (#7145)

Since this test is flaky, I recommend that we revert GEODE-9854, fix the test, and then recommit with the new test. Since GEODE-9854 may be in previous releases we want the fix to be as clean as possible.

Hi [~dschneider] ,

It seems that this in not just a flaky test case, but it actually hit one scenario when regionMap for orphaned .drf file is not cleared. From logs it can be seen that regionMap is not cleared when Oplog is closed early (compaction is skipped as there are no live entries in Oplog) :

 
{code:java}
[info 2021/12/15 22:37:18.482 UTC  &lt;Idle OplogCompactor&gt; tid=0x71] Closing DiskRegionCompactorClearsObjectThatAreNoLongerNeededIntegrationTest_testCompactorRegionMapDeletedForOnlyDrfOplogAfterCompactionIsDone_diskStore early since it is empty. It is for disk store oplog#6.{code}
 

When Oplog is closed early then cleanupAfterCompaction function (where regionMap close is called) is not called and therefore regionMap is not cleared.

You can find the test case and the solution for above scenario in following draft commit [https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7208]

 Could you please check it and comment?

I will revert the GEODE-9854: and create new PR that incorporates also above fix.
