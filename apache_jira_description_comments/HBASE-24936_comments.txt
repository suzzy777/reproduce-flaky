wishlist: add a stage that can run on master and abort our builds that use a lot of space when freespace is low. that would let the lighter weight builds keep working.

Example job on ci-hadoop for copying stuff to the nightly host:

https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/infra-test-nightlies/configure

The jenkins build master is full again... Maybe we need to revive this again? Or could we find someone who can donate a master machine with bigger disk?

Upload two detailed usage report on the master node provided by [~gmcdonald].

After a roughly review, for the flaky jobs, seems one of the problems is htmlreports?

{noformat}
zhangduo@zhangduo-ubuntu:~/hbase$ grep -e "HBase/jobs/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/branches/branch-2/builds/126/htmlreports/Flaky_20Test_20Report$" usage-hbase-find-flaky.txt 
115M	HBase/jobs/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/branches/branch-2/builds/126/htmlreports/Flaky_20Test_20Report
{noformat}

So for every build, at least we have a 100MB+ htmlreports...

Need dig more on the actual content.

OK, I think the problem is that, we just publish all the files in our workspaces to the htmlreports... Besides the htmlreports, we only have these small things

This is how we publish the html report
{code}
  post {
    always {
      // Has to be relative to WORKSPACE.
      archiveArtifacts artifacts: "includes,excludes,dashboard.html"
      publishHTML target: [
        allowMissing: true,
        keepAll: true,
        alwaysLinkToLastBuild: true,
        // Has to be relative to WORKSPACE
        reportDir: ".",
        reportFiles: 'dashboard.html',
        reportName: 'Flaky Test Report'
      ]
    }
  }
{code}

Let me google the meaning of the properties of publishHTML  to see what is the problem...


OK, I think the problem is the reportDir...

At least in Jenkinsfile for nightly builds, it is set to the output directory, not the root directory, so I assume it is the directory which we will publish all the files under it(recursively) as the html report.

Let me see how to fix it.

Maybe we should put the output to a special directory to only publish this directory instead of publish '.'.

We were listed again by the INFRA team to eat too much space and they mentioned nightlies.apache.org again...

This is what I got from the jenkins file of Cassandra team:

{code}
    stage('Summary') {
      steps {
          sh "rm -fR cassandra-builds"
          sh "git clone --depth 1 --single-branch https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/cassandra-builds.git"
          sh "./cassandra-builds/build-scripts/cassandra-test-report.sh"
          junit testResults: '**/build/test/**/TEST*.xml,**/cqlshlib.xml,**/nosetests.xml', testDataPublishers: [[$class: 'StabilityTestDataPublisher']]

          // the following should fail on any installation other than ci-cassandra.apache.org
          //  TODO: keep jenkins infrastructure related settings in `cassandra_job_dsl_seed.groovy`
          warnError('cannot send notifications') {
              script {
                changes = formatChanges(currentBuild.changeSets)
                echo "changes: ${changes}"
              }
              slackSend channel: '#cassandra-builds', message: ":apache: <${env.BUILD_URL}|${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}> completed: ${currentBuild.result}. <https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/${env.GIT_COMMIT}|${env.GIT_COMMIT}>\n${changes}"
              emailext to: 'builds@cassandra.apache.org', subject: "Build complete: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName} [${currentBuild.result}] ${env.GIT_COMMIT}", presendScript: '${FILE,path="cassandra-builds/jenkins-dsl/cassandra_email_presend.groovy"}', body: '''

          }
          sh "echo \"cassandra-builds at: `git -C cassandra-builds log -1 --pretty=format:'%h %an %ad %s'`\" > builds.head"
          sh "find . -type f -name \\*.head -exec cat {} \\;"
          sh "xz TESTS-TestSuites.xml"
          sh "echo \"For test report and logs see https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/${JOB_NAME}/${BUILD_NUMBER}/\""
      }
      post {
          always {
              sshPublisher(publishers: [sshPublisherDesc(configName: 'Nightlies', transfers: [sshTransfer(remoteDirectory: 'cassandra/${JOB_NAME}/${BUILD_NUMBER}/', sourceFiles: 'TESTS-TestSuites.xml.xz')])])
          }
      }
    }
{code}

Let's see if we could use these scripts too...

Will keep the branch HBASE-26318 in place for testing later patches as for flaky jobs we need to setup the nightly, flaky tests, and flaky find tests properly. The 3 jobs for HBASE-26318 have already been set up, so let's reuse it.

Thanks.

SSH: Current build result is [FAILURE], not going to run.
{noformat}

I think this is a problem. Let me check how to force the ssh publisher to publish even if the build is failure.

All the sub tasks have been resolved. [~busbey] Do you have any other tasks here? If not I think we could resolve this issue then? Thanks.

I asked infra for a new report on space usage. let's see how we're doing.

here we go: https://paste.apache.org/nzk18

we're at 100GB, but maybe it's just that stuff hasn't aged off yet? looks like a lot is old builds of PRs. maybe we should just truncate those.

Looking at the new pre commit builds, for example, PR-3777, it has 7 builds cached and eats about 305MB space, which is much better than the old builds. For example, PR-3667, which has 6 builds and eats 2.4GB. For pre commit the problem is the stale old PRs, maybe we could ask infra to purge them? Or we write a script to purge them by ourselves.

And it will be good to have a du result for our nightly builds, to see if we eat less space for new builds.

Thanks [~busbey]!

As long as we will move to our dedicated jenkins controller soon, I think it is time to resolve this issue now?
