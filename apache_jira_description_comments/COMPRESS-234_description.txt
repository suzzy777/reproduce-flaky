I have looked over TarBuffer And TarArchiveInputStream and found some ways to improve performance orders of magnitude.

I used a 1 GB TAR archive file (no compression).

Times for reading all entry file names:
Current - 630ms
Mine - 17ms

Times for extracting all entry files:
Current 2446ms
Mine - 2214ms


As you can see, I have enhanced the "skip" methods greatly.  Actual extraction was within a margin of error and the timings bounces around a lot.
