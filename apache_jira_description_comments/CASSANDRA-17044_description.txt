The idea is decompose `Schema` into separate entities responsible for different things. In particular extract what is related to schema storage and synchronization into a separate class so that it is possible to create an extension point there and store schema in a different way than `system_schema` keyspace, for example in etcd. 

This would also simplify the logic and reduce the number of special cases, make all the things more testable and the logic of internal classes encapsulated.
