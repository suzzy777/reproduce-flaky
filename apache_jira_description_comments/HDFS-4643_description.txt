TestQuorumJournalManager can occasionally fail if two consecutive test cases pick the same port number for the JournalNodes. In this case, sometimes an IPC client can be cached from a previous test case, and then fail when it tries to make an IPC over that cached connection to the now-broken connection. We need to more carefully call close() on all the QJMs to prevent this.
