I wouldn't be opposed to this after we're done with the Flume 1.7.0 release

Hi [~liorze], I think this patch is ready to go. I'm going to do a final review and if nobody has any concerns I'll commit it.

Commit 33d19046f0db66c3093f68716e4f6100301d3b49 in flume's branch refs/heads/trunk from [~liorze]
[ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=flume.git;h=33d1904 ]

FLUME-2945. Bump java target version to 1.8

- Removed the unsupported PermSize and MaxPermSize settings from .travis.yml
- Updated DEVNOTES, README and Flume User Guide
- Removed the maven-compiler-plugin from the taildir-source subproject
- Changed the sourceJavaVersion and targetJavaVersion to 1.8 in the root pom.xml
