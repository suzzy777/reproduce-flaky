[~mgergely] since it's related to FLINK-23611, I just wanted to ping you on that one as well: I'm just wondering whether that's something you could pick up as part of the Flink on YARN work.

Hey guys, I am ready to take care about this bug. Please assign it to me, and I will start work on it. [~mapohl]

Thanks [~zchikan] for picking up the task and sorry for not replying earlier. I missed your initial mention.

Talking about the solution of [PR #18687|https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/18687]. I'm not comfortable about changing the log4j properties of {{flink-dist}} to fix some issue in the tests because it also affects production without consulting the mailing list. Sorry for not being precise enough in the issue description. That's my bad.

But thinking about it once more makes me wonder whether we could change the way the log files are selected for evaluation in the YARN tests (see [YarnTestBase:617|https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/da5e7574437dabb82d3cfedf7cebdf7c5ab755b6/flink-yarn-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/yarn/YarnTestBase.java#L617]) and not only look for the actual log file but also log files with {{.[0-9]}} file extension but the same base name

YARN tests are behaving differently on local vs CI. The log file creation and search is both implemented w/ relative directories which makes all those tests flaky. When log files are generated in a different directory which not found by the tests then it times out. I think it would be good to use full path instead of relative to make the tests stable.
