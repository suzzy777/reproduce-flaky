I have encountered this failed yesterday and I have looked the log, I think there maybe a possible that the leader haven't propagated the writes to the followers. What's more I found the original test have {color:#FF0000}“_SleepFor(MonoDelta::FromMilliseconds(1500));”_ {color} to wait the sync between leader and follower, and it was removed on [https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/14016/] . Do we have another method to guarantee that or it's a mistaken deletion.

Good eye; I agree that the second SleepFor was probably keeping the test passing.

That said, I'm not so sure why. With one tserver down, the second round of row insertion must by necessity update both remaining replicas, so by the time we call CountRowsFromClient, all live replicas should have all 200 rows. Maybe it's sufficient for the FOLLOWER replica to make the rows durable in its WAL and not necessarily apply them to the MRS, and then we choose to scan the FOLLOWER? That'd explain the failure.

Anyway, the purpose of the test appears to be to verify that we can write after killing the leader, so a LEADER_ONLY scan following the second batch of inserts should be fine.
