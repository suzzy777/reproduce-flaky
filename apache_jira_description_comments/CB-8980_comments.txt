Hi [~shazron], I'm not familiar with iOS. Can you answer a few questions I have about going about this task?

I'm only planning on having a tag like this:
<image src="res/ios/notification.png" name="notification.png" />
and the iOS config parser will just copy from source to the Resources directory.

I understand that in an iOS app, image files should go into the Resources directory. I see that there is a Resources/icons directory for all the icon.png files and a Resources/splash directory for all of the splash images. 

1. For my case where I'm copying other images that are not the main-app icon or the splash image, can I copy them in a new directory 'Resources/images' and the user would be able to reference those images there?

2. And follow up question is those images don't need to be of any particular size with a corresponding name do they? I see that the icons need specific names depending on their size, so I want to confirm that other images don't have that restriction.


According to [~dpogue]:

It should be pretty quick, involving only changes to the prepare.js
file, probably very similar to the implementation on Android:

[~ktop500] I know it's almost 2 years but I'll get to your questions once I evaluate that PR above

    Bah, objc-tests but seems like it just died when running the Simulator tests, probably a timeout -- flaky. Locally the objc-tests are passing. Running it again by closing and opening the PR.

Commit 28276fc6b59b061809b7b05baca4430f2eea0ad0 in cordova-ios's branch refs/heads/master from [~shazron]
[ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cordova-ios.git;h=28276fc ]

CB-8980 - add missing 'target' attribute test for <resource-file> in config.xml


Implementation Notes:

The overarching goal here is to match <resource-file> support in plugin.xml. With CB-12009 fixed this has been achieved.
Note that on disk (the Resources folder), it will match the target hierarchy specified in the target attribute. However, this hierarchy will *not* be represented logically in the Xcode project as groups. Since the Xcode project in a Cordova project is a build artifact, I didn't deem this to be an important feature.
