I make a PoC. When we replace BaselineManager#nodes with the data nodes from DistributionZoneManager we will see a lot of flaky test.
This is because there is a delay between updating the data nodes in the physical topology that the BaselineManager uses and the data nodes in the DistributionZoneManager.
We need to investigate approach to solve these issue. We can update the tests or create a general solution.
