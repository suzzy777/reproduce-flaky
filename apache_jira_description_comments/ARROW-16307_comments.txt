This is a duplicate of ARROW-12233 I've never been able to reproduce locally. We can maybe skip the test for now. It would help if we could at least get full failure logs (putting the allocator in debug mode should at least give a full traceback for that IllegalStateException, not sure why we don't get it here as I thought this was enabled when running tests)
