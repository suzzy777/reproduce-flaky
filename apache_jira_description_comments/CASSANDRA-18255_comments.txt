WIP

1) Cassandra builds - [https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra-builds/commit/643c664b2da194bd80131423f27aa7bb38c13499]

2) Cassandra - [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...ekaterinadimitrova2:cassandra:18255-trunk]

TODO: add JVM args for NetBeans and eclipse tasks (those tasks were working only with JDK8); 

3) CCM - [https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/ccm/commit/20a3f6221d950832ebf8a4fe935084d52e6851c4]

CircleCI run #2424 looks good - [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=18255-trunk]

I will have to spin also local Jenkins and test. I suspect there should be more places to apply changes to in Cassandra-builds

Just for my clarity, doublechecking:
- J17 failures align to CASSANDRA-16895
- Upgrade test failures align to CASSANDRA-18499
- The rest are timeouts

I will start reviewing Cassandra changes

Edit: [~e.dimitrova] I will need a PR to add comments for the Cassandra changes givent the number of commits. I tried to but I have no permissions... :shrug:

(1) cassandra-builds patch is +1 from me.  I would not bother with local jenkins testing.  I can merge that for you (safely) if i'm awake when you are ready to do so.

+1 on other patches too (agree with Jeremiah's comment).

Some comments so far on the C* code:
- You could leave [this|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...ekaterinadimitrova2:cassandra:18255-trunk#diff-d840184ab2700b185c61c68d7be79c51ce64a3285f5114f76112c8c98f8aff6fL53], it doesn't seem to hurt imo

- I miss CHANGES and upgrade notes, although I know many people prefer to do it just right before the commit.

LGTM otherwise

[~mck] ? The to-do was left from you. Also, just confirming, did you or anyone else try to run the new scripts from CASSANDRA-18133 to verify that I didn't break anything? I asked last night in Slack, but I am not sure whether anyone had the chance to do it, so confirming.

This is the CircleCI readme, so experimental in this case referred to the temporary second CI config for 11+17, which was added for test purposes and now became a primary one. I updated the readme accordingly.

Correct, those will be added at the end.

{quote}(1) Cassandra-builds patch is +1 from me
{quote}
The patch only addresses the test runs, not the builds; we don't need to package any more JDK8 builds. I will look into that.

 

 

The builds will depend on support JDK versions in build.xml.  Let me look into that to confirm it.

I opened a PR also for cassandra-builds - [https://github.com/apache/cassandra-builds/pull/95]

My suspicion was correct, there were three other places to deal with the JDK correct setup. Fixed in this commit - [https://github.com/apache/cassandra-builds/pull/95/commits/a5cee697be3816b2d86fa5469e9f2878a013e2dd]

 

bq. My suspicion was correct, there were three other places to deal with the JDK correct setup. 

See my comment in the PR –  It's not needed.

I do not understand this comment:
{quote}bq. The commit only helps a run that doesn't exist to fail a little faster. These scripts won't be used for trunk soon
{quote}
Where does it fail then? 

If I do not add that check for 8, we will build also with JDK8 for trunk. What do I miss?

Those scripts don't determine which JDKs to try and run with.  That's defined in the groovy dsl file in your first commit in the PR.

Your second commit just makes the script fail earlier if it detects trunk (`java.supported` exists in build.xml but does not contain "8").  But the script would fail anyway as soon as it tries to invoke ant with JDK8.

I saw it now - [https://github.com/apache/cassandra-builds/blob/643c664b2da194bd80131423f27aa7bb38c13499/jenkins-dsl/cassandra_job_dsl_seed.groovy#L391]

Thanks for explaining; I will drop the second commit. :) 

We should also remove Java 8 from RPM and deb packages, like this

https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/redhat/cassandra.spec#L52

That should be bumped to 11 (and 17?)

BTW for some distributions like Amazon Linux (basically a fork of RHEL), there is not "jre-1.8.0" nor "jre-11". There it is called "java-1.8.0" and "java-11". We should fix this for 3.0 up however removal of 1.8 should be part of this I guess ...

bq. BTW for some distributions like Amazon Linux (basically a fork of RHEL)

We're going to have to make a new set of packages there anyway for python, we can handle that on CASSANDRA-18642.

+1

Obtained also +1 from Jacek and Jeremiah offline.
Squashed and rebased ccm and cassandra branches and pushed them under new names so I have the old ones for reference.
https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/pull/new/18255-trunk-final
https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/ccm/pull/new/18255-reviewed

Also, checkstyle targets were extracted in a new build file, so I had to apply the checkstyle-related changes there instead of build.xml.

Running final CI here:
https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=18255-trunk-final

The order of commit on green CI will be:
ccm, cassandra-builds, cassandra patch. We also need to retag the ccm
Also tested locally that nothing shifted in regards to the IDE.
News.txt and CHANGES.txt entries added. The NEWS.txt entry is analogous to what we added when JDK 11 was introduced. We can polish it when we work on CASSANDRA-18233




No new failures, we are ready for commit here. 
A few containers where Python upgrade tests run failed because they did exceed the no out put threshold before getting signaled that the tests already finished (all successfully). It happened a few times lately. I will open a ticket to raise the time to 20 minutes maybe and see if that fixes it.
test_clean is known from CASSANDRA-18325.
All failures from 16895 are presented

Starting commit in a bit:
1) ccm - commit and retag 2) cassandra-builds 3) cassandra

Before doing it, I removed run #1635 from the pipeline of Jenkins (it hasn't started yet).
That one was just testing an increment version for new 4.1 release. 
It will be tested together with this one which is OK.
I expect build #1634 to finish soon and then I will monitor this one for any troubles. I will close this ticket on successful completion of the Jenkins run #1635.

Ninja fix applied:

eclipse-warnings is called directly in the builds scripts, added back a fake task to build.xml, solution already known and tested in CASSANDRA-18190
 https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1636/
Monitoring #1636

I just opened two follow-up tickets, as per the agreement with the reviewers:
- CASSANDRA-18688 - Limit Java runtime in 5.0 to JDK17 in scripts; add a flag to opt out of that
- CASSANDRA-18687 - Add JVM args for Netbeans and Eclipse for JDK11 and 17

Finished with 59 failures, but that is good news as there are no new ones and about half of them will be solved with the following two commits I will push in a few minutes.
SSLFactory class test will continue failing until we add bounty-castle in CASSANDRA-17992. We can probably mark it with @ ignore until then, but I prefer not to, as it can be easily forgotten, and the patch in CASSANDRA-17992 is already in review.
https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1636/#showFailuresLink

Two of the regularly seen flakies are also: test_client_request_metrics (CASSANDRA-18265) and test_decommission timeout. I am closing the ticket. Thank you, all!

We also discovered a rare new flaky related to newer JDK version matters, which never failed before in CircleCI.

I already opened a ticket for investigation -  CASSANDRA-18685

[~e.dimitrova] j11_jvm_upgrade_dtests are [failing|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/1028/workflows/347d7668-7aa9-41d4-a2ee-819226d5a013] in trunk. Known failure 17992 iiuc. Just letting you know but it could also be me having lost track of the expected failures, apologies if it is so.

btw. is this file [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/conf/jvm8-server.options] left on purpose?

No [~jlewandowski] , the files were forgotten unintetionally. A fix below. It should fix also generate.sh which was ignoring silently -e

I am not able to detect new or changed tests with or without the drop jdk patch. Not sure why. Maybe I am doing something wrong

I will follow up later today, the issue is dtest jar packaging, probably triggered in the ecj upgrade ticket. Known also from 17992. I will pull the patch from there to reduce the noise. Thanks

{quote}
I haven't committed the test change, so it wasn't detected...  I did it now, and everything seems to work. 

I just pushed a sanity check CI run now with the free tier. We should see more failures but nothing from these changes, only from insufficient resources.

[https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=fix-circle]

Circle fix lgtm, +1.

Thank you [~brandon.williams] , I also intentionally added the fix in a run for another ticket to be sure I am not breaking anything one more time with the removal of the config file [~jlewandowski] pointed to. - [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2436/workflows/c6e99052-35d0-4bf0-977b-eec08792aa3f]

   ac26b44f9d..5722191a38  trunk -> trunk

jvm-dtest-upgrade on past branches will fail now as building the dtest jarfile can't be done using jdk8.
this needs to be fixed separately in ci-cassandra.a.o and circleci.

ci-cassandra is [fixed|https://the-asf.slack.com/archives/CK23JSY2K/p1690457088204479] with this in cassandra-builds: https://github.com/apache/cassandra-builds/commit/b626e79275b9451506082b70d222d3895caf0882

Thanks, [~mck] 

I fixed CircleCI below, also while removing trunk from the list of branches we need to create dtest jars for,  I noticed we were missing some branches on older branches. I added those. Running CI now to confirm the patches.
