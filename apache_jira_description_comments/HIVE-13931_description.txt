Currently, we use BoneCP as our primary connection pooling mechanism (overridable by users). However, BoneCP is no longer being actively developed, and is considered deprecated, replaced by HikariCP.

Thus, we should add support for HikariCP, and try to replace our primary usage of BoneCP with it.
Note : bonecp is still the default for now, the version of hikaricp being used requires java 8 runtime.
