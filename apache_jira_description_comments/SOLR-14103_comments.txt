jersey-core, jersey-server and netty-all also seem to be redundant. I removed them from the ivy file, running tests now.

SOLR-14103: remove unused dependencies and their checksums, licenses.


I've removed all of these and modified the ivy file. All solr core tests pass.

SOLR-14103: follow up


[~dweiss] is Gradle allowing transitive dependencies? I think hadoop-minicluster is probably pulled in via like hadoop test framework or something.

Gradle does. We don't pull it in though -- it'd be on the list of dependencies under licenses (and it isn't). In fact, I've just removed it from ivy/ ant along with the stuff above and all tests still pass. I think these are just redundant and I'll remove them from master.

You can try the ant build/ tests on gradle-master, Kevin. It's essentially the same code as master with those dependencies removed. I'll commit the removal tomorrow unless somebody can tell me what these are used for (they're only included in test.DfsMiniCluster ivy configuration):

https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=lucene-solr.git;a=commitdiff;h=4b7bb7c

So need to make sure these tests are run on basically any non Windows OS and nightly=true. Otherwise the Hadoop code won't get executed. 

I'll try to run the tests from gradle-master and report back.

Hmmm I ran the HDFS specifics tests on Mac from the latest gradle-master and heck idk why that dependency doesn't need to be there anymore. Everything looks fine to me.

{quote}jersey-core, jersey-server and netty-all also seem to be redundant.
{quote}
I don't know anything about the jersey dependencies, but netty is required to do SSL with ZooKeeper.Â  A smaller subset of dependencies than netty-all MIGHT be workable, that would have to be explored.

I have explored it by running all tests... Ok, I didn't run nightlies or monsters.

Windows is my preferred work environment but that doesn't mean I'm using it for running tests (they're flaky) -- all tests pass on Linux without these dependencies (and since they've been missing from the gradle build since the beginning I'm guessing they were never needed).

Netty packages are imported from solrj and solr-core depends on it. 

I am applying this patch to master. Things need a shakeup to see what is actually used. Please ping me if something starts to fail because of this.
