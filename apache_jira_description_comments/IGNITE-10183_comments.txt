[~gvvinblade], patch is ready for review and merge. TC run is ok. Only relevant suites were checked: {{Client nodes}} and {{Zookeeper 2}}, so there is no visa from TC Bot.

[~gvvinblade], please review the patch. TC looks good.

[~rkondakov] I have on comment for the patch. Is it important that only one key is used in tests? Can we use different keys in order to avoid possible write conflicts? It will allow us to keep test without code needed for MVCC only.

[~Pavlukhin], yes, we can use different keys in this test, but checking the result for the only one key is much simpler than for multiple keys. So we have to choose between two cases: complex update closures or complex results check. I've chosen a complex closure solution.

[~rkondakov] well if result check becomes complex then it might not be a good idea. Perhaps we still can make an improvement. I noticed that retry for MVCC operations was already employed in number of places. May be we can extract _operation with retry_ into common place?
Anyway it looks like that patch fixes the issue and can be merged. 

[~rkondakov], [~Pavlukhin], merged to master. Thanks for the contribution and the review.
