Seen here on trunk too: [https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1654/testReport/junit/dtest-offheap.cqlsh_tests.test_cqlsh_copy/TestCqlshCopy/test_bulk_round_trip_with_timeouts/]

So far the good news is that I can reproduce this in a clean environment on 4.0, 4.1 and trunk.

This also reproduces against 3.0 and 3.11.  Honestly, I'm not sure this test ever passed without being flaky since the cqlsh returns are not being checked and 100-200ms timeouts are pretty aggressive.

Given that this is not a new regression for 5.0 I'm going to stop working on it for now.  Here are my notes:

The [returns from cqlsh|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/trunk/cqlsh_tests/test_cqlsh_copy.py#L2422] are collected but never inspected.  The number of records reported in the log after this is just [regurgitated|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/trunk/cqlsh_tests/test_cqlsh_copy.py#L2423] from the original insert, so it can easily be incorrect.  It is ignored errors here that result in the math being broken for the assertion later.  This can affect all versions of the _bulk_round_trip_ tests.

The _with_timeouts_ version specifically also has the issue of relying on small read/write request timeout settings to force timeouts to occur, which will obviously be very sensitive to the environment the test is run in.
