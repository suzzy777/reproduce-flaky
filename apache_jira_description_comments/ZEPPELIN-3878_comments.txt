    [ZEPPELIN-3311] Zeppelin should ask user to re-login after JWT cookie expires (KnoxJwtRealm)
    
    Zeppelin should ask user to re-login after JWT cookie expires.
    
    [Bug Fix]
    
    * [ZEPPELIN-3311](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3311)
    
    Steps to reproduce :
    1) Enable SSO for zeppelin
    2) Login to zeppelin using SSO.
    3) Now wait till JWT expires(knoxsso.token.ttl under Advanced knoxsso-topology could be set to lower values to get a short lived cookie)
    4) Refresh zeppelin. Zeppelin doesn't ask for re-login, though JWT is already expired and not valid anymore.

    [ZEPPELIN-3377] Passing Z variables to JDBC interpreter
    
    ### What is this PR for?
    This PR enables the interpolation of ZeppelinContext objects into the paragraph text of JDBC cells. It also introduces a new interpreter-level configuration parameter named _zeppelin.jdbc.interpolation_. This new parameter is _false_ by default, and must be set to _true_ to enable object interpolation. The default value of _false_ guarantees backward compatibility for users who are not aware of the new feature.
    
    The implementation takes the same approach that was followed in [PR-2898](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2898).
    
    I have also taken the liberty to correct a preexisting error in the description of the use of Dynamic Forms in the associated documentation (_jdbc.md_).
    
    ### What type of PR is it?

    ### What is the Jira issue?
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3377
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    CI Pass.
    
    The code in this PR merely causes the JDBC interpreter to "opt-in" to the implementation already existing in the `Interpreter` base class - described in [PR-2898](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2898). The unit tests necessary are already present in PR-2898
    
    ### Screenshots (if appropriate)
    
    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update? No
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? No
    * Does this needs documentation? Yes, documentation has been added to the file _jdbc.md_. I have also taken the liberty to correct a preexisting error in the description of the use of Dynamic Forms in the associated documentation.

    ZEPPELIN-3412 Enable query prefix syntax in bigquery interpreter
    
    ### What is this PR for?
    - interpreter
    Enable query prefix syntax in bigquery interpreter.
    Bigquery has a convenient query prefix syntax #standardSQL and #legacySQL.
    This enable to switch between standardSQL and legacySQL without changing UseLegacySql option.
    Currently (v0.8.0 or later), bigquery interpreter definitely runs with UseLegacySql option.
    As described in the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/enabling-standard-sql?hl=en#sql-prefix), when this option is set to true or false, the query prefix cannot be used.
    
    - documentation
    Removed some contents from README.md. They are duplicated with interpreter documentation.
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    Improvement
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3412
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    - Unit test should pass
    
    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update? No
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? No
    * Does this needs documentation? Yes

    [Zeppelin 3388] Refactor documentation for ZeppelinContext
    
    ### What is this PR for?
    This PR is a refactoring of the `ZepplinContext` documentation.
    
    The description of `ZepplinContext` is now almost entirely contained within the _Spark_ interpreter's documentation ([spark.md](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/interpreter/spark.md)). But `ZepplinContext` has many generic features that are available to all interpreters, and it is important for `ZepplinContext` to have a more visible and independent presence in the Zeppelin documentation.

    Unfortunately, not. I don't have much time to check this issue. Can you build it on your local machine by cleaning all of maven local repositories like `rm -rf ~/.m2`?
