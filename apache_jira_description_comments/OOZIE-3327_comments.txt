[~kmarton] if you have a chance, can you please look into this? Thanks!

Yes, I will assign it to me.

It seems to be some dependency issue between the tests or some other patch fixed this issue indirectly, because I've run only this test class 500 times without failures.

I've run the tests in the same order as when it failed, but it passed locally.

I have followed the precommit results and it seems that this test case is not flaky anymore, so I will close this issue. Feel free to reopen it, if you seeÂ TestConcurrentCopyFromLocal failing.
