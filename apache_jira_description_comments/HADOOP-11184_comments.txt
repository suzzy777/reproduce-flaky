This patch updates lz4 to r123.

The only code change that had to be made is that the deprecated function name {{LZ4_uncompress}} has been removed; that function is now called {{LZ4_decompress_fast}}.  So I changed it in {{Lz4Codec.cc}} and {{TestCompressions.cc}}.

Thank you for doing this, Colin.  It looks good.

I verified that this is the same code as the published r123 version.  I built successfully and ran {{TestLz4CompressorDecompressor}} on Mac, Linux and Windows.  The new version cleans up some compilation warnings that we had been seeing with the prior version.

I ran the MR native task tests too.  I think I'm seeing some flakiness in those tests, but it's nothing related to this patch.

Can we also delete lz4_encoder.h please?  It appears r123 no longer uses that header.

One more very minor note: this probably ought to be a HADOOP jira instead of HDFS.

bq. Can we also delete lz4_encoder.h please? It appears r123 no longer uses that header.

removed

Sorry I didn't catch this earlier, but it looks like our LICENSE.txt file includes a copy-paste of the LZ4 license.  The text of the LZ4 license has a minor change to set the copyright year to 2014 and include a hyperlink to their public forum.  Let's update our LICENSE.txt to match the text from lz4.h.  (I discovered this in a grep, because LICENSE.txt also mentions some of the old files like lz4_encoder.h.)

While at it, maybe it could be a good idea to consider using LZ4_decompress_safe instead of LZ4_decompress_fast ?

LZ4_decompress_safe guarantees protection against deliberately modified (malicious) input, 
while LZ4_decompress_fast only guarantees decoding of properly formed compressed input.

But since prototypes are different, it may not be a "simple" upgrade,
and in such a case, maybe it would deserve a different issue tracking number.


Thank you for the information, Bert.  I'd agree with keeping the scope here limited to just a straight code upgrade, and improvements in the way we use LZ4 could be deferred to separate issues.  Do you want to file a new issue with the information that you described?

Update LICENSE.txt

+1 for filing a new issue to use decompress_safe

There is one more small change in the license information about how to contact the author.  This is what I see in the r123 version of lz4.h:
{code}
   You can contact the author at :
   - LZ4 source repository : http://code.google.com/p/lz4/
   - LZ4 public forum : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lz4c
{code}

It looks like a change related to tracing accidentally snuck into this patch file.

I'll be +1 after those 2 changes.  Thanks, Colin.

Thanks, Chris.  You have good eyes

+1 for patch v4 pending Jenkins.  Thanks very much for taking care of this, Colin.
