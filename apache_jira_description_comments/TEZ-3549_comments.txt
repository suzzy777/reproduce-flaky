[~kshukla], the TestFaultTolerance may be related as it relates to no progress. Can you comment on this test case and possibly post a new patch?

Thanks [~jeagles]. Updated patch to address the test failure. Due to this bug, the test was not really testing what it expected. The test-vertex's sleep value for the processor was not getting set properly and the fix started exercising code correctly causing failures. Request for review and comments post Precommit. Thanks a lot!
