Possibly related to CASSANDRA-17307 though the error on the two failures differs. 

Seen three times these days according to butler on trunk so I guess it deserved not to be in triage :) 

Possible duplicate of CASSANDRA-17307

Edit: Yeah ok what Josh said lol

Indeed this seems a duplicate of CASSANDRA-17307, hitting the same type of timeout in a different test case. And, same as CASSANDRA-17307, the test also frequently hits the failure reported on CASSANDRA-17641, CASSANDRA-17642, CASSANDRA-17651 and CASSANDRA-17652. That {{ShutdownException}} reported on the other tickets is far more common than the timeout, so it seems difficult to solve the timeout without fixing the {{ShutdownException}} bug before.

[~adelapena] would you agree to close optimistically now that CASSANDRA-17636 is merged?

There is more to the failures than just CASSANDRA-17636, but all the issues should be addressed at CASSANDRA-17307. I think we can close this as a duplicate of CASSANDRA-17307.

Having started the review of CASSANDRA-17307 I agree they are the same root cause and this one is a dup.
