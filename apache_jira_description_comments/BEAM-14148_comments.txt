Started rollback of https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17035 in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17154

On mac it fails for me with the following after running for few minutes.

$ ./gradlew :sdks:java:extensions:python:build

Above was in a virtualenv.

Outside a virtualenv it fails faster.

chamikara-macbookpro3:beam chamikara$ ./gradlew :sdks:java:extensions:python:build

Is the action here to diagnose the flake and roll forward?

[~bhulette] I think so.
