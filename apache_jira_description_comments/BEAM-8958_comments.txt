Current IO modules with AWS client providers using access key/secret rather than a configurable credentials provider:
 * aws (sdk v1)
 ** dynamodb
 ** sns
 * kinesis (sdk v1)
 ** though AWSModule for serialization not available
 * aws (sdk v2)
 ** kinesis

[~aromanenko] I suppose this ticket meant the v2 module? Does it make sense to expand the scope of this to tackle the other cases? The only "problematic" candidate seems to be kinesis v1 ...

 

Also, should the old API be deprecated?

Well, it would be great to add this for two versions of KinesisIO, I guess it should be pretty similar, iirc. 

Perhaps, we need to re-think the design of this since there are two basic ways of authentication for AWS services now in Beam - with {{AwsModule}} (Jackson module) for S3 and with own implementation of {{AwsClientsProvider}} for every AWS IO connector that Beam supports. Imo, it would be great to have a one unified way of authentication for all of them (for SDK v1 and v2 separately, of course). In this case, we will need to deprecate an old API for sure.

Btw, SDK v1 connectors are supposed to be deprecated and removed in the feature but we need to make sure that SDK v2  connectors support everything that v1 modules support.



i've previously ignored the S3Options / AwsOptions as it rather looked like the outlier. But I agree, it would dramatically cut down config boilerplate in case there's multiple AWS IO connectors present.  I'll read a bit more about pipeline options and ping you then.

Kinesis (for SDK v1) is currently a separate module. So that would require copying the code required for serialization of the CredentialsProvider there as well. Apart from that not a big deal ...

 

 

Unifying AWS IO APIs on using pipeline options would require further discussions upfront as it is a bigger change and out of scope for this ticket.

Resolution here is to support AWS credential providers for Kinesis IOs on SDK v1 and v2.
