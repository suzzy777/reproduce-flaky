0.99.0 comes with dist log replay by default (HBASE-10888). However, reading the code and discussing this with Jeffrey, we realized that the dist log replay code is not compatible with rolling upgrades from 0.98.0 and 1.0.0.

The issue is that, the region server looks at it own configuration to decide whether the region should be opened in replay mode or not. The open region RPC does not contain that info. So if dist log replay is enabled on master, the master will assign the region and schedule replay tasks. If the region is opened in a RS that does not have this conf enabled, then it will happily open the region in normal mode (not replay mode) causing possible (transient) data loss.
