I was able to run all the upgrade tests without failures using

{code}UPGRADE_TO="2.2.2" JDK_VERSION=1.8_60 NUM_TOKENS=32 SKIP=FALSE PRINT_DEBUG=true nosetests upgrade_tests -x -s -v --with-flaky --verbosity=3 --with-xunit --nocapture 2>&1 | tee -a test_stdout.txt{code}

The output is attached.

Environment variables were
{code}
UPGRADE_TO=binary:2.2.2
CASSANDRA_DIR=/home/aweisberg/cassandra
JDK_VERSION=1.8.60
CASSANDRA_VERSION=git:cassandra-2.1
{code}

I'll hit the tests that are failing in cassci a little harder to see if I can get them to fail.

{{upgrade_tests/paging_test.py:TestPagingWithDeletions.test_failure_threshold_deletions}} is broken by a change in the exceptions thrown by the python driver for timeouts (or possibly it was always wrong). Need to check for OperationTimedOut as well.

I don't think {{upgrade_tests/cql_tests.py:TestCQL.large_count_test}} is flapping anymore looking at recent test history.

This [pull request|https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/642] fixes the issue with TestPagingWithDeletions which is caused by the driver throwing an exception for timeouts that is not expected. The test does expect there to be a time out.

Turns out this is still a test bug, but different from what I thought. The server isn't timing our requests as fast as expected because the configuration is wrong.

What I found is that the timeouts for each read request is 10 seconds instead of the requested one second. This means that with six attempts it hits the driver's 60 second timeout some of the time.

I set request_timeout_in_ms and range_request_timeout_in_ms and now it seems to run through the timeouts in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 quickly.

I updated the pull request.
