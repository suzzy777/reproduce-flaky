attach a patch for adding stats for bookie server.

The patch looks good, I just have a couple of comments:

# I'm not sure what's going on with the use of NullStatsLogger in some constructors. That means that we won't be collecting stats for those classes, no? What am I missing?
# I've tried to run the tests a number of times and it fails for me every time, but a different test case. It doesn't like this patch is causing it, so the tests might be a bit unstable with the recent changes. Are you observing the same?

{code}
I'm not sure what's going on with the use of NullStatsLogger in some constructors.
{code}

The constructors with NullStatsLogger.INSTANCE are mostly for test cases. So I don't need to check a lot of places in test cases due to constructor signature changes. The server will construct with a StatsLogger instantiated by StatsProvider (see #main function in BookieServer).

but a different test case. It doesn't like this patch is causing it, so the tests might be a bit unstable with the recent changes

what test cases you observed? is it ReadOnlyBookieTest : BOOKKEEPER-774 ? or MultipleThread**Test?

Here is one:

testMetadataConflictWithRecovery[0](org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BookieRecoveryTest): Not fully replicated

and another:

{noformat}
Failed tests:   test10Ledgers200ThreadsRead(org.apache.bookkeeper.test.MultipleThreadReadTest): Test failed because we couldn't read entries
{noformat}

[~fpj] these two are pretty flaky test cases. we had an improvement on MultipleThreadReadTest, which might address it.
