Support auto plotting / charting of materialized data of a given PCollection with Interactive Beam.

Say an Interactive Beam pipeline defined as

 
{code:java}
p = beam.Pipeline(InteractiveRunner())
pcoll = p | 'Transform' >> transform()
pcoll2 = ...
pcoll3 = ...{code}
The use can call a single function and get auto-magical charting of the data.

e.g.,
{code:java}
show(pcoll, pcoll2)
{code}
Throughout the process, a pipeline fragment is built to include only transforms necessary to produce the desired pcolls (pcoll and pcoll2) and execute that fragment.

This makes the Interactive Beam user flow data-centric.
