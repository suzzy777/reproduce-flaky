This is interesting I have been running zookeeper with kerberos as soon as java9 was released and I had never seen this problem.

 

Would you like to send a PR?

I have seen this exception already with ZK 3.5.5 on java 11.
The TGT renewal thread seems to retry the TGT renewal a few times (waiting 10 seconds between retries). I'm not exactly sure what will happen after the TGT renewal thread finally exit? (maybe the client will start a new Login? Or this had to be done by the application or e.g. curator?)

Anyway, the problem seems valid, and the patch applied by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12730 seems reasonable and safe. I'll prepare a fix for this. I think the same problem appears even on master branch in ZooKeeper.

[~vgrivel] please let me know if you are already working on the patch, otherwise I'll create one soon.

bq. I had never seen this problem.

I heard someone reproduced this by decreasing TGT expiration time during tests. But I guess other kerberos problem (KDC overload, temporary network problems, etc) can trigger this also in normal production systems.

[~symat] I'm not working on a patch so I will let you do it if it is good. 
We start seeing this issue by doing an extensive test of KDC failures and resiliency of Kafka. For that we simulate KDC failure while decreasing the TGT validity to few minutes. 

Linked to that issue, we also raised a JDK enhancement request: [https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8282223] as currently only a SocketTimeoutException trigger the retry mechanism to connect to the KDC.
