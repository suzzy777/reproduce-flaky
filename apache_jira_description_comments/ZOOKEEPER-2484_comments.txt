We are sharing a static port number over multiple tests, and this is problematic because if one test failed and not got cleaned up properly, then there will be a cascading failure of the remaining tests that depends on the same port number. This patch changes the scope of the port number so each test case has their own specific port number when the test is executed. In case a port number assigned to a test case is occupied, the test case will rely on the existing resilient logic in PortAssignment.unique to retry a different port, which improved the overall stability of the tests.

Failed test is related to ZOOKEEPER-2080 - I had a patch there to fix that issue.

[~hanm] - can you update this patch? It's a good submission, however it's no longer applying to the heads of the branches (conflicts).

Update patch so it applies to trunk.
