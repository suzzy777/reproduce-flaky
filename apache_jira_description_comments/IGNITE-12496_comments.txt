Should we merge this issue to 2.8 release branch also?

[~mmuzaf]Â it would be nice. I am going to complete this fix soon.

Thin connection SSL problems are not related to my fix.

 Changes look good to me. [~agoncharuk] can you help with merge, please.

Thanks, merged to master.
[~mmuzaf] please cherry-pick the change to 2.8 if necessary and it does not push the release date further.
