Occasionally, the majority of this class's tests will fail due to being unable to start the cluster.  Such a failure is beyond the scope of the test and should be reported quickly.

This class should be divided into two classes, one containing those tests that require the cluster's server to be running and one that does not.  The cluster start-up in both cases should be delegated to a {{@BeforeClass}} method so that failure occurs as the class level and is quickly recognizable.
