+1 (taking away the unrelated commit)

Do you have a circleci run for this? 

Thanks, I left a few comments on the PR

I believe we also need 3.11, 4.0 and 4.1 branches. We normally start from the lowest and propagate up to trunk. 

I will make one more pass tomorrow morning to verify what you call in the jobs. The first review was focused on the more high-level stuff. As soon as those are in place the rest is easy.

+1 on pulling this in a separate ticket

PR for 3.11: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1953

The patch LGTM but there were numerous changes committed to CircleCI config lately, so I suggested to help rebase and regenerate the patches. The outcome can be found on [this commit|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commit/0386995747368d8da71ff963c1fdabc6b96d7236] 

I also pushed a CI run for 3.11 to verify I didn't make a mess [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2034/workflows/f78cfc58-8135-4edf-ad5f-072ec6f57b53], only the separate workflow jobs for now. I also verified the number of off heap tests run in [Jenkins|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-3.11-dtest-offheap/lastBuild/testReport/] and [CircleCI|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2034/workflows/f78cfc58-8135-4edf-ad5f-072ec6f57b53/jobs/16277/tests] was the same - 1077

[~dchenbecker] , [~adelapena] do you mind to verify this one and if it looks fine I will propagate it to the other branches and also make the JDK11 version of it in the newer branches? Thanks in advance. 

Actually, while pushing to CI I realized in the newer versions where we have split CQLSH DTests from the others as we run those with both Python2 and Python3 - we will need probably an offheap version for those? Also, if I look correctly it seems we run the CQLSH tests in 4.0 in Jenkins only with one Python version?

The patch for 3.11 looks good to me, I have left a couple of minor suggestions on the PR.

I took at look at the updated commit ([https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commit/0386995747368d8da71ff963c1fdabc6b96d7236)] and it looks correct to me. Andres' suggestions also look reasonable

Thank you both!

Feedback incorporated

[4.0|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commit/4e240587be247fb21808de890270e89b8848d27a], [CI #2042|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=17950-4.0]- I will rework the patches (which do not apply clean) now when we agree on the rest. I saw some inconsistencies in the names having both "_" and "-" in the names and I decided to fix this In a different commit or even maybe in a follow up ticket as otherwise things become extra noisy and super hard for review.

Seems like in Jenkins we run CQLSH tests only Python3? But as we still do have best effort Python2 not removed in 4.0, I kept the trend to have the Python2 jobs too.

[4.1|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commit/5e3b045f2afba3424efd4c86c28664b24905c06c], [CI #2045|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=17950-4.1] - we removed python 2 in 4.1. Otherwise it is the same as 4.0

Trunk will be the same as 4.1.

If those look ok I can work on midres and highres patches tomorrow.

Looks good to me, I think we can update the patches and run the other resource configs.

I'm afraid formatting has rendered this ilegible, is it "-" and "_", right? I'll be fine doing that in a separate ticket.

Also, you'll hate me for this, but can we rename the {{j8_cqlsh_dtests_offheap_py3}} jobs to {{{}j8_cqlsh_dtests_py3-offheap{}}}, so it's consistent with {{{}j8_cqlsh_dtests_py3_vnode{}}}, where we have first the Python version and then the config option? I'll be fine doing that in the followup ticket for homogenizing names.

Ops, you are right, that's what it had to be.

No, no hate :D I changed them three times last night... naming is hard. hehe I think what you suggested makes sense and it changes the new names so it doesn't add noise. I will do that now before the patches.

Thanks. Let's commit CASSANDRA-18024 and I will do them and add test runs. Thank you for the quick review.

Just pushed CI for all branches, only the separate jobs for now.

I will check the results tomorrow morning and I suggest we push 4.0/4.1 pre_commit but not all branches as that will be crazy amount of resources... 

That's looking good :)

I have tested the patches locally to see that the patches apply cleanly, the repeated jobs are removed on the absence on tests to be repeated, etc. All looks good to me to the extent that, as we know, it's a quite manual process. I hope not to have missed anything.

I see that on pre-commit offheap cqlsh dtests are optional, whereas regular and vnodes cqlsh dtests are mandatory, which is ok to me. However, it's a bit odd that on the separate workflows there is a separate approval step for offheap cqlsh dtests, whereas regular and vnodes cqlsh dtests are grouped together under a single approval step. I think we should probably have either a single approval step for all types of cqlsh dtests, or three separate approval steps for regular, vnodes and offheap cqlsh dtests. Since that would be just a very minor improvement we can do it in a separate ticket, and keep going with this as it is so we get to CI parity as soon as possible.

Thank you so much for doing that and for the quick review :)

I did it intentionally that way. My reasoning - we do not change the current setup but we also do not want the new ones to be mandatory as we haven't really seen them failing without the others failing. But I agree that we need a broader agreement on what will be mandatory and what not after we have all jobs presented, annual re-evaluation if you will :D 

So do I hear I have +1 to commit this one and move to the last ticket on the line? [~dchenbecker] ? [~mck] ?

Started [this 4.0 pre-commit |https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2057/workflows/6cca6ba0-8e84-4f99-a989-4285089994b4] for a sanity check while waiting for go/no go :-)

bq. I did it intentionally that way.

Yes, yes, I'm happy with not making them mandatory on the pre-commit workflow. It's the buttons on the separate workflows what I think we could rearrange, having either a single approval step for all types of cqlsh dtests, or three separate approval steps for regular, vnodes and offheap cqlsh dtests. That's just a small improvement and we can do it separately, maybe in that followup ticket for homogenizing names. But we have a lot of more pressing things to do before.

bq. So do I hear I have +1 to commit this one and move to the last ticket on the line? Derek Chen-Becker ? Michael Semb Wever ?

+1 from me.


4.0 finished fully green, I also verified the amount of offheap tests being run to be the one we also see in Jenkins :)

I was actually talking about both separate and pre-commit workflows :D Anyway, let's juggle those when we have 4.1 out, agreed. And thanks :)

Thanks, preparing branches, starting commit soon

There is something wrong with trunk while preparing the whole merge fun...looking now into it

Figured it out, trunk was rebased one patch earlier than it should have been last night...

The repeat_jobs were still there with the previous patch.

Pushing CI here for trunk:

LGTM, I will still leave it for the others to double-check it until tomorrow.

In the meantime the other branches were confirmed so I will cherry-pick them and rebase the other ticket on top. So this is "almost" not a blocker to finish these works. 

Trunk patch LGTM

Looks good to me.

It seems that you approved the dtests jobs but forgot to approve the build [in the MIDRES/trunk/java8_separate_tests variation|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2067/workflows/fb13d3f9-5315-4679-a5cd-c8f20cc59f7f]. Given that those tests have been run with j11/MIDRES and j8/j11/HIGHRES, I don't think that run is going to make a difference.
