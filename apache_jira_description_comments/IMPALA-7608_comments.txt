IMPALA-7608: Estimate row count from file size when no stats available

Added the feature that computes an estimated number of rows in the current
hdfs table if the statistics for the cardinality of the current hdfs table is not
available.

Also added an additional query option to revert the change in case of regression.

Testing:
(1) In CardinalityTest.java, replaced the original statement
"verifyCardinality("SELECT a FROM functional.tinytable", -1);" in
the method testBasicsWithoutStats() with
"verifyCardinality("SELECT a FROM functional.tinytable", 2);".
(2) In CarginalityTest.java, added more tests to check the cardinality
of most PlanNode implementations. For each tested PlanNode, the behaviors
before and after we disable the feature are both tested.
(3) In set.test, modified three related test cases to make sure that
the added query option is included after executing "set all" in various
scenarios.
(4) There are 8 JUnit tests in PlannerTest.java that would produce different
distributed query plans when this feature is enabled. Added an additional
JUnit test for 6 of those 8 affected JUnit tests when this feature is
enabled. Specifically, each tested query in a newly added test files involves
at least one hdfs table without available statistics.
We do not add test cases for 2 of the affected JUnit tests when this feature
is enabled since it results in flaky tests. These two JUnit tests are
testResourceRequirements() and testSpillableBufferSizing(). In this patch
we only test them when the feature is disabled.
(5) There are 5 Python end to end tests that consist of queries that would
produce different results. Added an additional query for each affected query
when this feature is disabled.

IMPALA-8698: Disable row count estimate to avoid a flaky test

Disabled the row count estimate for an hdfs table for the EE test
test_bloom_filters to avoid a flaky test due to a previous patchset
(IMPALA-7608).

Testing:
Have run the revised EE test on a local dev box.

IMPALA-8702: Remove the PlannerTestOption of VALIDATE_CARDINALITY to avoid a flaky test

Removed the PlannerTestOption of VALIDATE_CARDINALITY in testJoins()
and testFkPkJoinDetection() to avoid checking the estimated cardinality which
may be slightly different each time due to IMPALA-7608 when an hdfs table
without stats is involved in a query.
