Not sure why yet, but we are seeing the case when cluster is in overall a bad state, where after RS dies and deletes its znode, the notification looks like it's lost, so the master doesn't detect the failure. ZK itself appears to be healthy and doesn't report anything special.
After some other change is made to the server list, master rescans the list and picks up the stale change. Might make sense to add a config that would trigger the refresh if it hasn't happened for a while (e.g. 1 minute).
