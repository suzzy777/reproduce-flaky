[~apurtell] Will take a look.

[~apurtell] I ran this test many times (atleast 10 times) on branch-2.4 and it always succeeds. Do you have any failing build where I can look ?

[~shahrs87] I pasted the relevant stacktrace on this issue. This test flakes when the unit test suite is run on an Amazon EC2 x64 M5 class instance. Java 8. If you cannot reproduce you should still be able to deduce from the failed assert what happened. Why did the assert fail? 

Just assigned HBASE-25823 to myself, will come up with patch soon. Thanks

Moved to 2.4.15.
