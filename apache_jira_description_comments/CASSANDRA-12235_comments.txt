There isn't really much useful in the logs, other than the fact that node2 died about ten minutes before the test ended. Gc.log and debug.log don't really show a cause of death. I have to assume the oom killer? 

Basically rf=1 tests were flaky for non-vnodes because depending where the new node was bootstrapped, the consistent bootstrap could succeed or not (depending if the node would take or not the range of the down node). The fix is to use deterministic tokens for the non-vnode case.
