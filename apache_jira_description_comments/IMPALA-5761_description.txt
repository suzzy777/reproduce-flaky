There was a random failure in one of our builds of the TestRowsAvailability test.

Here's what the error looks like:
{code}
 TestRowsAvailability.test_rows_availability[query: select * from functional.alltypestiny where month = 1 and bool_col = sleep(1000) | exec_option: {'batch_size': 0, 'num_nodes': 0, 'disable_codegen_rows_threshold': 0, 'disable_codegen': False, 'abort_on_error': 1, 'exec_single_node_rows_threshold': 0} | table_format: text/none]
