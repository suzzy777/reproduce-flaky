[~vitalii] What is the status of this issue?  It would be really nice to have CI working properly.  Thanks!

[~cgivre] You can monitor the current status of the [branch|https://github.com/vdiravka/drill/commits/DRILL-7973]. I performed separate CI build run for every change to make sure it enhances the successful builds probability.

I am going to open PR soon.

It will include the following improvements:
 * added _fail-fast: false_ fot the CI to avoid build failures once other build is failed:

 [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61070925/github-actions-disable-auto-cancel-when-job-fails]

 [https://github.community/t/why-a-matrix-step-will-be-canceled-if-another-one-failed/16184]
* Clean memory for the container running:
 [https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/1918]
 * Fix for Cassandra connection timeout in scope of Test Container
 * Update Maven Version _3.6.3_ -> _3.8.1_
 * Update _actions/cache@v1 -> actions/cache@v2_
 * Decrease Heap size for CI builds _-DmemoryMb=1600_
 * Add info how to enable github Debug logging:
 [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/enabling-debug-logging]
 [https://github.community/t/ci-access-to-shell-session/17250]
 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-20945

Two more things:
* TestHttpPlugin#testSlowResponse failed. Added fix for this test case:
_new MockResponse().setResponseCode(200).throttleBody(64, 4, TimeUnit.SECONDS)_ -> 
_new MockResponse().setResponseCode(200)__.throttleBody(64, 6, TimeUnit.SECONDS)_
* Found that _TestDrillbitResilience_ is very often hung. Added timeout test execution 

* _TestDrillbitResilience_ is migrated to JUnit5. Some ignored tests are enabled. The bug with in "_@AfterEach_" method  with resource releasing is fixed.

   The GitHub CI is not running for this PR because I used up it for testing purposes and achieve the limit.

   Let's move it from draft, once GitHub CI is available again.

Review comment:
       @vdiravka 
   Thanks for the PR.  For this test, we could also set the timeout for the plugin config to be say 1 seconds and set the throttle to be 2.  Just a suggestion.  The goal with this test was just to make sure the plugin does in fact time out and throw the appropriate exception.

Review comment:
       I made this [change](https://github.com/vdiravka/drill/commit/55e5731270fa87b86a3a3c493ae3c969614568be#diff-c6b42ccd4a5372e7c299b3b8052455c0fe618403a957e0b1b908edf46eee4809R151), but then test sometimes can fail:
   ```

   So looks like this functionality works not precisely. I will check whether it can be improved or it is allowable error (~2-3sec)

Review comment:
       @vdiravka, I was just making a suggestion there.  Feel free to modify whatever you need to in order to get the CI to work consistently.  I also do concur with @dzamo that we should increase the timeout from 100m if we can because it seems like tests will randomly timeout.

Review comment:
       @cgivre, if tests are timed out, it is because they hang, not because the timeout is low. Usually, tests are completed in 60 min.

   @vdiravka I do still get the sense that moving our 100-minute limit to e.g. 120 minutes might help.  If you look at PR #2328, one build succeeded after 95 minutes while two timed out at 100 minutes.

   @dzamo With my latest changes the longest build is 1h 16m 37s = 77m. I think 100m is enough. 
   We can disable this timeout at all, but it is an indicator that something broken, if tests run longer.

   I will submit several additional build to make sure tests always pass in 80minutes.
