DynamicBrokerReconfiguration test creates __consumer_offsets topic with the default of 50 partitions. From the exception it looks like the test failed to create the topic and propagate metadata within the 15 second timeout. This is in the test setup, so no other timing issues here, just a slow test machine. I am changing the number of offset partitions to the value used in other tests, which is 5. Change is included in the PR for KAFKA-7976 (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6374).

Updating fixed version from 2.2.1 to 2.2.0 because we cut a new RC.
