After HBASE-15896, the flaky tests lists will also contain timed out (hanging) tests. Next few steps are:
- Hanging tests make the builds run for longer. I'll analyze the hanging tests and assign more meaningful timeouts to them so that they fail fast. This should reduce runtime of HBase-Flaky-Tests and will allow us to run it more frequently (currently runs every hour).
- Build dashboard to see flaky tests and various stats
- Run all flaky tests in pre-commit, but donâ€™t fail the build if these tests fail. (if yetus allows setting it up)

Log:
IT tests started showing up in flaky lists. That's weird because they don't run as part of trunk_matrix job which is the only source of adding new tests to flaky list. Note that Flaky-Tests job only runs the tests which are already in the flaky list.
Or at least, it was supposed to do so but it wasn't, since {{mvn install -Dtest=....}} always triggers it-tests irrespective of what's specified in -Dtest. Fix was changing mvn install to mvn test.
