Test fails with various exception, I see several issues:
1) Atomic structure is accessed during a node stop, which leads to NodeStoppingException (should be ignored)
2) Same race which leads to IllegalStateException: node is stopped
3) Invalid atomic integer increment which rarely leads to "Ignite instance with the same name has already been started" exception
