The change is in the ccm repo. Dtest repro just points to the new cmm and cassandra repro just points to the new dtests repro.

Testing involved raising at least 2 nodes + a 3rd one so it was unnecessarily heavy. Testing for this ticket will be added in CASSANDRA-16296 where we already need such a cluster for the sake QA speed.

CI:
 - ci-cass: [dtests|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/all/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/349/] + the splits where docker failed [here|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/350/]. cqlsh-dtests [here|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/all/job/Cassandra-devbranch-cqlsh-tests/486/]
- circle: [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/200/workflows/163604d7-5789-4ecd-bc38-655a5dee4f83] & [j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/200/workflows/51b54945-5ba5-416b-8e3b-69a77403baa2]. Lots of failures on github clone failures but still dtests and unit tests did run. The only failing dtest on consistency passes locally after looping 50 times. The other failures are known offenders.

I believe we already got a consensus on this solution.

Do we need CI run with older Cassandra versions?

Yep [~e.dimitrova] we did that on the PR :-)

Thanks [~Bereng], I found the links.

I saw only one new commitlog related test failure on trunk but it is also failing with other unrelated patches in dev, also it seems it has nothing in common with this one.

+1 from me, thank you

I _think_ this is +1 from [~e.dimitrova] and [~adelapena] so we can move to commit? Please correct me if I am wrong.

+1 from me, but of course not required ;)

+1 from me too

[~tomasz.lasica] your +1 is required as you made a review and provided a valuable input. Thank you for doing it! 

[~adelapena] do you have commit rights for the ccm repo? I don't think I have, I will try to contact service desk but that might take some time

[~e.dimitrova] I think I don't have permissions either. Also, the PR seems to be in need of rebase due to some little conflicts.

Rebased and squashed:

There are some failures, I can check them tomorrow morning

Agreed to every reviewer's +1 and thanks all for your work :-)

Failures 'look ok'. I think they are just flaky but I don't know for the <=2.2...

Indeed, CI results look fine to me, the regular flakiness plus one timeout in materialized_views test which seems unrelated and random. 

Starting commit soon

CCM patch committed [here|https://github.com/riptano/ccm/commit/e5870fd081a927b6d4bad47719b1b1f893d70c3e]. Retag done as per CASSANDRA-16383.
DTests patch committed [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/commit/ad9462ee737ebc92a86cb5b266fccdd93e1111a9]

Yes. Thx [~e.dimitrova], [~tomasz.lasica] and [~adelapena].

The nightly CI looks good. No weird dtest failures :-)

In the [latest|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/274/#showFailuresLink] ci-cass I see this message kicking in for a handful dtest-large tests. I'll get a PR ready but I am curious why neither circle or devBranch CI picked it... They don't seem to be ran there so there's little we could have done to catch that iiuc.

Reopening upon a handful of dtest-large failures that CI doesn't run. Tests can only be tested locally and fail/pass before/after the fix whic is pretty non-controversial imo. See [PR|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/pull/125]

Looking at the usages of that function, did you check the upgrade tests? I think they are also run on demand in Jenkins, right? 

I just pushed them in Jenkins [here |https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest-upgrade/35/]

They look ok to me but that was a another set of tests circle doesn't run so good you ran them :-)

+1 from me

Are we waiting on anything here for the commit? Asking as it would be good to clear these failures from the runs to reduce flakiness noise?

Coordinated with everyone, and committed remaining fix as [8762267b13fffb921ae79b0220630f10695ee9d9|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/commit/8762267b13fffb921ae79b0220630f10695ee9d9].

Thx all for the reviews and work here :-)
