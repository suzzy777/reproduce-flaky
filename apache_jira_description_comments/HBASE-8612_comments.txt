You have a fix Himanshu?  Should we revert hbase-8505?  I want my clean builds back! (smile)

this is more a flaky test than a always failing test..
the splitter and verifier are running in two different threads

Should we just disable it till fixed.  Just say NO to flakey tests!

Stack, I found this on 0.94.x build; reading 8505 it is known issue on this branch. Enis filed HBASE-8590 for 0.94.
I leave it on Lar's discretion whether this should be disabled till 8590 goes in.

This is a dup of HBASE-8590.

Agree. Sorry about that; let's close this.
