To me it seems as if the other end closed the connection. There can be a gazillion reasons why that happened. Why does it indicate a flaky build in your opinion?

TravisCI seems to fail during this step more often than it does when using the network for the setup steps ({{agt-get install}} in the Docker scripts). I think I have seen this three times in about 30-40 CI runs, which seems extremely high.

I suppose any build that uses the network is non-deterministic and so potentially flaky. This one seems especially so, perhaps to the extent it would be worth putting Dart in the {{.travis.yml}} list of flaky langauges: Haskell, Node.js, Python, and Perl.

CI has been stable in this area.
