Currently we are using the same zookeeper quorums for client and server, which makes us under risk that if some client connection boost exhausted zookeeper, RegionServer might abort due to zookeeper session loss. Actually we have suffered from this many times in production.

Here we propose to allow client to use different ZK quorums, through below settings:
{noformat}
hbase.client.zookeeper.quorum
hbase.client.zookeeper.property.clientPort
hbase.client.zookeeper.observer.mode
{noformat}

The first two are for specifying client zookeeper properties, and the third one indicating whether the client ZK nodes are in observer mode. If the client ZK are not observer nodes, HMaster will take responsibility to synchronize necessary meta information (such as meta location and master address, etc.) from server to client ZK
