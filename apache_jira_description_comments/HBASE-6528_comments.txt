[~lhofhansl] I don't know enough about the test infrastructure to comment on this.  Do you have any thoughts or know who would be the best person to look at this?

Patch looks fine. Just checked the test results, and this test has not failed in the past 20 odd runs.
@ShiXing: Did you see this failing somewhere specifically?


[~lhofhansl] this test case was introduced when I fix HBASE-6520 which does not have any relationship with TestSplitLogWorker#testAcquireTaskAtStartup.

I don't see any failing till now~

No harm waiting a little longer if it makes it so test will fail less often.

Integrated in HBase-TRUNK #3355 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/3355/])
    HBASE-6528 Raise the wait time for TestSplitLogWorker#testAcquireTaskAtStartup to reduce the failure probability (Revision 1387792)

     Result = FAILURE

Why was this not considered for 0.94?

I suppose that was my own fault :)  Looking at the comment I was well aware of this change.

Test is flaky for me on 0.94 Lars. See HBASE-7447, closed as dup of this issue.

I increased the timeout in HBASE-7455. Do you think more needs to be done?

No, I've tested with 100 repetitions after updating to latest 0.94 this morning and can no longer reproduce this problem. 

Marking closed.
