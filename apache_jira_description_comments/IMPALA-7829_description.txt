As shown in IMPALA-7828. there is some non-determinism on whether the errors detected in {{FragmentInstanceState::Close()}} will show up in the final profile sent to the coordinator. The reason is that the current code marks a fragment instance "done" after {{ExecInternal()}} completes but before {{Close()}} is called. There is a window in between when the final status report may be sent before {{Close()}} finishes. We should consider not sending the final report until {{Close()}} is done but we probably need to understand whether it has any implication to the overall reported query execution time. It should have no effect to the "First Rows Available" time for a query.
