This patch follows the pattern of other invoke calls catching and unwrapping InvocationTargetExceptions if they are of known types.  TestHBaseFsck::testQuarantineMissingHFile now passes against hadoop 2.0.  

Currently letting this bot run against 1.0, and having local run running against hadoop 2.0

Can someone take a look?  Otherwise, I'll commit over the weekend if there are no comments.

If cause is UndeclaredThrowableException, could cause.getCause() be null?
If so, it is better to move this before checking if cause is null; otherwise, it is fine with me.

+                  if (cause != null && cause instanceof UndeclaredThrowableException) {
+                    cause = cause.getCause();
+                  }
+                  if (cause == null){
+                    throw new RuntimeException(
+                      "Proxy invocation failed and getCause is null", e);
+                  }
