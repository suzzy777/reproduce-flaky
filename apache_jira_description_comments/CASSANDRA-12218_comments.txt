The problem is that there is only a single point in {{IndexSummaryRedistribution::redistributeSummaries}} which checks the flag to see if it should halt. On occasion, this point is passed before the stop is actually requested, the redistribution completes normally and no {{CompactionInterruptedException}} is thrown. 

With the linked branch, I haven't been able to repro the failure in over 150 runs (without it I couldn't get above ~50 iterations without a failure). 

The patch may seem quite large, but it's really just a refactoring. The significant change is an extension of {{IndexSummaryRedistribution}} that pauses until signaled before running. Only {{testCancelIndex}} makes use of this, all other tests are unchanged.
