The test checks that deleting a keyspace also deletes its metrics. I suspect that this failure is hitting a race introduced by CASSANDRA-17071, maybe around {{{}Schema#maybeRemoveKeyspaceInstance{}}}. Indeed, the test used to pass right before that commit ([j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1611/workflows/e2fe5f89-2ec9-4897-8f9a-07f467a874be] [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1611/workflows/59e81b6c-4506-400e-8370-77125536c87a]) and it started to be flaky right after that commit ([j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1610/workflows/9ba746fc-574b-4e81-8f9a-0af278b9277d] [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1610/workflows/2eb057c6-ef97-4682-a32c-d1fa1bc2cb2d]).

[Here|https://github.com/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/commit/e936f120b7ee1936bab6f62810a6d75af1bb7874] is the patch provided by [~jlewandowski], with [some repeated runs for 4.1 j8-j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/226/workflows/808cc7d1-03a0-4161-b56c-ca3d6477dfaf/jobs/1491]. I've started full CI for 4.1 and trunk:

The method {{Schema#clear()}} is only meant to be called by tests. Perhaps we should rename it to {{Schema#clearUnsafe()}} to prevent mistakes. This would be in line with methods such as {{ColumnFamilyStore#clearUnsafe()}}, {{Gossiper#clearUnsafe()}}, {{TokenMetadata#clearUnsafe()}} and {{Accumulator#clearUnsafe()}}.

[~jlewandowski] it seems that the repeated test runs above keep hitting the failure.

https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/226/workflows/808cc7d1-03a0-4161-b56c-ca3d6477dfaf/jobs/1491

[~jlewandowski] is that the original run with 1000 repetitions? My runs above have 5000 repetitions, all of them still hit the reported failure.

[~adelapena] which commit are you testing?

[This commit|https://github.com/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/commit/e936f120b7ee1936bab6f62810a6d75af1bb7874], applied to [4.1|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/7f7bfcb1f699214ac7178ae71f13d02ec71a87a3] and [trunk|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/ecc4f3c07e1d13216c0708ed705bfc8de0cb6923]. I've got that commit from [the last CI run above|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/226/workflows/808cc7d1-03a0-4161-b56c-ca3d6477dfaf/jobs/1491], is that the right one?

Triaging the 4.1 blockers board, moved to REVIEW IN PROGRESS this one to reflect it is already under review, I hope you don't mind. 

[~adelapena] I think I found the real issue, here is the test results (5000 repetitions): https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/228/workflows/b125e7b6-d9d5-4756-84ed-9d03cb3f7c47/jobs/1533/steps (/)

I'm running precommit now: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/228/workflows/41d28ecb-e3b5-49f4-a88b-b6aba84fa11b (!)



Unfortunately, there was another problem, rerunning precommit tests: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/230/workflows/aa77c841-d93b-4cc8-ae38-d79b73983384 (?)

[~jlewandowski] [this|https://github.com/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/commits/CASSANDRA-17658] is the branch containing the patch, isn't it? The CI links only point to a single commit, it might be useful to create a PR to be linked here.

[~adelapena] I'm not sure what do you mean - there is a PR https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1678


I wasn't aware of that PR. I have only seen the CI links on the ticket, and they only point to the last pushed commit. 

[~adelapena] my apologize for not being precise. What do you think about the latest patch version? The problem was that the keyspace got opened during removal. I think with the provided patch it is not longer possible.

No worries :). The fix looks good to me, I have left a couple of suggestions on the PR. I have applied the patch to trunk without conflicts and I'm running CI:
||Branch||CI||

CI hasn't finished yet with all the repeated test iterations, but the rest of the jobs have already finished and they look good to me. 

The failure of {{test_counter_node_down}} in 4.1 is due to the branch missing the fix for CASSANDRA-17411. The failure should go aways once it's rebased. The failure doesn't affect trunk because I have applied the proposed patch to a more recent version of the branch that includes CASSANDRA-17411.

As for the failures of {{test_prefer_local_reconnect_on_listen_address}} on trunk, it's a well-known bug reported on CASSANDRA-17700.

I've applied your comments and rebased. Now the tests are running: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/232/workflows/675c1235-9414-4c22-979e-5a3f07f5fc3c


[~adelapena] is it ok to merge?

The failure in [{{test_multiple_repair}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/232/workflows/675c1235-9414-4c22-979e-5a3f07f5fc3c/jobs/1599/tests] seems to be CASSANDRA-17005, whereas the failure in [{{testConnectionsAreRejectedWithInvalidConfig}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/232/workflows/675c1235-9414-4c22-979e-5a3f07f5fc3c/jobs/1593/tests] is CASSANDRA-17618.

The [repeated run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/232/workflows/675c1235-9414-4c22-979e-5a3f07f5fc3c/jobs/1611/tests] has hit a timeout that seems acceptable in so many runs.

However, [{{j11_dtests-no-vnodes}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/232/workflows/675c1235-9414-4c22-979e-5a3f07f5fc3c/jobs/1595/tests] has hit a lot of failures, which is probably due to an env issue. Probably we should run CI one last time after squash+rebase. We should also include the {{java11_pre-commit_tests}} workflow.

We should also prepare a patch for trunk and run CI for it, with both j8 and j11 workflows.

Aren't j11 pre-commit tests included in j8-precommit-tests?

I think that the problems with [{{j11_dtests-no-vnodes}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/232/workflows/675c1235-9414-4c22-979e-5a3f07f5fc3c/jobs/1595/tests] are due to low resources in CircleCI's config file. It seems that all the jobs except that one are using mid resources, but [{{j11_dtests-no-vnodes}} is still using low resources|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/f2068121c7507c79843a11c16efa290c3626d31c/.circleci/config.yml#L3266-L3272]. That's the only part of the config file that changes when I run:
{code:java}
.circleci/generate.sh -m \
  -e REPEATED_UTEST_TARGET=testsome \
  -e REPEATED_UTEST_COUNT=5000 \
  -e REPEATED_UTEST_CLASS=org.apache.cassandra.metrics.KeyspaceMetricsTest
{code}

{quote}Aren't j11 pre-commit tests included in j8-precommit-tests?
{quote}
They aren't, the j11 tests on the {{j8-precommit-tests}} workflow build cassandra with j8 and run the tests with both j8 and j11. The [{{j11-precommit-tests}} workflow|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/232/workflows/20ea8c6c-3d20-4d84-91f9-f3319ab18f87] uses j11 for both building and running. I am afraid we have to run both workflows to test all the j8-j8, j8-j11 and j11-j11 combinations.

I have run CI with the patch squashed, rebased, with [this remaining nit|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1678#discussion_r909498110], and also applied to trunk:

All looks good. However these runs don't include [this last nit|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1678/commits/32aba6148fadb2ca3d053213850c7fea69e51ebf]. [~jlewandowski] do we have full CI results for it?

For the record, it seems changing statuses marked me as a reviewer without being one.

If you need me to review it, I can do it next week, otherwise, please, feel free to remove me from the list of reviewers.

[~e.dimitrova] I've removed you as reviewer since it was accidental. However we'll need a second committer-reviewer for this, so it will be great if you have some time to take a look.

[~jlewandowski] Do you have a patch and CI runs for trunk?

As for [this remaining nit|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1678#discussion_r909498110], I can remove the unneeded annotation on commit.

Setting to Needs Committer and if no one picks it until Tuesday I will do it, thanks

Great, thanks. All the failed tests appear on Butler. Looks good to me, +1.

Overall LGTM and CI looks ok, I left a few small questions/comments in the 4.1 PR .

I saw a Jolokia issue again in the J11 runs and I noticed in the logs:

 
{code:java}
stdout = b"WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred\nWARNING: Illegal reflective access by org.jolokia.jvma...rt '8778' is already occupied.\nPlease check the standard output of the target process for a detailed error message.\n" stderr = None, retcode = 1 {code}
So that reminded me to check our version of Jolokia for dtests it seems we are on 1.6 and official support for Java 11 was added in 1.7 so I suspect we need to update the agent. I will open a separate ticket to tackle this problem, not related to the current ticket. 

 

Thanks, I've applied your suggestions on 4.1 branch and started CI https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/238/workflows/3ea0df08-d74d-4b74-bb56-ffdfa9daf147 (/)

Once ok, I'll add changes to trunk branch and run the rest of the tests

Latest changes seem reasonable to me and the CI looks quite green. +1 in case [~adelapena] does not having anything against those synchronizations of course

Looks good to me. Just in case, I have started some additional repeated runs of {{KeyspaceMetricsTest}} with the most recent changes, and also of the new test on {{{}SchemaTest{}}}:

All looks good, I think we are ready to commit. [~jlewandowski] I think you should be able to commit this yourself now that you are powerful committer. Please let me know if you need any help.

thank you [~adelapena], yes, I need some help, but I think I don't have an account yet :)

I think there is some information about the account [here|https://infra.apache.org/new-committers-guide.html#apache-committer-account-creation]. IIRC you have to upload you public key to [https://id.apache.org|https://id.apache.org/]. Then you can link the GitHub/GitBox accounts [here|https://git.apache.org/], so you can push to GitHub.

As for the commit process itself, there are examples [here|https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/how_to_commit.html].

I don't know if you have received the email notifying that the committer account has been created yet. If not, I can commit this for you in the meantime, or we can wait a bit until you have the account, as you prefer.

Hey [~jlewandowski] , did you try your commit rights? I don't think you will get any notification or anything, they are just assigned pretty quickly normally after you are told you are a committer already. Please let us know if you need any help. 

Note that, in the end, I have renamed the incorrect branch from CASSANDRA-17568-trunk to CASSANDRA-17658-trunk


It seems that the new {{SchemaTest.schemaReset}} is flaky, see CASSANDRA-17819.

IIRC that test survived 1000 repeated runs on the multiplexer the last time we run it for [4.1|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1910/workflows/2ce26187-7143-4c70-a825-1636b78ac63d] and [trunk|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1909/workflows/b47cb176-62de-40a1-9df5-6e6224080971], but that was almost one month before commit. Maybe something happened during the rebase?

The one ran in a loop indeed has the same name, but it is different class - the one tested was a unit test, the flaky one is in-jvm. I will push some runs now to see where it broke. Thanks for raising it!
