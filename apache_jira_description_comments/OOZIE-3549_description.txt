OOZIE-3157 removed {{oozie.https.truststore.pass}} property, because we (Oozie + Jetty) don't write the truststore and the password is not required for reading.

This is no longer true, Java 11's keytool now defaults to creating PKCS12 keystores instead of JKS, and according to [this|https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ca-certificates-java/+bug/1771363] bug description "A JKS keystore can be read without supplying a password (or by supplying an empty one) while a PKCS12 keystore requires a password to be set." 

We should reintroduce this property and allow the it again to specify this password and pass it to jetty.
