[~sravya] looks like the job logs are discarded, will watch for future failures. Could not find the failure in recent runs, is it still happening though?

Thanks for taking a look Ashish. I think I saw it a couple times in the past few weeks. Not very frequent, but some thing we need to fix to reduce flaky runs. I will post here if we encounter them again.

Yea, I could not reproduce it locally though, ran 10 time back to back all kafka tests. Will keep an eye for future failures.
