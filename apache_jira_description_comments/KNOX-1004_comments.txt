[~dionusos] - do you plan to contribute a patch for this?

[~lmccay], yes, I  would like to work on an acceptable fix.

Where exactly are the directories being deleted? You mentioned "cleanupSuite", but this is run with "@AfterClass" and so surely it should never run before the @After test method?

BTW a similar pattern is in GatewaySslFuncTest and AmbariServiceDefinitionTest tests, so if we are fixing this then those tests should be included in the patch.

[~coheigea] Thank you for your question. The directories I am talking about are on path ./gateway-test/target/gateway-home{$ID}/deployments/* . I understand @After and @AfterClass precedency. What I would like to explain (I think) is that during test cleanUp (@After) a Knox service is also deleting the same directories which causes an Exception in cleanUp method.

Also thank you for notifying me about similar patterns. I am going to fix them if the recommendation is acceptable.

Yes that's fine thanks, please fix the other tests as well and resubmit the patch.

Extended patch. Sorry for the delay.

The patch does not apply with the latest master - can you update your local repo and resubmit the patch please?

[~coheigea] I updated my local repo, checked out master, rebased and applied this patch without any conflict. Build and related tests are successful.

How are you applying the patch? With "git apply" I get:

git apply 0001-KNOX-1004-Failing-flaky-Knox-unit-test-org.apache.ha.patch
error: patch failed: gateway-test/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/gateway/GatewayAppFuncTest.java:103
error: gateway-test/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/gateway/GatewayAppFuncTest.java: patch does not apply

error: gateway-test/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/gateway/GatewaySslFuncTest.java: patch does not apply


I used the 'git apply {path/to/patch}' command exactly.

If you do "git log" on your repo, what is the last commit that you see?

    KNOX-1035 - Move JWTTokenTest to gateway-spi module + add more tests

As a sanity test, this is still failing for me. Does it work for you?

git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/knox.git
cd knox
wget https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12886354/0001-KNOX-1004-Failing-flaky-Knox-unit-test-org.apache.ha.patch
git apply 0001-KNOX-1004-Failing-flaky-Knox-unit-test-org.apache.ha.patch

Using the given steps I ran into the error. I recreated the changes in that new repository.  Build and tests are OK locally.
