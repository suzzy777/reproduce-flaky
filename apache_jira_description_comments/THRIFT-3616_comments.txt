Seen multiple times over the course of working THRIFT-3608

/cc [~nsuke] - I'm going to work this presently since I'm on a quest to get a green jenkins Thrift-precommit job, but I may turn it over to you since you're expert in this slice of the codebase if I have trouble making progress today.

OK - I have a delay-free way to fix this that also speeds up the test, just need to polish and I'll have a PR shortly.

Before: Ran 11 tests in 8.213s
After: Ran 11 tests in 0.284s

    Noting that Jenkins CI failed on lib/cpp/test/SecurityTest.cpp before getting to test_sslsocket.py.
    I have a fix for the SecurityTest in #848 that still needs review attention so I'll mark THRIFT-3616 as blocked on THRIFT-3608


committed

Just a small tips: include THRIFT-XXXX (3616 in this case) to your pull request title in the future, and everything there will be logged here too.

Ah yes, I misread 8 and 9 here: https://thrift.apache.org/docs/HowToContribute#contributing-via-github-pull-requests
Will do going forward.

Thanks [~nsuke]!
