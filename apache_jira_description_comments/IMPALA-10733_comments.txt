[~wzhou], while I was reviewing 4.1 blockers I found that this is slightly related to another issue I was investigating IMPALA-11187. I hope you don't mind I took the liberty and filed a CR:Â  [https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/18418/].

[~tmate]Thanks

IMPALA-10733: Fix flaky TestKuduOperations.test_replica_selection

This issue is related to IMPALA-11187, 'test_read_mode' can have
unpredicted results by its nature, it sets the 'kudu_read_mode' to
'READ_LATEST'. The 'test_replica_selection' runs just after
'test_read_mode' and the Kudu tests use the same Impala client, thus
'kudu_read_mode=READ_LATEST' persists.

This commit set 'kudu_read_mode=READ_AT_SNAPSHOT' for
'test_replica_selection'.

Testing:
 - Ran 'test_replica_selection'
