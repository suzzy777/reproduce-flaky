It has come to my attention that the cleanup() method in TestOzoneFileSystem (in CI integration (filesystem)), which is triggered after EACH test method is incredibly flaky.

However, when I add a call to wait for double buffer flush, it no longer seems flaky:

I suspect ofs/o3fs listStatus("/") is not correctly iterating cache. Otherwise it should be strongly consistent -- any file deletion should be immediately reflected to this or other clients.
