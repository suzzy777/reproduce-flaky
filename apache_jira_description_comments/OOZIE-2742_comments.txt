I put a patch in OOZIE-2720


Only when it is called from the Oozie server for kill, it should be ApplicationsRequestScope.ALL. Otherwise when it is called from the launcher AM (on retries) then it should be ApplicationsRequestScope.OWN. 

Actually we are going about it wrong. We need to do ugi.doAs in JavaActionExecutor.
