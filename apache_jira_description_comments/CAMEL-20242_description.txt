The default status for the camel-routes health checks [is UP|https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/camel-4.1.x/components/camel-microprofile/camel-microprofile-health/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/microprofile/health/CamelMicroProfileRepositoryHealthCheck.java#L53], and it is used if none of the routes is reporting DOWN.

When using the Supervising route controller, if the health check endpoint is called before the routes are started, the default status UP is reported.

This means that the application reports as Ready even before the routes were attempted to be started.

Even in scenarios where the route is certainly going to fail to startup, [like this one|https://github.com/rinaldodev/camel-playground/blob/7a30e964ba2ba233db347771d088b721cc331b82/src/main/java/com/github/lburgazzoli/MyRoutes.java],Â there is a brief period where the application reports as Ready.

This brief period is long enough for Camel K to occasionally report an Integration as Ready before it really is, which also makes [some tests flaky | https://github.com/apache/camel-k/issues/4922].

Possible solutions:
# Don't report UP as the default camel-routes status: if the routes health check is enabled and there are no routes reporting yet, should this really default to UP?
# Have a health check specifically check if the route controller is Ready: if routes weren't even attempted to be started, then the supervising route controller could report itself as DOWN.
