I thought about using Grafana alerting features to notify about flaky tests (no metrics for the last few days = something wrong is happening with the test and some action must be taken). Is that what you mean?

I do not know much about this particular test. We don't collect any metrics from it, that's for sure.

This issue is P2 but has been unassigned without any comment for 60 days so it has been labeled "stale-P2". If this issue is still affecting you, we care! Please comment and remove the label. Otherwise, in 14 days the issue will be moved to P3.

Please see https://beam.apache.org/contribute/jira-priorities/ for a detailed explanation of what these priorities mean.


This issue was marked "stale-P2" and has not received a public comment in 14 days. It is now automatically moved to P3. If you are still affected by it, you can comment and move it back to P2.

It seems like this test doesn't exist anymore, and isn't an issue currently. Resolving and if it actually still is an issue, we can reopen.
