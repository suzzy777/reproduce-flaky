Follow up of ZOOKEEPER-3988.

We should introduce a flag to disable the feature introduced by ZOOKEEPER-3682.

*Implementation*
 * Add new flagÂ netty.server.earlyDropSecureConnectionHandshakes to control the ZOOKEEPER-3682 feature.

 * Disable ZOOKEEPER-3682 by default, it is advanced feature, for very large clusters
 * Add docs
 * Add tests (also ZOOKEEPER-3682 missed tests, now we will have some)
