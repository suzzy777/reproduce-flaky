And as we will return a CompletableFuture, I think we can just remove the XXXAsync methods, and make all the methods blocking which means we will only finish the CompletableFuture when the operation is done. User can choose whether to wait on the returned CompletableFuture.

Convert this to a umbrella task. There maybe some sub-tasks.
1. Table admin operations.
2. Region admin operations.
3. Namespace admin operations.
4. Snapshot admin operations.
5. Replication admin operations.
6. Other operations, like quota, balance......
