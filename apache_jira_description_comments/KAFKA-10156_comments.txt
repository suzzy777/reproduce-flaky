Not sure if that's the right way to go to avoid flaky test behavior, but I propose to also check for {{closingChannel(id)}} state in this test as there is potentially a code path that could lead to such state. PR link with proposed change:Â [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9014].

Could please anyone have a look at it ([~ableegoldman]), and let me know your thoughts? I would like to continue on this one if chosen approach is considered to be okay or get some feedback on what else might be wrong.

Hey [~serj567], thanks for picking this up! I'm probably not the best person to give feedback here as I'm not that familiar with this specific test/code, I just happened to see it fail on some unrelated PRs. I'd suggest taking a look at the last person to touch on this test or the code it exercises and pinging them on the PR

Alright, thanks, I will ping the reviewers in PR.
