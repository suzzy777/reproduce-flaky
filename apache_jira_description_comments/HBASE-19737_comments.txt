The branch has been created. And also deleted the HBASE-19397 branch. [~appy] Will the nightly build job pick up this branch automatically?

No, it doesn't. One needs to click on "Scan multibranch pipeline now" for the job to rescan all branches and build new list.
Here's the job now: https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/HBASE-19397-branch-2.


To make it easier to prove impact on test stability, you might want to make a copy of https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests and https://builds.apache.org/job/HBASE-Flaky-Tests/. (these two are specifically for master branch)

Rebased.

Thanks [~appy]. Seems the branch-2.0 will be out soon so let's target this to 2.1.

[~appy] Branch HBASE-19397 has already been purged but it still shows up on the nightly job page. I can not find a way to remove it...

Rebased.

Rebased.

A successful nightly build.

Since branch-2.0 has been cut, is it the time to merge this branch to branch-2 now?

Thanks.

Merged to branch-2.
