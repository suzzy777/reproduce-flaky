    also, there are some test failures, could you take a look?

    @felixcheung The build seems to be very flaky. 
    In any case they're passing now https://travis-ci.org/chilang/zeppelin/builds/282217322, except for the web e2e tests in the build #2 (which are also failing on **master**)

    ok, agreed that seems unrelated.
    
    btw, it would be easier for reviewer to track changes if you do _not_ force push
    
    any comment on this PR? I'd wait for a couple of days.
