Increased wait time for specific task updates.

If a test launches a task that requires internet access, for example,
to download docker images, an initial status update might take some
time to arrive. To avoid flaky tests, we compensate for this by
increasing the wait timeout via `AWAIT_READY_FOR`. However, with the
introduction of `TASK_STARTING`, the first received message is not
`TASK_RUNNING` any more, hence we should use `AWAIT_READY_FOR` for
`TASK_STARTING` updates as well. Since an image can be downloaded for
either executor, or task, or both, we keep extended timeouts for both
status updates.
