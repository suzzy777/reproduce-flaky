I ran into this on one of my prs so I tried to take a quick look, but didn't get anywhere.  I didn't see anything obviously wrong in the test output, and I ran a few hundred times on my laptop and failed to reproduce.  one thing which might help is changing that assert slightly so we can actually see what the {{results}} are when it fails:

{code}
      val results = spark.read.table("noharness").collect().toSet
      assert(Set(0, 1, 2, 3).map(Row(_)).subsetOf(results), results)
{code}

Thank you for investigating this, [~irashid].

Somehow I found I filed duplicated issue SPARK-28247 for this, andÂ SPARK-28247 was resolved.

I've just marked it as duplicated, but please correct this if we prefer marking this as resolved.
