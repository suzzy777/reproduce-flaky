Currently, our test execution proceeds in the order of:

* backend tests
* frontend tests
* system, or end-to-end tests

If any of these logical stages produces a test failure, the Jenkins job should stop. However, we seem to continue to execute subsequent stages even when previous stages have failed. At the very least, we know that end-to-end tests run, even after BE tests have failed.

It's a basic tenet of software testing that if unit tests fail, those need to be triaged and fixed before any further testing can be done.
