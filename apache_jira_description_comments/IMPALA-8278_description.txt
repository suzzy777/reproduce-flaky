{{testEventProcessorFetchAfterHMSRestart}} test case in {{MetastoreEventsProcessorTest}} causes flakiness because it creates a new event processor pointing to the same the catalog instance. This means that all the events generated are now being processed by two events processor instances and they both try to modify the state of catalogd causing race conditions. The failures vary and depend a lot on the timing. I see the following exception which is related to this issue.

Easiest way to figure out if this is a problem is to look into FeSupport logs of the test to confirm if a event ID is being processed twice (i.e you see to exactly similar logs for a given event id).
