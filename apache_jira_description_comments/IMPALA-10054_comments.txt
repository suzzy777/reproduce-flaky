[~rizaon] I'm assigning this to you as the failing test was introduced in IMPALA-6692 that you worked on.

Hi [~attilaj] , the query estimate is probably off somehow or the mem limit specified in not enough anymore. I'll look into this.

CR is here: [https://gerrit.cloudera.org/c/16301]

Saw this again https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-from-scratch/11489/testReport/query_test.test_sort/TestQueryFullSort/test_multiple_sort_run_bytes_limits_protocol__beeswax___exec_option____batch_size___0___num_nodes___0___disable_codegen_rows_threshold___0___disable_codegen___False___abort_on_error___1___exec_single_node_rows_threshold___0____table_format__parquet_none_/

IMPALA-10054: Fix flakiness in test_multiple_sort_run_bytes_limits

test_multiple_sort_run_bytes_limits seems to become flaky in
ubuntu-16.04-dockerised-tests. This flakiness may come from accuracy
change in query estimates, the mem_limit specified in the test does not
fit anymore, or query concurrency in mini cluster that may disturb
expected memory allocation. This patch remove the second test case of
test_multiple_sort_run_bytes_limits due to variability in several test
run in the past. It does not compromise the test itself because the
basic feature of sort_run_bytes_limit is still verifiable by the
remaining test cases. The assertion is also changed a bit to allow
easier debugging in case test regression occurs again in the future.

Testing:
- Run and pass test_sort.py

The fix has been merged. Sorry for the trouble.

[~rizaon] this has reoccurred in [https://master-02.jenkins.cloudera.com/job/impala-cdpd-master-core-asan/454/]

Could you please have a look at it?

Hi [~luksan] , it seems my patch for this issue has not been propagated to downstream branch?

Right, that is the problem. Should we leave this Jira open until it gets cherry-picked or we can close it now? (the current process is not entirely clear to me)

[~rizaon] [~norbertluksa] The answer is that this is the issue tracker for Apache Impala. Since this is fixed in Apache Impala, it can be resolved. Any other entity that maintains its own copy of Impala should use their own issue tracker for internal discussions.

I see, thanks for clarifying!
