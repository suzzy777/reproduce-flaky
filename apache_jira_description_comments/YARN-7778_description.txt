When we have multiple constraints defined for a given set of allocation tags at different levels (i.e., at the cluster, the application or the scheduling request level), we need to merge those constraints.

Defining constraint levels as cluster > application > scheduling request, constraints defined at lower levels should only be more restrictive than those of higher levels. Otherwise the allocation should fail.

For example, if there is an application level constraint that allows no more than 5 HBase containers per rack, a scheduling request can further restrict that to 3 containers per rack but not to 7 containers per rack.
