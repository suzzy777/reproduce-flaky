We have

- outdated checkstyle.xml
- old maven checkstyle plugin
- no detailed style guide for java code (e.g available plugins)

Addtionally, it seems that some modules do not run checkstyle goal during build phase

By fixing those issues, we can keep our code clean. It will results the number of rebase count (reduced conflict due to just style) and boost our productivity
