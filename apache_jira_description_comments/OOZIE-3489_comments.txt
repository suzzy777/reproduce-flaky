The reason for the flakiness is the fact thatÂ {{KillXCommand}} changes the status of the action to KILLED and queues {{ActionKillXCommand}} s: https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/command/wf/KillXCommand.java#L151-L157

Later {{ActionKillXCommand}} tries to kill the yarn job, but we don't really have any yarn job in this test, so it will change the status to FAILED.

If the assert run before {{ActionKillXCommand}} it's good, if it runs later, it gives an error.

I've changed the code, to also accept FAILED status, I've also cleaned the code a bit.
