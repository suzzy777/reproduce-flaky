Happened again on [#916|https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/916]

I've looked at it and don't see any problem here. Attached logs don't have any tests failing, and above traceback of exception is normal since it tests initialization of invalid repo class. It would be nice if you could give more details on what is considered flaky test here.
