Going for Jackson version {{2.4.2}} as this is the one Spark 1.6.1 uses - previous attempt w/ {{2.9.2}} gave various class loading problems.

[~asasvari] [~gezapeti] can you have a look? Thanks!

I'm concerned about the Spark version conflict. We have a spark-2 profile that uses [Spar 2.1.0|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/pom.xml#L1982] and people are using Oozie with Spark 2.x more and more.
Maybe we should consider bumping the default Spark version to something higher and incorporate this change only afterwards.

{{mvn dependency:tree}} shows that multiple sharelibs are depending on {{jackson-core-asl}} (for example Hive, Hive 2, Pig, Spark, Sqoop, Streaming). I am a bit concerned that doing this change may cause runtime failures because of conflicting versions. Have you submitted example workflows?

if I see correctly we're only using jackson in the server side and in the Oozie client. In the sharelib we're only using it in tests. We could get away by changing the scope or changing that tests to not do that so we don't use jackson in our sharelibs at all.

There are transitive dependencies. Spark ShareLib for example:

I would submit the example workflows to verify it does not cause issues.

[~asasvari] following examples have been run on a local Oozie server, local pseudo-distributed Hadoop 2.6.5 successfully:
* {{aggregator}}
* {{bundle}}
* {{coord-input-logic}}
* {{cron}}
* {{cron-schedule}}
* {{custom-main}}
* {{datelist-java-main}}
* {{demo}}
* {{distcp}}
* {{hadoop-el}}
* {{java-main}}
* {{map-reduce}}
* {{no-op}}
* {{pig}}
* {{shell}}
* {{sla}}
* {{sqoop}}
* {{sqoop-freeform}}
* {{streaming}}
* {{subwf}}
* {{spark}}

Didn't try because locally components weren't available / more setup steps would have been needed:
* {{hcatalog}}
* {{hive}}
* {{hive2}}
* {{pyspark}}
* {{ssh}}

I think most potential {{sharelib}} conflicts have been tested with. What are your thoughts?

[~gezapeti] are you suggesting to switch to {{<scope>test</scope>}} inside {{sharelib}} for Jackson dependencies?

[~andras.piros] thanks for submitting example workflows. Workflows succeeded, so it looks good to me. [~gezapeti] can you answer last question?

(If it breaks Hive workflows, we can file a separate JIRA. It would be nice to validate.)

I'll take a look at dependencies, but in theory the server's version of jackson should not affect the version of jackson shipped in the sharelibs.

Thanks [~asasvari] for the review! [~gezapeti] can you please have another review?

I don't see the servers' jackson versions messing with the sharelibs. +1

Thanks [~gezapeti]! Committed to {{master}}.

Closing issue; Oozie 5.0.0 is released.
