sorry, i mistakenly put this Jira ID for an [unrelated PR|https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4976] - fixed now.

based on discussion on mailing list, there was a request for a rebase on the original PR that accommodated all vector APIs.  I haven't and probably won't have time to do this.  It was mentioned that just redoing ArrowBuf to use 64-bit address space might be more palatable.  So I'm going to focus on making that happen.

 

This will make it possible to support LargeBinary and LargeString (with the limitation that string length will still probably be practically limited to 2GB for most APIs).

 

However, for LargeArray child arrays will still be limited to 2 billion entries so this would be of limited utility.
