[~zjushch], mind taking a look at it?  thanks

Yes, this was a big improvement. [~xieliang007] -- I am also talking about getting JVM GC settings that I used so far. 

Feel free to put me on code review for this.

Patch is good for me.

Move the new class 'ConcurrentIndex'  to util package?

v2 addressed chunhui's comment

[~zjushch],[~avf],  how about patch v2? thanks!

How to know what's the exact javadoc/findbugs warnings from jenkins?

For ConcurrentIndex class, please add annotation for audience and stability.
{code}
+  static class DefaultValueSetFactory<V> implements Supplier<Set<V>> {
{code}
Can DefaultValueSetFactory be private ?
{code}
+    List<BlockCacheKey> keysForHFile = ImmutableList.copyOf(keySet);
{code}
In evictBlocksByHfileName():
{code}
+    List<BlockCacheKey> keysForHFile = ImmutableList.copyOf(keySet);
{code}
Should the copy be made inside ConcurrentIndex#values() ?

Some comments from me (original author of this code in 89-fb):

1) This should be annotated as Threadsafe
2) Nit-pick (this is my own typo): "comparator specified when the class instance was constructor" -> "when the class instance was _constructed_"

Addressing Ted's comments:

1) [~tedyu@apache.org] - re: make DefaultValueSetFactory private -- Yes since it's static inner class it might as well be private.

2) Depends -- you need to do ImmustableList.copyOf() for iteration. This is generally the contract of most other collections in j.u which would thrown ConcurrentModificationException. Returning the results as a set can make membership tests efficient. ImmutableList.copyOf is used for iteration as that is the cheapest way to make a copy.

Other:

[~xieliang007] Can you look through the findbugs -- I'd think they are mostly red herrings, but I'd double check if the equals/hashCode() ones are relevant. 

Thanks for porting this over!

v3 addressed the above comments.
do we have any methods/scripts available to look at what's the extra findbug warnings introducted by this patch from the jenkins's report?
or maybe it was caused by other jira's?  i tried to check the warning from the new added class in my local findbug binary, it showed 0 warning.

v4 fixed javadoc warnings

Committed this improvement on 0.96 (because bucket cache an experimental feature) and on trunk.  Thanks for the forward port [~xieliang007] (and to the reviewers)

On 0.96, mvn test -Dtest=TestHRegion#testParallelAppendWithMemStoreFlush is now flaky.
I've ran 50 tests on the previous commit, it works. With this commit in, it fails 20% of the time:

Failed tests:   testParallelAppendWithMemStoreFlush(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestHRegion): array lengths differed, expected.length=2000 actual.length=1996

I didn't test on trunk.

[~nkeywal], per my yesterday's experiment ,the failure was caused by HBASE-8942 in deed, not this jira:)  thanks all the same.

Sorry about the false alarm, [~xieliang007]. I swear I really ran the tests 50 times :-)! Thanks for finding out the right jira that caused the issue.

[~dnicolas] haha:)

Released in 0.96.1.  Issue closed.
