[~SGrimstad] Do we have a chance to resolve this ticket until the code freeze of 2.7?

Status is in Review, so I expect it to be resolved for 2.7

[~SGrimstad], my comments:
# I would rename annotation to {{StatefulAffinity}} or so
# What was our agreement about default behavior? Should we enable new mode by default? I think yes, because it will allow users to spot co-location problems as early as possible
# Please confirm that query over statefult affinity + REPLICATED caches work fine (I cannot see that from code, seems that exception is thrown immediately when we observe stateful affinity)
# The check is not applied to local queries. Seems that we need to perform it earlier using {{PreparedStatementEx}} using the technique explained in IGNITE-7039 and IGNITE-6677.

Not relevant for now.
