[~echauchot] do you still work on this or know who might be able to help?

Hi Kenn, Thanks for raising this. I don't work on this but I can take a look. To be honest 10% range for the assertion was quite random guess. As it is a minor change I could do it quickly myself changing the percentage and the assertion method.

[~kenn], fixed. Here is the PR [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12276]

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12276 is merged. Can we close this?

Hey Ahmet ! Usually for flakes I leave 2 weeks to have enough historical data before considering that the flakiness is solved. And it isn't in that case but the PR allowed me to see that the estimated size returned by the IO can be multiplied by 2 in some cases (maybe apache cassandra internal size estimates are not updated in some cases) way above the 20% margin I let in the test condition. I'll take a look and change to a proper test condition.

here is the last flake after the PR that improves the failure message and sets the margin to 20%:

[https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Commit/12690/testReport/org.apache.beam.sdk.io.cassandra/CassandraIOTest/testEstimatedSizeBytes/]

just submitted this PR: [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12432] that updates the internal cassandra size estimates after insertion. If it does not give consistent sizes over time, I'll change the acceptance condition is the test to size > 0 to avoid flakiness

 

 

Merging the PR as soon as the CI is green. I'll then wait for a couple of weeks to see if the flakiness is gone

still failing. The history ( [https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Commit/12690/testReport/junit/org.apache.beam.sdk.io.cassandra/CassandraIOTest/testEstimatedSizeBytes/history/?start=50]) shows that there was only one failure (08/06) since PR merge. Right now I have no clue why the size estimation is twice bigger in rare cases. It is certainly a cassandra internal behavior. What I suggest is to change the test condition to size > 0 to at least test that the dataset will be split.

I just submitted a PR for that: [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12510]
