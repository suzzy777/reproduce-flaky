Now,Â we have 3 possible ways to process segmentation by means of {{{}SegmentationPolicy{}}}:
 # Stop segmented node - {{SegmentationPolicy#STOP}}
 # Restart segmented node - {{SegmentationPolicy#RESTART_JVM}}
 # Do nothing - {{SegmentationPolicy#NOOP}}

Under the hood, behavior of segmentation handling (i.e. failure handling) is overridden [1, 2]. 
For example, instead of using {{StopNodeOrHaltFailureHandler}} configured by default, default segmentation handling will use {{StopNodeFailureHandler}} which can hang during stop process.

As a solution, we can add extra {{SegmentationPolicy#USE_FAILURE_HANDLER}} which will be used by default.
