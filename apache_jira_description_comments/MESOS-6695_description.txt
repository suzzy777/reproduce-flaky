This does not require enabling every test, as inevitably there will be disabled tests. However, all test files should be ported to Windows, and for each disabled test, an associated issue should exist. The exception is if the test does not make sense whatsoever for Windows, in which case it should be compiled out instead of temporarily disabled.
