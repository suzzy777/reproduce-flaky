commit 46328dc86ddf12891550e40d02e628ee11ae0ad2
Author: NSAmelchev <nsamelchev@...>

    Fix SynchronizationMode

----


I have fixed follow tests: 
- testMultiThreadStatisticsEnable
- testClusterApiClearStatistics
- testClearStatisticsAfterDisableStatistics
- testJmxApiClearStatistics
- testCacheApiClearStatistics 
Problem was wrong sync mode. I have ran tests on [TC 100 times|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1856932&tab=testsInfo&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Cache7]. It's OK. 
[~garus.d.g], could you review, please?

LGTM

(i) this also fixed some other flaky tests: {{CacheMetricsManageTest.testClusterApiClearStatistics}} and {{CacheMetricsManageTest.testCacheApiClearStatistics}} (for the latter, Teamcity history for last few weeks shows that test case failures stopped appearing after this change was merged to master)
