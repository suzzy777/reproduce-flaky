    Is it ok to remove it?

    @jongyoul just wanted make sure the failure is coming from `WelcomePageSuite` it self, not as a side effect of other problems.
    
    I'll close this PR and open another PR once i found fix.

    @Leemoonsoo I think to prolong timeout would be realistic solution but same error may occurs when travis is under resources starvation. Can we handle it? 


Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1919
  
    @jongyoul I don't have any good idea except for change test to use less resources when travis is under resource starvation. Do you have any good idea?


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    @Leemoonsoo Actually, in this case, I also don't have any better idea than what you do :-) Just worried about becoming more rare flaky test.
