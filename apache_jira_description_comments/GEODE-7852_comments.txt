GEODE-7852: Adding a SocketFactory configuration for client Pools (#4830)

Adding the ability to provide a SocketFactory to a client pool for use in
creating sockets. Adding an implementation of this SocketFactory that
configures the pool to use an SNI proxy.

Adding an automated test of the SniSocketFactory that uses docker compose
to use a real SNI proxy and geode servers that are not reachable without
going through the proxy.

Most of these resources are fairly specific to this test. Moving them all to a
package named sni.

Reopening in order to add documentation and fix declarative cache (XML) problems.

GEODE-7852: test ClientHealthMonitor functionality behind a SNI gateway

This ensures that a server sitting behind an SNI gateway detects the
loss of a client and cleans up after it.  In this case the test detects
that the server has closed CQs created by the non-durable client.

Since test code is not accessible in the Docker container that's running
the server I've enhanced the StatArchiveReader to be able to report the
values of a statistic and have enabled statistics recording in the
server.
