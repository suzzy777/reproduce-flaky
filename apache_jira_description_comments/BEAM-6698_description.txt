After upgrade to gradle 5 [1], the two portable runner test projects on jenkins
 - beam_PostCommit_Java_PVR_Flink_Streaming [2]
 - beam_PostCommit_Java_PVR_Flink_Batch [3]

became flaky.

First investigation seems to point the tests to be failing on direct buffer memory (e.g. [4]) while staging files.

Although I am unsure, whether this is really the root cause, or something that shows up after some other failure.

INFO: Transport failed
org.apache.beam.vendor.grpc.v1p13p1.io.netty.util.internal.OutOfDirectMemoryError: failed to allocate 16777216 byte(s) of direct memory (used: 1895825695, max: 1908932608)
{noformat}
As far as I know, we do not set `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize` anywhere in our setup, neither does gradle itself. At least on my machine both gradle 4 and gradle 5 stick to the same jvm default

Unfortunately this does not reproduce on (my) local machine. We might try to workaround here by increasing ` -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize==3G` but this would probably only hide the problem? But might still be helpful to increase temporarily on branch just to be sure, that this is indeed the root cause?
