JPAService is becoming null in the test somewhere and there are NPE because of that. 

For eg: https://builds.apache.org/job/oozie-trunk-precommit-build/1291/testReport/junit/org.apache.oozie.command.coord/TestCoordUpdateXCommand/testUpdateControl/

Taking this up. Thanks for shortlisting the subset of tests to reproduce the issue Robert :)

{{org.apache.oozie.command.coord.TestCoordActionInputCheckXCommand.testActionInputCheckLatestCurrentTime}} also failing because JPAService null. Same class test but using latest calculation with rest to action creation time (old behavior) {{org.apache.oozie.command.coord.TestCoordActionInputCheckXCommand.testActionInputCheckLatestActionCreationTime}} however, failing with a dependency mismatch problem - OOZIE-1872

I'd suggest getting rid of the static reference to JPAService in each of the Query Executors. We can always get the reference to it from the Services singleton, while executing the query. By keeping another static reference and manipulating it through the constructor and destroy(), we run the risk of nullifying it inadvertently. This is why suddenly so many tests are becoming flaky and it is very tough to detect exact patterns or even fix tests in a foolproof way. 

I ran the whole suit with the static reference removed and only 2 tests failed - which is quite an improvement!
{code}
Results :

Failed tests:   testBundleId(org.apache.oozie.servlet.TestBulkMonitorWebServiceAPI): expected:<SUCCEEDED> but was:<RUNNING>

Tests in error: 
  testSucCoordPurgeXCommand(org.apache.oozie.command.TestPurgeXCommand): E0604: Job does not exist [0000000-140724213655573-oozie-chit-C]
{code}

Test#2 here is failing with error StoreService cannot work without JPAService. We can replace usage of StoreService completely as it is superceded by JPAService anyway.
Test #1 doesnt really have any error except random assert fail, and this test is not usually flaky so can ignore


attaching patch which fixes the QueryExecutors and TestSLAEventGeneration. Errors related to StoreService usage in tests can be fixed as part of overall StoreService fix in OOZIE-1952

above failures due to strange network error on the host. Happened before at https://builds.apache.org/job/oozie-trunk-precommit-build/1363/ too.

Ran the whole suit locally and only 1 failed, which I've mentioned is going to be part of OOZIE-1952.

{{. -1 the patch contains 2 line(s) with trailing spaces}} located and fixed in the xml file - {{coord-action-sla.xml}}

Please keep the private static BundleJobQueryExecutor instance = new BundleJobQueryExecutor(); and the empty private constructor. Else this being a singleton will have race condition problem instantiating more than one object. 

Also remove if (instance == null) {} check in getInstance() and @VisibleForTesting annotation in destroy(). Actually you can remove the whole destroy() method. 

addressed review comments and fixed couple of classes missed in earlier patch - BatchQueryExecutor, SLA*QueryExecutors to be consistent

GET_COORD_ACTION_IDS_FOR_DATES_ACTIVE changes do not seem to belong to this patch.

good catch! uploaded new patch

+1. This needs to go into 4.1 as well.
