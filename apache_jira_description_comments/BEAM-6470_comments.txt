Failing test [https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Python_VR_Flink/33/]

This is a duplicate of BEAM-6469, but removing tenacity might still make sense.

So shall we remove the dependency on tenacity from the tests completely?

We can, though it doesn't seem to be necessary. The main cause of the failure were the missing test dependencies.

If you want to fix this, fine with me, otherwise I'd mark this with Won't Fix.

Thanks!

Will mark it won't fix for now.
