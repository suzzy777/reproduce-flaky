This looks like a bug in the test; not in the product. Note that the failure is caused by this cast exception:
Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.GIIDeltaDUnitTest$32$1 cannot be cast to com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.GIIDeltaDUnitTest$BlockMessageObserver
at com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.GIIDeltaDUnitTest.resetSlowGII(GIIDeltaDUnitTest.java:2544)
at com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.cache.GIIDeltaDUnitTest.lambda$preTearDownCacheTestCase$84651174$1(GIIDeltaDUnitTest.java:113)

This test method has code that calls DistributionMessageObserver.setInstance twice with calls that would have set it to an instance of GIIDeltaDUnitTest$32$1. If these end up not getting cleaned up before tear down then the unconditional call of resetSlowGII will result in this class cast exception.


Flaky: orphaned AsyncInvocations, time sensitive, GC, waitForCriterion, thread unsafe test hooks/observers, expiration

Closing due to inactivity.  Please reopen if this test fails again.

This issue has either failed to reproduce or been fixed systemically elsewhere (e.g. improving port selection and timeouts).  Closing but please reopen if needed.
