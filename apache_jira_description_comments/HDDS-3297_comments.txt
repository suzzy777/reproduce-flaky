See HDDS-3257 for several such tests (including TestOzoneClientKeyGenerator).  I tend to think it's a real issue, not test flakiness.  TestOzoneClientKeyGenerator only has a single, straightforward test case.  No manual datanode start/stop or other potentially disruptive operations.  I don't see how the test might have a bug that could be fixed.

[~adoroszlai], you are right. The issue seems to be happening with Ratis intermittently with specific sequence. It's not related to the test
