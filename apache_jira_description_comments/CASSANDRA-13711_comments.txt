FWIW, this is not a cqlsh bug, repro's on python drivers, and does not repro on 2.1

[~blerer] you were in this code recently, interested in reviewing? If not, [~beobal] or [~iamaleksey] ?

Committed to 3.0 as {{9dc896f4ea51276de4ea76ffca3fd719e0c8b8a1}} and merged 3.11 and 4.0


The unit tests committed with that ticket are pretty fragile because they insert with a TTL of 100 and expect a following read to get the same TTL of 100, but a read give you the remaining TTL (and this is returning with a 1 second precision), so on a slow run or through some timing issue you can easily get a failure with:
{noformat}
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Invalid value for row 0 column 3 (ttl(i) of type int), expected <100> but got <99>
	at org.apache.cassandra.cql3.CQLTester.assertRows(CQLTester.java:1255)
	at org.apache.cassandra.cql3.validation.operations.SelectTest.testMixedTTLOnColumnsWide(SelectTest.java:4806)
{noformat}
[~jjirsa]: Would you mind having a look at making those tests less flaky? (personally don't mind if you'd rather ninja-fix).

I saw him open it as CASSANDRA-13764 - let me fix it there just so we don't re-open this
