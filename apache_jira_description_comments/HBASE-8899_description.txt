Looked into the failure of an AM none-flaky test:

http://54.241.6.143/job/HBase-0.95-Hadoop-2/org.apache.hbase$hbase-server/583/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master/TestAssignmentManagerOnCluster/testForceAssignWhileClosing/

The test failed to open a region on a server where the region was being closed.  Region server just returned ALREADY_OPENED while the region was actually being closed.
