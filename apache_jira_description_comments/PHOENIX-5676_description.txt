If a data-table has TTL on it, it's indexes inherit the TTL too. Hence when we run IndexTool with verification on such tables and it's indexes, rows that are near expiry will successfully get rebuilt, but may not be returned on verification read due to expiry. This will result in index verification problem and may also fail rebuild job.
