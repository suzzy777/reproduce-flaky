Hello! Are you still working on this issue? Any updates?

[~mmuzaf] It's almost finished. I'm just waiting for the tests finishing.

Hello, any updates over this issue?

[~mmuzaf], Unfortunately, these changes found the bug in discovery and I had stuck on the investigation of this problem for a while. But looks like I've understood the issue and I have some solution. I believe I'll extract this problem to another ticket because it's not simple changes. And I hope in the nearest time I'll finish this task.

[~akalashnikov]Â looks good, let's merge it. I hope that there were no new tests with that property in last few days.

Looks good to me as well, merged to master. [~mmuzaf], can you cherry-pick the commit to ignite-2.8?

cherry-picked to 2.8

It seems to me we've got flaky failures here due to these changes.

https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Cache5&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=ignite-2.8&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv

It seems the same tests have been affected by the initial PR too [pull/7150/head] (before merge to master)
