The client (in the function HConnectionManager#processBatchCallback) works in two steps:
 - make the requests
 - collect the failures and successes and prepare for retry

It means that when there is an immediate error (region moved, split, dead server, ...) we still wait for all the initial requests to be executed before submitting again the failed request. If we have a scenario with all the requests taking 5 seconds we have a final execution time of: 5 (initial requests) + 1 (wait time) + 5 (final request) = 11s.

We could improve this by analyzing immediately the results. This would lead us, for the scenario mentioned above, to 6 seconds. 

So we could have a performance improvement of nearly 50% in many cases, and much more than 50% if the request execution time is different.
