HI,[~kmarton],I have noticed this problem. Because findbugs always warning about this issue.

That's great [~nobigo], findbugs will help us find the places we need to modify.

[~asalamon74]. Can you help me review this? Thank you !

Hi,[~asalamon74]. Can you help me review this? Thank  you very much

HI,[~asalamon74]. Can you help me review this? Thank  you very much.

Sure, this is in my review queue, but I need more time. 

Thanks for your patience [~nobigo] and thanks again for the patch. Most of it is OK, I have only one question:

Why do we need "import org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.ScriptTestAdapter;" in TestFsActionExecutor?

Thanks for the next patch [~nobigo]

It seems to me you also removed the import which became unused after your modification like {{import java.io.FileReader}} which is very good. Occasionally you also removed other unused imports from the same files, which is also OK.

Sometimes you also remove unused import from files, where you don't modify anything UTF-8 related (like {{TestLauncherAMUtils}} or {{SparkConfigurationService}}. I would rather not modify those files in this patch, because it's not related to the UTF-8 change.
