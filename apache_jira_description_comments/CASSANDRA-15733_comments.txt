patch includes dtest + trunk, once the code is approved I will write for 2.2, 3.0, and 3.11

Thank you for the patch; left minor comments on both PRs.

fixed 2 of the comments and replied back to the other one about where configs should be generated.

since the dtest changes are OKed, ill send a patch for all 4 branches.

[~ifesdjeen] sent PR for trunk, 3.11, 3.0, and 2.2   I was able to run the tests for 3.x, but 2.2 was hard to see with the spam, would be easier once there is a dtest jar that CI can use.

[~dcapwell] committed in-jvm-dtest with [326045f699791686efa1ecf43b7353397c956494|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-in-jvm-dtest-api/commit/326045f699791686efa1ecf43b7353397c956494], and published a new snapshot {{0.0.2-326045f-SNAPSHOT}}. Please let me know when CI has ran so I could commit the rest. Thanks!

[1] - org.apache.cassandra.cql3.validation.entities.TypeTest#testDateCompatibility failed in 2.2, this was passing before so assume its a flaky test.  The code is jvm dtest so ignoring this error.
