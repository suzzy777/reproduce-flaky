Scenario:
- Run TPCH query20 @ 1 TB scale
- Tez master branch, Hive trunk
- auto-reduce parallelism is not an issue (happens with/without auto-reduce parallelism)

1 or 2 times in 10 runs, DAGAppMaster would freeze unexpectedly.  There is no pattern observed on which vertex it happens. But when this happens, only option is to kill the application.   I will attach the jstack soon, but that doesn't seem to reveal much.

Need to debug more; Creating this JIRA for tracking purposes.
