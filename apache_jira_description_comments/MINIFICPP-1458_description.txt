*Background:*

Some of the properties of InvokeHTTP eg. ("Put Response Body in Attribute") are not registered and therefore reported as incorrect when user tries to set them. They are also missing from the documentation page.

*Proposal:*

We should register the new properties and ensure they work as expected. Testing requirements and acceptance criteria to be refined.
