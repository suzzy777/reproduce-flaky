The unit test {{SASIIndexTest.testInsertingIncorrectValuesIntoAgeIndex}}Â seems to be flaky in 3.11, as it can be seen in [cassandra-ci|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/Cassandra%203.11/job/Cassandra-3.11-test/42/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.index.sasi/SASIIndexTest/testInsertingIncorrectValuesIntoAgeIndex/] and also locally. Trunk doesn't seem to be affected.

{{SASIIndexTest.testIndexMemtableSwitching}} is [also flaky|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/Cassandra%203.11/job/Cassandra-3.11-test/42/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.index.sasi/SASIIndexTest/testIndexMemtableSwitching/], although I haven't been able to reproduce it running it separately, but only when running the entire {{SASIIndexTest}}.

These could have been introduced when merging up CASSANDRA-15778, since they failed for their [CircleCI run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ifesdjeen/cassandra/17/workflows/0442eebe-c764-41c5-ba06-6617bcb9fc5f/jobs/2213], and they didn't seem to fail before that, or at least I cannot reproduce them locally with the previous commit.
