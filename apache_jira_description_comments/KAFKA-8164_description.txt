Failing flaky tests are often a problem:
* pull requests need to be rerun to achieve a green build
* rerunning the whole build for a PR is resource and time consuming
* green build give high confidence when releasing (and well, generally too) but flaky tests often erode this and annoying for the developers

The aim of this JIRA is to provide an improvement which automatically retries any tests that are failed for the first run.
