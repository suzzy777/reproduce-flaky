This test is failed consistently on runner v2 batch but flaky on runner v2 streaming.

Interesting, I don't see anything potentially flaky in the test, [~boyuanz] do you think it is problem only with Dataflow? I ran Dataflow validates runner suite on the PR, but suppose it doesn't run the v2?

No, the Dataflow validates runner suite doesn't include runner v2. We have a separate target to reduce the test time. Would you like to elaborate more on what the test is for?

Sure. The test validates that we are able to correctly apply change in WindowFn after a GBK. It resulted from discussion about a change in SparkRunner, which replaced `FullWindowedValueCoder` with `ValueOnlyWindowedValueCoder` (thus dropping timestamps), which resulted in fail in this test, because all data was placed into the same window. Long story short - this test validates that we propagate timestamp correctly downstream from GBK.
