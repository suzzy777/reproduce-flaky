Updatable views by definition outlined in PHOENIX-4555 are disjoint partitions/virtual tables on the base HBase table.
View indexes should only be allowed to be defined on these partitions.
As PHOENIX-7047 revealed index rows are not generated or get clobbered for certain multi-level views.

This JIRA will try and address these issues and add the proper constraints on when updatable views and view indexes can be created.
1. View should be allowed to extend the parent PK i.e. adding its own PK column in the view definition only when there are no indexes in the parent hierarchy.
and vice versa
2. View indexes can defined on a given view only when there are no child views that have extended the PK of the base view.
