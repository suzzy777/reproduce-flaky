I don't see how the two lines you've described can lead to concurrent heartbeats from the same tserver. Remember that TriggerASAP() doesn't actually send a heartbeat; it just instructs the tserver's heartbeater thread to send a heartbeat as soon as it can (and maybe wakes up the thread if it was asleep). There's still just one heartbeating thread per tserver per master, and the heartbeat is synchronous (i.e. the heartbeating thread waits for the master to respond before continuing its execution).
