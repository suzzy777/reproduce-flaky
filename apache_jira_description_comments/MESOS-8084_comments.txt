Fixed race in configureSignal and installCtrlHandler.

When multiple agents are spawned in a single process, they attempt to
install signal handler concurrently, causing tests, such as
`ExamplesTest.PersistentVolumeFramework` and
`ExamplesTest.DynamicReservationFramework` randomly fail. This adds
missing synchronization to `configureSignal` and `installCtrlHandler`
to resolve the issue.
