The default database location in testAlterTableRename is not that as specified by TEST_WAREHOUSE_DIR in HCatBaseTest. it looks like following in the precommit build:
{code}
pfile:/home/hiveptest/104.197.110.94-hiveptest-0/apache-github-source-source/hcatalog/core/target/warehouse
{code}
But the TEST_WAREHOUSE_DIR should actually be like:
{code}
file:/home/hiveptest/104.197.110.94-hiveptest-0/apache-github-source-source/hcatalog/core/build/test/data/org.apache.hive.hcatalog.mapreduce.HCatBaseTest-1477389203834/warehouse/oldname
{code}
It only happened in the precommit build but not the local environment. We need investigate the issue since it fails with HIVE-14909.
