The unit tests in {{KinesisDataFetcherTest}} have very flaky implementations. They rely on on thread sleeps to wait for a certain operation to happen, which can easily miss and cause tests to fail.

Although there isn't any reports of consistent failures on these tests yet (as far as I am aware of),  they can easily surface in the future.
