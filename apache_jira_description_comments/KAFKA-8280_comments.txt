We didn't put the latest failed error stack trace, which is not easy to investigate. Maybe we can re-enable it and gather the failed message when occurrence?

+1 on re-enabling, I run this over 20k times without being able to reproduce. 

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-6527?focusedCommentId=17554981&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17554981

This test is currently getting skipped. Moving this Jira to the next release (3.4.0).

The ticket is not assigned so moving to the next release.

Moving it to 3.7.0 as we are near code freeze and it is not assigned.

Changing target fix version to 3.8 since this is not a blocker and we are cutting a 3.7 RC
