Fixed SLS.

Barely skimmed through the patch. In ResourceTrackerService, when creating the NodeStatusEvent, should we just include remoteNodeStatus instead of each of its members? 

It would change the previous code a lot but I think it would be cleaner. I can do a proposal with that.

Packing elements of RMNodeStatusEvent into NodeStatus

+1 this would be very useful to have... Will enable even better packing.

Merging to trunk

Missing key

Thanks Inigo. Looks generally good. Comments:
# javadoc error in SchedulerNode
# Can we make the necessary changes on FairScheduler and FifoScheduler as well? It should be similar and straight-forward. 

Not sure if there is a simple way to test this. Can we leverage the SLS to verify the node utilization passed in the heartbeat shows up in the scheduler? If not, I am comfortable with checking this in without a test. 

Adding utilizaiton to FIFO and Fair scheduler.

I added the info to the FIFO and Fair schedulers.
I'm rerunning the checks because I couldn't figure the errors in the Javadoc and the report is out.

Regarding the test, we will add a unit test with the mini cluster.

Just noticed this ticket. [~sunilg], since this patch is almost ready to go, if you think it's fine, could you update YARN-4292 to base on this one? And could you take a look at this patch to see if there's any changes need to merge?

[~goiri], thanks for working on this, two comments
{code}
352	  public void setContainersUtilization(
353	      ResourceUtilization containersUtilization) {
354	    if (containersUtilization != null) {
355	      this.containersUtilization = containersUtilization;
356	    }
357	  }
{code}
It seems SchedulerNode cannot update containerUtilization since it's always not null. I think you should directly update utilization when set.
And I suggest to update SchedulerNode.containersUtilization/nodeUtilization to use violate.

And for naming, I suggest to change getContainersUtilization in RMNode/SchedulerNode/RMNodeStatusEvent to get*Aggregated*ContainersUtilization, which is more straight forward to me.

How does the violate thing work? Do you have any example?

I'll change the naming for getContainersUtilization.

Sorry, it's typo, I meant: volatile.

OK, I'll try it for both.

Moved ContainersUitlization to AggregatedContainersUtilization.
Made volatile in SchedulerNode.

I uploaded a patch with all the changes but I'm not completely sure about the "if (containersUtilization != null)".
I'll test in the real system but I'd say that I needed it.

Moved ContainersUitlization to AggregatedContainersUtilization.
Made volatile in SchedulerNode.

Moved ContainersUitlization to AggregatedContainersUtilization.

Fixed javadoc style issue.
The checkstyle errors look like pedantic mode to me; let me know if you want me to fix any but they don't seem very reasonable.
The failed unit tests look like not related.

Thanks for update [~elgoiri], patch looks good to me. [~kasha] do you want to take another check?

I believe we are waiting for the test to be added here, will let [~elgoiri] comment to the status of that. 

Give us a couple hours. If it's not done by today we should go ahead though.
The test will be to put the utilization in the NodeResourceMonitor and the ContainersMonitor and check it in the scheduler.

We are failing miserably with the mini cluster. Do you guys mind committing this one and once we have a unit test, we open a new JIRA with it?

I feel it should be fine to commit this patch without test.

Added unit tests.

I think this unit tests cover what we wanted to test. Let's wait for Jenkins to provide style feedback, etc.

Thanks [~elgoiri] for the patch. [~leftnoteasy], I missed this somehow.
For YARN-4292, these changes here looks good and fine. I had some similar changes there too, which can be removed as we get the resource utilization through heartbeat after this patch.


As with the previous one, the checkstyles seem a little bit pedantic (I can fix them if needed) and the failed tests seem unrelated to the patch.

The newly added unit tests (TestMiniYarnClusterNodeUtilization) are generating timeout errors.  The logs do not have any information/exceptions.  I have tested locally and can complete these tests in 17-18 seconds.  Other unit mini yarn cluster unit tests also require 15-20 seconds (TestMiniYarnCluster) to complete.

Are there any time limits for unit tests?  Is it possible to see additional jenkins logs to understand where the tests may have stopped?

Reviewing the latest patch here. 

Neat test using the MiniYarnCluster. 

Comments on the patch (hopefully, the last set), assuming the patch adds only test-related code. 
# The new tests have spurious exceptions in the declaration.
# The tests sleep for 2 seconds waiting for the heartbeat to propagate. Can we lower any configured timeouts to avoid this long sleep? 
# javadoc is off in the new test class - can we fix them? Looks like the params in javadoc don't match the args in the declaration. I am comfortable with not adding params to the javadoc since they are mostly private methods.
# verifySimulatedUtilization doesn't need to take any arguments; nodeStatus is already private and can be used directly? The sleep could also go there. 
# You could specify timeouts on the tests - would recommend being conservative to avoid the test getting killed on Jenkins. 

I'll take care of those changes.
The only one we need to skip is #2 as we tested with 1 second and sometimes the unit tests failed ; I'd like to prevent flakiness on the tests.

Tackling Karthik's comments.

Increasing timeout to 2 seconds again because unit tests fail.

Jenkins could be running on a (virtual) machine much slower than dev machines. Could we sleep for longer to ensure it doesn't fail on Jenkins. How about the following:
{code} 
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  Thread.sleep(100);
  // check if heartbeat propagated
}
{code}

Any easy place to check in the RM for the heartbeats?

Waiting for heartbeat to propagate based on the expected value. This apporoahc is simlar to what is used in TestDiskFailures.
