Support was added within the following PRs to support BagState, ValueState and CombiningState within the Java SDK harness:
* https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3795
* https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3788
* https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3783
* https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3760
* https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3736
* https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3724
* https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3723
* https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3638

The remaining features are:
* Add support for closing the BeamFnStateGrpcClientCache which should cancel outgoing calls.
* Handle outputting state which is > 2GiB by using a chunking output stream
* Move to an asynchronous persist model so that we can flush state since we currently cache all changes and only emit at the end of the process bundle call.
* Add map and set support

These items will improve performance:
* Support block level caching and prefetch
* Support caching of state beyond the lifetime of a single bundle
* Support readLater by issuing a prefetch
* Optimize squashing accumulators in CombiningState
