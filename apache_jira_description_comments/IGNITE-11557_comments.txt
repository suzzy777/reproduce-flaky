[~jooger], my comments:
# {{SqlSystemViewsSelfTest}} - unused imports
# {{SqlTestFunctions}} - Thread.sleep() function is not reliable. Thread may be woken up earlier than expected, what will cause flaky failures again. I would rather use busy wait with or (sleep + busy wait) with time checks before and after. If the difference after wake up is smaller than needed, burn some cycles until it is enough.
