We have a method in AccumulatorSuite called verifyPeakExecutionMemorySet. This is used in a variety of other test suites, including (but not limited to):

- ExternalAppendOnlyMapSuite
- ExternalSorterSuite
- sql.SQLQuerySuite

Lately it's been flaky ever since https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10835 was merged. Note: this was an existing problem even before that patch, but it was uncovered there because previously we never failed the test even if an assertion error failed!
