[~gharris] [~ChrisEgerton] should we disable this test in trunk until it is fixed by the associated ticket tracking the bug? 

[~divijvaidya] I apologize for the flakiness of the test, It's a lot worse than I expected.

I've opened a patch that should fix the bug and stabilize the test that we can hopefully get merged this week or next.

We merged KAFKA-15202 and the flakiness decreased substantially, with only 2 failures in the past week. I'll continue to monitor this but it shouldn't be a blocker for the upcoming release.

Moving it to 3.7.0 as we are near code freeze and it is not a blocker.

Changing target fix version to 3.8 since this is not a blocker and we are cutting a 3.7 RC
