FYI, it's easy to run a local Jenkins instance for prototyping using Docker:Â 

{{docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:lts}}

This change broke phrase triggering for unrelated changes and is being reverted: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/5638

The interaction between phrase triggering and includedRegions appears to be a deficiency in the ghprb plugin; I've [filed a bug|https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin/issues/678] and it looks like it's simple so perhaps we can contribute the fix.

I've [submitted a patch|https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin/pull/680] to the upstream ghprb-plugin; we'll see if it gets accepted.

The new plan is to create separate Jenkins jobs which trigger separately based on PR contents or trigger phrase.

This is in review: [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/5757]
