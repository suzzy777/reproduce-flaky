I saw a failure similar to this today in a private CI environment:

This test doesn't exist  on 4.0, the failure is from 3.0. Changing the version

I am not able to reproduce it in my environment but I see it also flaky in Jenkins:

[https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-3.0/91/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test/GossipTest/nodeDownDuringMove/history/]

bq. This test doesn't exist  on 4.0

That seems be to in error to me, since moving nodes is equally valid in all versions.

Agreed, I put it on my list to check separately why it is missing there, whether it is covered under another test or what happened

I just checked the history and it seems that new tests were added to GossipTest in 3.11 and during their merge to 4.0, this one got probably lost. I think it was by mistake but I will check also the tickets and the exact tests again in detail on Monday. 

According to Jenkins there are no known failures in 3.11. And I returned the 4.0 rc fix version to the ticket as we need to return the test to trunk. Whether it is also flaky on 4.0, that we need to test.

I found CASSANDRA-15148 opened already for the missing test in trunk. It was waiting on few tickets to be closed because the patch for the scenario tested in trunk was different. I suggest we keep this for 3.0 and investigate it separately.

Un-assigning myself for now as I am still struggling to reproduce the issue in any environment. I might come back to this again but if someone has something in the meanwhile, feel free to add it

Closing as part of a batch operation on 2021-09-13 on all test tickets >= 52 weeks old. Please re-open if this is still a valid ticket.

Reopening per CASSANDRA-17348.

This fails now in a different way on trunk - [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1883/workflows/affb76fc-2071-4b15-a430-4169aad0a86d/jobs/14875/tests#failed-test-0]

 

I will test now on previous branches too to update the ticket
