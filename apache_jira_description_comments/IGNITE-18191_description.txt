Looks like .Net platform and examples do not support recent versions of Java. It requires a special set of JVM arguments to run AI on Java 15+ (see [jvmdefaults.sh|https://github.com/apache/ignite/blob/master/bin/include/jvmdefaults.sh]), but .Net runner only contains checks and arguments for Java 9+ (see [Jmv.cs|https://github.com/apache/ignite/blob/master/modules/platforms/dotnet/Apache.Ignite.Core/Impl/Unmanaged/Jni/Jvm.cs]). Looks like new arguments should be added here.
