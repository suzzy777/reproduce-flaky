Same commit pass in my fork https://github.com/kezhuw/zookeeper/actions/runs/5229684461.

And an independent report appears in [ZOOKEEPER-4628|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-4628?focusedCommentId=17632044&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17632044], unfortunate, the run cache has been cleared.
