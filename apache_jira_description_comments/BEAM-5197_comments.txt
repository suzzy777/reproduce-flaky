Another flake: https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Cron/565/testReport/junit/org.apache.beam.runners.flink.streaming/UnboundedSourceWrapperTest$ParameterizedUnboundedSourceWrapperTest/testWatermarkEmission_numTasks___4__numSplits_1_/

Should be resolved. Feel free to reopen if there are more flaky runs.

From what I can tell, this removed the flakiness and made the test permanently failing :-)

Well, not quite. But here are a few:

https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Cron/631/
https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Cron/633/


I'm seeing it a lot on PRs. If the test is broken and stopping work, and no culprit for rollback, I think we should {{@Ignore}} it and raise the priority of this ticket for reinstating it if it is important.

I tried bumping the timeout on each test case from 30 seconds to 60 seconds and it did not alleviate the issue.

Perhaps meaningfully, this test completes extremely quickly on my OSX laptop but times out (due to deadlock or race?) on my Linux desktop.

I've only tested the fix on MacOS and on Jenkins which also has Linux. Unfortunately, this test class is notorious for failures. I'll look into refactoring it to make it less prone to flakiness.

[~kenn] Taking this. Please consider testing the fix in the PR: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7138

Seems to be flaky again...reopening.

I think I just saw this flake again:

Thanks for reporting the failure. Will take a look.

[~bhulette] This should be fixed via https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8504.

Thanks for the  quick fix!
