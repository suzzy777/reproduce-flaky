This test has indeed historically been quite flaky.
If I remember correctly, the test was modified to test against multi-broker clusters due to it being flaky in the past, but apparently that didn't fully resolve things.

A few data points:
 * I double checked if the KafkaSource is doing anything special with the Kafka consumer in order for it to handle partition leader switches, and it isn't - leader switching is internal implementation details of the Kafka consumer client.
 * We already have an e2e exactly-once test with artificial failures within a Flink job.

All in all, it sounds like a good call to remove this flaky test as it's not really adding much value for test coverage.

Perhaps the only value that test gives us is "tests as proof/documentation" that the Kafka Source connector can continue to run as is in case of broker failures in a multi-broker setup. However, this does seem to be completely irrelevant to the connector code.
