IMPALA-2993: don't check for "Failed to allocate buffer for collection" error

This test query is supposed to check the error path for when a
collection buffer cannot be allocated. However, it's flaky because the
collection allocations are not very big (< 2KB), so it's possible for
a different operator to trigger OOM.

I think the correct solution is to create a test file that contains
very large collections, so a large collection allocation will trigger
OOM, rather than many small collection allocations. For now though,
let's disable the specific collection allocation check to unblock the
build, even though we risk losing coverage.
