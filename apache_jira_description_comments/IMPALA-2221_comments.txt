bq. Not clear how this is S3 related, but it only shows up for S3 right now.

Finally showed up on another job - see IMPALA-2583.

I won't be able to look at this anytime soon.

will impalad.get_num_in_flight_queries() return same result no matter which daemon this is?
or only coordinator return correct result?

    IMPALA-2221: Fix the flaky test test_shell_commands.test_queries_closed.
    
    The bug was that the test sometimes polled the wrong impalad for checking
    metrics because ImpaladCluster() does not guarantee any particular order of
    impalads, but the test was incorrectly relying on that.
    
    The fix is to execute the shell commands on a fixed impalad, and use the
    same impalad for polling metrics.
