This specific failure is not showing anymore on ci-cass and logs seem to be gone from circle. Still the CASTest package is showing similar errors for [other tests|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk-jvm-dtest/jdk=jdk_1.8_latest,label=cassandra/463/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test/CASTest/incompletePrepare/]. Worth taking a closer look imo, also notice the the accompanying GC memory errors which could be cause or consequence.

Any progress here [~blerer] or can I steal it?

I can get both this, CASSANDRA-16355 and an OOM often locally specially if the env is loaded. The test seem to be very time sensitive. Raising timeouts to 1s from the 200ms prevents failures but that neither pins down the root cause or clears suspicion of a bug.

In any case I have pushed a [wip branch|https://github.com/bereng/cassandra/commits/CASSANDRA-16317] with raised timeouts for convenience. I am closing this ticket as imo it should be folded under CASSANDRA-16355 which _seems_ (finger in the air) more serious than the timeout here probably pointing to a more serious matter and investigation over there.
