First cut at doing this.

Unit tests updated and pass, and tested out on a real live node.

interesting, lemme go over those tests.

Think I got the test failures in line. Ran as many tests as I could (was getting entirely unrelated failures, so not super confident, but HDFS stuff passed).

The 2.7 version of this cherry-pick is giving some very interesting problems than I'm digging into. Looks like it's trying to load block pools multiple times and failing.

I ran the FileSystemContract tests on my linux box and mac os x laptop and they both passed, chasing down the BPOfferService one.

Thanks a lot for working on this [~patrickwhite]. It looks good overall. Just a few minor issues

{code}
/**
   * Attempt to parse a storage uri with storage class and URI. The storage
   * class component of the uri is case-insensitive.
   *
   * @param rawLocation Location string of the format [type]uri, where [type] is
   *                    optional.
   * @return A List<StorageLocation> object if successfully parsed, null otherwise.
   *         Does not throw any exceptions.
   */
public static List<StorageLocation> parse(String rawLocation, FileSystem fs)
{code}

* Is this only used by the tests? How about change it to package level access and mark it as {{@VisibleForTesting}}. 
* Also, we should updates the comments a little bit.  For instance, it will throw {{IOE}} from {{fs.globStatus()}} and this function does not return {{null}}. 
* I feel that we can move the comments to the {{public static List<StorageLocation> parse(String rawLocation)}} function. 
* Should we also mention supporting wildcard in the comments?

{code}
    List<StorageLocation> locations = new ArrayList<StorageLocation>();
    List<String> stringLocations = new ArrayList<String>();
{code}

We can use Java7 feature here (i.e., {{=new ArrayList<>()}})

Thanks again!


Thanks [~eddyxu], I'm in agreement. I'll get started on the suggestions.

On the topic of TestBPOfferService... I have *no* idea what's going on with that. Apparently registerDatanode isn't getting called?

I've attached the {{mvn -Dtest=TestBPOfferService test}} output, the exceptions are on lines 82, 136/137, and 218. I'm having an exceptionally hard time figuring out why the {{bpThread}} object is null. Any suggestions or tricks of the trade for chasing that down?

Addressing [~eddyxu]'s comments.

[~patrickwhite] Have you tested {{TestBPOfferService}} on {{trunk}}?

Yes, {{TestBPOfferService}} works on trunk, does not work with my patch. I've been poking at it with IntelliJ all day, but I'm hitting the limits of my ability to debug threaded tests.

I've debugged my portion of the code, it works as expected during the tests. :(

There's nothing fishy in the test output relating to TestBPOfferService.testBasicFunctionality (Modified the tests to have currently tested methods in the output)

Ok, I officially don't get it.
{{mvn -q -Dtest=TestBPOfferService#testBasicFunctionality}} -> ok
{{mvn -q -Dtest=TestBPOfferService}} -> fail

Hi [~patrickwhite], likely one of the test cases in {{TestBPOfferService}} fails to clean up after itself so subsequent tests fail. One issue we used to see was failing to shut down the MiniDFSCluster. Junit now randomizes the execution order of individual test cases so that adds some debugging complexity but it also increases the chances of catching such spurious dependencies.

Your best bet would be code inspection of tests for incorrect cleanup.

I have a suspect, as there is duplicate initialization code in testBPInitErrorHandling. I'll start there. Thanks [~arpitagarwal]

Somethings messed up and I've lost the will to live for the day. After many hundreds of runs without change, it eventually ran fine. So I'm mentally marking this as a flaky test and I'll pick back up tomorrow.
