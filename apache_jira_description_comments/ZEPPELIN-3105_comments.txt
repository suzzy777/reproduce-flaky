It seems the issue was introduced with ZEPPELIN-3013

[~aweise] Would you mind to share your paragraph ? According the logs, it seems you are trying to run a blank paragraph. 

This happens with any *non*-blank paragraphs, e.g.

{noformat}
%sh
whoami
{noformat}

Reproduce steps:
- create new note
- fill a paragraph with any content 
- run the paragraph using the Rest API -> works fine
- restart zeppelin
- run the paragraph again using the Rest API -> *DOES NOT WORK*


[~zjffdu] Do you need more details here? Could you reproduce on your side?

    ZEPPELIN-3105 Notebook not running via REST API after Zeppelin Restart

    ### What is this PR for?
    Fixes regression introduced with [ZEPPELIN-3013](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3013). Executing Notebook and
    Paragraph via Rest API was not possible anymore, because some parsing
    was introduced paragraph.setText(...). The setter was not invoked after
    deserialization, thus paragraph.intpText and paragraph.scriptText was
    not set.
    
    This PR fixes that by introducing a PostJsonDeserProcessable interface,
    that can be used on any class implementing JsonSerializable, for implementing some routines to be invoked after deserialization. For
    enabling the interface, a corresponding TypeAdapterFactory must be
    registered on the GsonBuilder.
    
    Paragraph class now implements PostJsonDeserProcessable and parses
    intpText and scriptText variables properly after deserialization.
    
    Also a test was added, and AbstractTestRestApi.shutdown() method was
    overloaded to support the use case of not deleting the interpreter.json
    during server restart within one test case.

    @weand CI still fails, but very probably it is flaky test, but could you retrigger the CI ? I'd like make sure these failed test is not caused by this PR before merging.

    This time it failed here:

    the last time it failed at another line - 660:

    this seems quite flaky. Can not see, why the changes here break this test. Do you have any idea?

    I already have ipython + jupyter installed. Also Firefox 31 with Auto Update disabled.
    
    When starting zeppelin and a python notebook (created by the tests) manually, I get proper results inside Web GUI. I also see various zeppelin processes via ps aux. But the grep pipes used in the test doesn't cover them.
    
    Could anyone please assist, who can run the test properly. @soralee ?
