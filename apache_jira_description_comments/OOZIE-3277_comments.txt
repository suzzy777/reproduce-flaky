We can ignore the Jenkins {{@author}} warning, the patch only contains this string because it checks for the tag.

[~kmarton] Could you please add the possibility to recognise {{import *}} statements with leading spaces (or event tabs) like:
{noformat}
  import java.util.*;
{noformat}

Thank you [~asalamon74] for the review. I have uploaded a new patch, where the import statements with trailing spaces are also recognised.

Thank you [~kmarton] for the modification.

+1 (non-binding) pending Jenkins

Thanks for the contribution [~kmarton]! Can you please take care of the one line that is too long? Thanks!

[~andras.piros], the long line is the following one: 
{code:java}
longLines=$(grep "^+" "${PATCHFILE}" | grep -v "^+++" | awk 'BEGIN{count=0}{if ( length > 133 ) { count=count+1} }END{ print count}'){code}
This line is an old one, I have addressed a shell check issue, this is why is reported. However, I prefer to have it a little longer than splitted, because I consider it more readable this way.

Thanks for the explanation [~kmarton]! +1

Committed to {{master}}.

Closing issue; Oozie 5.2.0 is released
