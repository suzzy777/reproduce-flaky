Can you rebase this to more relevant commits (without reverts at least)?

rebased with cleaner history

I ran this by circle with the new tests repeated, and they seem have problems sometimes with vnodes under both [j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/970/workflows/5169200c-8c69-4b43-ad4b-fd4c7c49172c/jobs/20538/] and [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/970/workflows/c89aead7-4f97-48b3-bf76-623f8e50c950/jobs/20524/].

[~brandon.williams] thanks for running, I only ran with PAID, so guess there is some issue with FREE?

Heh, not a lot of details to go off of...

ok looks like timeouts if I download the xml... Ill look into this... I will see what I can do.. I was doing 10 requests for each CL for each instance in dc1... this is likely what is causing the test timeout

Heh, that was with PAID.  Indeed, they all look like timeouts to me.

Ah, thought PAID used higher the median, but see my build https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra/2029/workflows/994de63b-e82c-44e0-a2a2-6fa37dd3029c/jobs/23534/tests is the same.

Looking into the timeouts now

new patch looks to have no timeouts, but j11 had the following errors

Last 3 errors are from the test making sure that the sorting worked as expected.  Due to severity being set the decomming node should be last out of the set of 6, but It was second, which may lead to timeouts.

There are 2 cases I can think happened

1) test doesn't wait for gossip agreement to know every instance knows about severity
2) nodes compute weights using a scheduler, so may need to refresh before running tests

Ill try to look into improving both cases today

pushed a few test changes to hopefully get more stable

1) set severity to 10k so latencies don't really matter
2) block waiting for whole cluster to see severity change
3) make sure to trigger updateScores before any queries run

Running CI again

Tests were still flaky, so added logic to avoid issues
