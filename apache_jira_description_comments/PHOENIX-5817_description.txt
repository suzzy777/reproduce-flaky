The prepatch script assumes that it is the only test on a machine, and kills other copies of itself, as well as unrelated maven tests runs.

Looking at the times, it's obvious that 
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-PHOENIX-Build/3712/ 
was killed by 
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-PHOENIX-Build/3713/ 

What's worse, it also kills ANY maven surefire/failsafe process, so not only does it sabotage other copies of itself, it also sabotages other projects' tests that share the ASF infrastructure.
