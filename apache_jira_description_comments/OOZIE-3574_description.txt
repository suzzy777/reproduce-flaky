Code is [here|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/9c288fe5cea6f2fbbae76f720b9e215acdd07709/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/JavaActionExecutor.java#L734].

If actionlibPath scheme is different from appPath (like actionLibPath's scheme is s3a, but the appPath is hdfs), this will fail to execute {{fs.exist(actionLibsPath)}}. So i think Oozie should create fileSystem by actionLibsPath.
