{{TestSpeculativeExecutionWithMRApp.testSpeculateSuccessfulWithUpdateEvents}} fails Intermittently with the exponential estimator. The problem happens because assertion fails waiting for the MRApp to stop.
There maybe a need to redesign the test case because it does not work very well because of the racing and the timing between the speculator and the tasks. It works fine for the legacy estimator because the estimate is based on start-end rate.
