The RPC client has a default timeout set to 0 when no timeout is passed in. This means that the network connection created will not timeout when used to write data. The issue has shown in YARN-2578 and HDFS-4858. Timeouts for writes then fall back to the tcp level retry (configured via tcp_retries2) and timeouts between the 15-30 minutes. Which is too long for a default behaviour.

Using 0 as the default value for timeout is incorrect. We should use a sane value for the timeout and the "ipc.ping.interval" configuration value is a logical choice for it. The default behaviour should be changed from 0 to the value read for the ping interval from the Configuration.

Fixing it in common makes more sense than finding and changing all other points in the code that do not pass in a timeout.
