PROBLEM

For now each server-node returns all response records to the client-node and it may contain ~thousands, ~hundred thousands records.
 Event if we need only first 10-100. Again, all the results are added to queue in _*GridCacheQueryFutureAdapter*_ in arbitrary order by pages.
 There are no any means to deliver deterministic result.

SOLUTION
 Implement _*limit*_ as parameter for _*TextQuery*_ and _*GridCacheQueryRequest*_ 
 It should be passed as limit  parameter in Lucene's  _*IndexSearcher.search()*_ in _*GridLuceneIndex*_.

For distributed queries _*limit*_ will also trim response queue when merging results.

Type: long
 Special value: : 0 -> No limit (Integer.MAX_VALUE);
