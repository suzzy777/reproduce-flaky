Fixed the following failure: https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/Spark-1.3-Maven-pre-YARN/hadoop.version=1.0.4,label=centos/452/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.broadcast/BroadcastSuite/Unpersisting_HttpBroadcast_on_executors_and_driver_in_distributed_mode/

The tests should wait until all slaves are up. Otherwise, there may be only a part of {{BlockManager}}s registered, and fail the tests.
