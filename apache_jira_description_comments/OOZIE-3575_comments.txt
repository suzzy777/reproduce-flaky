The recently opened OOZIE-3574 is actually a bug, but its strongly connecting to OOZIE-3575

Maybe we need a bigger jira to adapt to other file systems, this jira is just one of the subtasks. :P

Thanks for the contribution [~matijhs]! The patch looks good overall.
I don't have the time to test it out on real kerberized clusters with distcp. Can you please explain the scenarios that you've tested with?

The unit test failure looks suspicious, I retriggered the precommit.

Thanks [~asalamon74] and [~gezapeti]! I dont like this test failure either, trying to address it with a new patch. Still running some tests for each scenarios, I will update with the results.

Thanks for fixing the flakiness! I can't wait for the test results! :)

Prerequisite oozie-site config changes:
{code:java}
'oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.supported.filesystems': '*'
'oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.nameNode.whitelist': ''
{code}

Added s3a filesystem credentials to a simple distcp workflow:
{code:xml}
    <credentials>
          <credential name='s3a_cred' type='filesystem'>
                  <property>
                          <name>filesystem.path</name>
                          <value>${my_s3a_bucket}</value>
                  </property>
          </credential>
    </credentials>
    <action name="distcp-node" cred='s3a_cred'>
        <distcp xmlns="uri:oozie:distcp-action:1.0">
            <resource-manager>${resourceManager}</resource-manager>
            <name-node>${nameNode}</name-node>
            <prepare>
                <delete path="${outputDir}"/>
            </prepare>
            <arg>-update</arg>
            <arg>-skipcrccheck</arg>
            <arg>${basePath}/${inputDir}/data.txt</arg>
            <arg>${basePath}/${outputDir}/data.txt</arg>
            </distcp>
        <ok to="end"/>
        <error to="fail"/>
    </action>
{code}

----
The following scenarios were tested:
* workflow.xml: s3a, basePath: s3a
* workflow.xml: s3a, basePath: HDFS
* workflow.xml: HDFS, basePath: s3a - extra filesystem credentials only needed in this case

Sounds great! 
+1 then
