Now we exclue TestC* and TestM* -- we have excluded thos tests and started with TestEndToEndAckFailureRecovery.

I found that to reproduce the problem, you have to have forkMode set to "always" or "never".  If it's set to "once", the problem goes away.  Also, the problem only occurs when there is a comma in the list of excludes.

Fixed in [r1175098|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1175098].

The reason that "once" worked but not "always" and "never", is because forking "once" uses the directory scanner after the list of excludes is split and put into a properties file and then read back in as separate elements.  "always" and "never" use the list of excludes without splitting the elements with a comma, and the plexus utils scanner couldn't deal with elements with a comma in them.
