Added {{@Ignore}} for now at r1877987.

Hi [~adulceanu],

i can not reproduce the issue on my side, but I had conversation wiht [~ngupta] who could reproduce it.
Seems that problem is because in test, mock instrumentation happens after setting mocked object using reflection. 

Setting object after it has been instrumented, seems to resolve this issue. Change is in patch below.

[^OAK-9086.patch] 


Thanks for the contribution, [~smiroslav]!

After applying the fix the test consistently passed on my machine.

Fixed in trunk at r1878500.
