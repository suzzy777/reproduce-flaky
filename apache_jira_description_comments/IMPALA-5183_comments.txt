Weird. This has been in there for quite a while and we haven't seen it fail before. Maybe there was a slow disk or some kind of load on the system. Maybe just need to bump the timeout.



IMPALA-5183: increase write wait timeout in BufferedBlockMgrTest

The timeout was set low enough that some kind of hardware/system
hiccup had a reasonable chance of causing occasional failures.
Bumped it to 10s - that should only fail if something is seriously
wrong.
