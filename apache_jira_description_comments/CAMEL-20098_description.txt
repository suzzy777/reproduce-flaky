I have seen this a few times
https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Camel/job/Camel%20JDK21/job/main/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.apache.camel.support.jsse/KeyManagersParametersTest/testPropertyPlaceholders/

I suspect its due to AbstractJsseParametersTest is used by other tests and it may be concurrently in use, and this class creates a hardcoded file with configuration: file:./target/jsse-test.properties

So maybe we need to make this file dynamic or run the tests in isolation.
