Update tomcat-servlet-api to newer version (at least 8.0.52,  8.5.31+ or 9.0.9+). E.g. to
{noformat}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>
    <artifactId>tomcat-servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>9.0.10</version>
</dependency>
{noformat}

At least Ignite-rest-http, ignite-urideploy, and ignite-web will be affected by this change.

It is required to run TC tartget RunAll to check all tests passed, it is required to build fabric using DEVNOTES.txt to make sure full build will be successfull

Probably it is required to run release step to make sure release candidate can be prepared.
