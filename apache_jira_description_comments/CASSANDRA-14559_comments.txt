[~dcapwell] [~Bereng] would any of you mind to go over this? thanks!

dtest [https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Cassandra-devbranch/detail/Cassandra-devbranch/225/pipeline/256/]

failed dtests unrelated to this change: [https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Cassandra-devbranch/detail/Cassandra-devbranch/225/tests]

dtests were executed against dtest PR / personal dtest respository.

+1, but is there no reason to also fix this in all the lower branches as well?

I can check 3.0 but I am not sure if the logic is same. The original author of that patch was targetting only 3.11 and I found that the code is same in trunk but it might significantly differ in 3.0 though. Ill check.

PR for branch 3.0

[~brandon.williams] [~stefan.miklosovic] this test fails on trunk, can you, please, check it?

Ticket was raised for it - CASSANDRA-16030
