The :babel:fmppMain and :server:fmppMain tasks currently do not work with remote build caching.

One of the inputs is a directory and currently it's configured to look at the absolute path instead of the relative path. This causes different input hashes to be computed on different machines, hence the tasks do not work correctly with remote build caching.

I am attaching screenshots from the build scan analysis showing this.
