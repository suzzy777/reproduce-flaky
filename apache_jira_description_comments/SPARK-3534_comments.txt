Looks like this has been proposed before: SPARK-1455

Ah, yeah.  Good catch Josh.  I'll settle for a simpler version where we only fix SQL (since that is where the pain is being felt now).  Bonus points for implementing the full solution :)

[~marmbrus] - If you just want to run all the SQL tests, what Maven or {{sbt}} command would you run?

sbt/sbt -Phive catalyst/test sql/test hive/test
