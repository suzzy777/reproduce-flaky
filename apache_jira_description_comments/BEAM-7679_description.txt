Code is:
{code:java}
unique_dataset_name = dataset_base_name + str(int(time.time()))

{code}

I suspect this issue because of this error:
{code:java}
google.api_core.exceptions.NotFound: 404 Not found: Table apache-beam-testing:leader_board_it_dataset1562016299.leader_board_teams was not found in location US{code}
and the fact that a lot of such tests started at the same second.
