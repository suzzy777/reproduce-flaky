Patch 001 has been tested on a real cluster:
* MapReduce action failing
* MapReduce action passing
* Spark action in {{yarn-client}} mode failing
* Spark action in {{yarn-client}} mode passing
* Spark action in {{yarn-cluster}} mode failing
* Spark action in {{yarn-cluster}} mode passing
* Shell action failing
* Shell action passing

All the above delivered correct workflow and action status on Oozie side.

[~asasvari] can you please review? Thanks!

[~andras.piros] thanks for the patch! Can you add a new test case that validates the changes? TestMapReduceMain perhaps?

[~asasvari] here you go. *Please do not merge yet.*

[~asasvari] [~pbacsko] please note that I could find no proper way of actually getting MapReduce to start a new job while using {{OozieClient#submit()}} - apparently no YARN child application is created. Please advise what's the best way to advance, maybe call {{JobClient#submitJob()}} directly from {{ActionExecutorTestCase#startWorkflowAndFailChildMRJob()}}?

Can you file a reviewboard request?

[~asasvari] sure thing, [*here u go*|https://reviews.apache.org/r/68237/].

Changes in patch 004:
* removed new test inside {{TestJavaActionExecutor}}
* {{JavaActionExecutor#findEffectiveYarnApplicationId()}} now falls back to looking for an available YARN child application that isn't the launcher via {{YarnClient#getApplications()}} in case there is still no {{action-data.seq}} written by {{LauncherMain}} at the end of the MapReduce action
* {{TestMapReduceActionExecutor#startWorkflowAndFailChildMRJob()}} now waits until a real YARN child that isn't the Oozie Launcher appears

The test {{TestMapReduceActionExecutor#testFailingMapReduceJobCausesOozieLauncherAMToFail()}} fails locally. [~pbacsko] can you please look at the code and advise what do I have to change?

Patch 005 addresses following:
* {{JavaActionExecutor#findYarnApplicationId()}} contains the original implementation only
* {{MapReduceActionExecutor#findYarnApplication()}} contains the modified implementation in three stages:
** based on {{action-data.seq}} written by {{MapReduceMain}}, if already present
** if not found, look up the appropriate YARN child ID
** if not found, go with {{WorkflowAction#getExternalId()}}
* new functionality is extracted into the nested classes {{MapReduceActionExecutor$HadoopJobIdFinder}} and {{MapReduceActionExecutor$YarnApplicationIdFinder}} for better readability, single responsibility, and testability
* {{TestYarnApplicationIdFinder}} covers important parts of the new functionality

Tested both using JUnit and on a real cluster, the patch now looks promising. [~pbacsko] [~asasvari] can you please review? Thanks!

Changes:
* the class {{YarnApplicationIdComparator}} now considers also {{ApplicationId}} instances with different cluster timestamps as different
* refactored {{MapReduceActionExecutor$YarnApplicationIdFinder#fallbackToYarnChildOrExternalId()}} not to call {{YarnClient#getApplications()}} directly because of performance issues on a busy cluster. Instead, call {{LauncherMain#getChildYarnApplications()}} that calls {{ClientRMProxy#getApplications(GetApplicationRequest request)}} instead, for better filtering options. This way, performance doesn't suffer even on busy YARN clusters
