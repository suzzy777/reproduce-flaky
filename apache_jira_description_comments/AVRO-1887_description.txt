The lack of automated checks for things like doing a full build is negatively impacting my ability to do timely reviews. We should leverage the work done by other communities and get precommit checks going with Apache Yetus ([ref Apache Yetus Precommit|http://yetus.apache.org/documentation/0.3.0/precommit-basic/])

Yetus has built in support for using Docker as a containerized build environment ([ref docs|https://yetus.apache.org/documentation/0.3.0/precommit-advanced/#Docker_Support]), but I don't know if we can use the one we have directly or if we'll need to do some refactoring.

Implementing this will ultimately require a committer (so that they can make changes to builds.apache.org), but a non-cmmitter can get the bulk of the work done by managing to do local yetus checks with the docker feature active.
