When creating the read commands _after_ setting {{gcgs}}, the {{nowInSeconds}} wasn't being bumped far enough. It was only adding 1 to the value used for the inserts. This could lead to a race where occasionally a tombstone was not yet purgable. Fixed by bumping it a full 60s as in the other similar tests. No failures seen running this 200 times locally.

Do wish we could control time more though.
