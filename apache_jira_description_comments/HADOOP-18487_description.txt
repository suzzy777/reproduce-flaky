uses of protobuf 2.5 and RpcEnginej have been deprecated since 3.3.0 in HADOOP-17046

while still keeping those files around (for a long time...), how about we make the protobuf 2.5.0 export off hadoop common and hadoop-hdfs *provided*, rather than *compile*

that way, if apps want it for their own apis, they have to explicitly ask for it, but at least our own scans don't break.

i have no idea what will happen to the rest of the stack at this point, it will be "interesting" to see
