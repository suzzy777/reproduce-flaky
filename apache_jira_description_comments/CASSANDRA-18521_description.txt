It has been [mentioned|https://github.com/maedhroz/cassandra/pull/11#discussion_r1190166765] in CASSANDRA-18217 that {{CQLTester#waitForIndex}} and {{SAITester#waitForIndexQueryable}} can be unified into a single method. 

The same discussion mentions that it's easy to forget to call those methods after calling {{CQLTester#createIndex}}. So that method can be renamed to {{createIndexAsync}}, and we can create a new method that creates the index and waits for it ({{createIndexSync}}, {{createIndexAndWaitForQueryable}}, or something like that).
