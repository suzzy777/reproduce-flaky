GEODE-5637: move SingleHopClientExecutorSubmitTaskWithExceptionTest to integrationTest

* Increase Awaitility timeout due to flaky failure
* Cleanup test and use AssertJ


This test is super flaky and seems to consistently fail on Windows. It's trying to use SystemErrRule to test logging which doesn't really work very well. I think the test needs to be rewritten with a Log4J2 Appender instead of trying to use stdout or stderr. I'm going to disable it with Ignore until I can get this rewritten.

SingleHopClientExecutorSubmitTaskWithExceptionTest  was renamed as SingleHopClientExecutorWithLoggingIntegrationTest.

Geode currently manipulates Log4J2 at runtime to add/remove Appenders based on the Cache lifecycle. Sai and I tried to add ListAppender [1] from log4j-core test-jar programmatically at runtime using the same code that Geode uses for ConsoleAppender and LogWriterAppender. Unfortunately, this behavior seems to either never have worked completely or was broken by one of the Log4J2 dependency upgrades over the last couple years.

In my opinion, it doesn't make sense to continue in this direction. GEODE-2644 describes an alternate approach which would be easier to maintain and more user-friendly in the long-run, so I'm planning to change the Geode appenders as described by GEODE-2644 and then add debug functionality to the Geode appenders which tests such as this can use for easier testing.

This issue has either failed to reproduce or been fixed systemically elsewhere (e.g. improving port selection and timeouts).  Closing but please reopen if needed.

Revert GEODE-2644 because offline diskstore commands generate info level logs

GFSH forks the offline diskstore commands in a JVM using log4j2-cli.xml
which sets the log level to WARN. However, the forked JVM creates a
Cache which then starts generating info level statements to STDOUT.
