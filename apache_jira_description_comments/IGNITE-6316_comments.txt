    IGNITE-6316 StoredCacheData persistence fix

----


[~agoncharuk], could you please take a look?

As the original test was broken, we need to make sure the following cases are covered:
1) A node is restarted, but the cluster lives. In this case, the locally stored configuration should be overridded by the cluster configuration
2) The configuration is altered, then the cluster is restarted. In this case, the configuration should be loaded from disk.

Otherwise looks good

[~agoncharuk], [~al.psc], thanks! Makes sense to me - we need to add these two tests before patch is accepted.

[~al.psc], my comments:
1) Test for static config looks wrong to me - it confirms incorrect behavior (changed config is overwritten with static config). This test should fail, not pass.
2) I see some suspicious hangs in test suites, let's clear them
3) The most important - changes are in core classes, so full set of tests should be executed

[~vozerov]
1. When configuration is read from serialized {{StoredCacheData}}, it leads to an usual attempt to create cache. But, in this case, we already do have cache with same name in static configuration. And because we do, current internals logic ignores attempts to create caches with existing names. So this behavior is consistent with current state of things. However, it's doubtful whether such behavior is still correct since PDS has been introduced. Still, I believe it'd be more correct to fix this behavior in scope of a different issue/release.
2. All test failures I see are from flaky tests that fail in other branches too.
3. New clear re-run of all tests is on its way.
