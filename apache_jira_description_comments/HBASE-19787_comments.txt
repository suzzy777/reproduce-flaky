Here is changeset note:


    HBASE-19787 Fix or disable tests broken in branch-2 so can cut beta-1

    M dev-support/make_rc.sh
      Disable checkstyle building site. Its an issue being fixed over in HBASE-19780

    M hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/master/HMaster.java
      The clusterid was being set into the process only after the
      regionserver registers with the Master. That can be too late for some
      test clients in particular. e.g. TestZKAsyncRegistry needs it as soon
      as it goes to run which could be before Master had called its run
      method  which is regionserver run method which then calls back to the
      master to register itself... and only then do we set the clusterid.
      HBASE-19694 changed start order which made it so this test failed.
      Setting the clusterid right after we set it in zk makes the test pass.

      Another change was that backup masters were not going down on stop.
      Backup masters were sleeping for the default zk period which is 90
      seconds. They were not being woken up to check for stop. On stop
      master now tells active master manager.

    M hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/TestJMXConnectorServer.java
      Prevent creation of acl table. Messes up our being able to go down
      promptly.

    M hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/master/balancer/TestRegionsOnMasterOptions.java
    M hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/TestMultiParallel.java
    M hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/regionserver/TestRegionServerReadRequestMetrics.java
      Disabled for now because it wants to run with regions on the Master...
      currently broke!

    M hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/TestZKAsyncRegistry.java
      Add a bit of debugging.

    M hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/master/TestDLSAsyncFSWAL.java
      Disabled. Fails 40% of the time.

    M hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/master/TestDLSFSHLog.java
      Disabled. Fails 33% of the time.

    Disabled stochastic load balancer for favored nodes because it fails on
    occasion and we are not doing favored nodes in branch-2.


Filing follow-on issues.

Added note over on HBASE-19554 that I disabled the WAL tests for now. Added issue HBASE-19788 to reenable TestFavoredNodesStochasticBalancer.

Pushed to master and branch-2.
