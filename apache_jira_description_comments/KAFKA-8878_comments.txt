   The previous approach to testing KAFKA-8412 was to look at the logs and
   determine if an error occurred during close. There was no direct way to
   detect than an exception occurred because the exception was eaten in
   `AssignedTasks.close`. In the PR for that ticket (#7207) it was
   acknowledged that this was a brittle way to test for the exception. We
   now see occasional failures because an unrelated ERROR level log entry
   is made while closing the task.
   
   This change eliminates the brittle log checking by rethrowing any time
   an exception occurs in close, even when a subsequent unclean close
   succeeds. This has the potential benefit of uncovering other supressed
   exceptions down the road.
   
   I've verified that even with us rethrowing on `closeUnclean` that all
   tests pass.
