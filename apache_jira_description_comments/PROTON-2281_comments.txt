PROTON-2281 Fix flakiness in ruby-message-spec test

   I strongly dislike using random numbers in tests in this particular manner. I'd have much preferred doing a simple
   
   ```ruby
   @message.ttl = -1
   ```
   
   That would be a perfectly clear an understandable test for this boundary condition, in my view.
   
   However, this is not something I am ready to go on a crusade about, at least not right now.

The cause was found by [~jross@redhat.com]. The test is using random numbers and it can sometimes pass in a zero, due to incorrectly specified range. That is not a negative number, so no exception is then thrown.
