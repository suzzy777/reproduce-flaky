It seems that it still doesn't reproduce with 10K iterations in the multiplexer:
 * 4.0: [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/3196/workflows/5a0dd468-8ff1-4af2-acc2-84900fbcff29]
 * trunk: [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/3197/workflows/ad967712-974c-4742-93d6-361caea11bcb]

The last reproduction in Jenkins is from [Aug 24|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1685/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.db/ImportTest/testImportInvalidateCache_compression_jdk11/] for trunk, a particularly bad run. So it's either a Jenkins-only failure, as it was when first reported, or it has recently been fixed.

I saw it today here in a run with very few failures on trunk - [https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1706/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.db/ImportTest/testImportInvalidateCache_cdc_jdk17/]

It seems that it is more of a Jenkins "thing"
