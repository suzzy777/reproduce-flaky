Hi,[~dionusos], Do you try add “file://”  or “hdfs://” prefix？

Hallo [~nobigo],
thanks for your answer. We tried hdfs://, I've just extended the description. This fails too.

Hi,[~dionusos], I tried add file tag right address "hdfs:///var/log/nobigo/property.yml#property.yml" in my workflow file. It succeed.

I add wrong address "hdfs:///var/log/nobigo/property.yml1#property.yml".It failed. It shows: JA008:file doies not exist.

I use new Oozie code compile oozie-5.2.0-SNAPSHOT.

[~nobigo] have you used spark 1 or spark 2? Can you please share the Hadoop version too? Thanks

cc [~Hari Matta]

Hi,[~dionusos],I use hadoop version 2.6.5  and Spark version . 2.1.0. May be because version different.

I've updated the environment info:
HDP 2.6.5, Hadoop 2.7.3 and Spark 2 . 2.3.0 . Oozie parameters the Spark command's --files option with the "%23" contained string. This can be reproduces using unit tests.

[~nobigo] Can you please test the patch uploaded by [~dionusos]. Is your {{hdfs:///var/log/nobigo/property.yml#property.yml}} example still works after the modification?
