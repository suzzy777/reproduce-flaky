We currently have {{Status::Abort()}} which gives an easy way to abort the process with a meaningful message and detail.

We should similarly add {{Status::Warn()}} that would simply print a warning message of the error. Possible example use at https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13315/files#diff-1256864b34a1b43082596ab5b16881702881ad06be8e1c157b47e1e6ac9ff5d2R160-R164 (together with {{StatusFromErrno}}).
