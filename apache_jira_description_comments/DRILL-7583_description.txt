The original error solution was a complex process of a) setting a failed flag, b) telling all upstream operators they have failed, c) returning a {{STOP}} status.  Drill has long supported a "fail-fast" error path based on throwing an exception; relying on the fragment executor to clean up the operator stack. Recent revisions have converted most operators to use the simpler fail-fast strategy based on throwing an exception instead of using the older {{STOP}} approach. This change simply removes the old, now-unused {{STOP}} based path.
