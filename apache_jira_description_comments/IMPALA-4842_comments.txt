Looks like a duplicate of IMPALA-4781.  [~jbapple] were we confident that IMPALA-4781 was an infra issue instead of a test issue?

I don't think this is directly connected to ASAN - I've run this test under ASAN quite a few times recently.

[~tarmstrong], no I was not confident.

On some of the Jenkins jobs on <http://jenkins.impala.io:8080> that have failed with low disk space, I added a trap to the bash script to print df -m on exit, so that even if the machine is ephemeral and goes away, the log can help debug disk space issues.

I have now seen this with a non-ASAN build. It was in an "exhaustive" build, but it my understanding that the test exploration strategy does not change the BE tests.

I think the problem is that the test needs to be more permissive in the errors it accepts at that point.

I pushed out a fix here: http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/5940 that should solve the issue. I may not have time to get this merged before I am on holiday for a couple of weeks so I'll probably have to hand this off to someone.

I have a fix posted but won't have time to see it through to completion before going on break. I'll turn this over to you Dan since it would be good to get this in to avoid build breakage.

    IMPALA-4842: BufferedBlockMgrTest.WriteError is flaky

    The test should allow Unpin() to fail with a scratch allocation error to
    handle the case where the first write fails and blacklists the scratch
    disk around the same time that the second write starts. Usually either
    the second write succeeds because it started before the first write
    failed or it fails with CANCELLED because the
    BufferedBlockMgr::is_cancelled_ flag is set. There is a small
    window for a race after the disk is blacklisted in TmpFileMgr but
    before BufferedBlockMgr::WriteComplete() is called.

    Testing:
    I was able to reproduce the problem locally by adding some delays
    to the test. I added a variant of the WriteError test that more reliably
    reproduces the bug. Ran both WriteError tests in a loop locally to try
    to flush out flakiness.
