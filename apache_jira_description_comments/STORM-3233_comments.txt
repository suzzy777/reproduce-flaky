Thanks [~michallo],

 

I merged this into master, branch-1.x and branch-1.1.x. Keep up the good work.

FYI we just found https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3156 with the 3.4.13 version of the ZK client.  This is a blocker for many setups secured by kerberos.  I think we might need to revert this change until we can get the zookeeper client fixed.

Hi [~revans2],

What a pity. But I agree that it's a must in that situation. Should I create revert pull requests or you can revert this yourself? 

Need to revert this so we can wait for 3.4.14

Now zookeeper 3.4.14 is out, this could be revisited

Yes. Feel free to raise new PRs, we can probably get it in before a new round of RCs for Storm.

Raised PRs, apologies if I've got any of this wrong, it's the first time I've raised a github PR.For some reason #2987 doesn't seem to of appeared above, so maybe I've gotten some part of it wrong. Think I got the title wrong (missed a slash). Have changed it, Looks like it's been picked up now.

Thanks [~pacham7], merged the PRs.

[~ptgoetz] Isn't the next version of 1.x 1.2.3, and not 1.2.4?

[~Srdo] yep. I'll revert and do another RC tomorrow.
