IMPALA-9625: Convert the name of a TAccessEvent to lowercase

Impala's COMPUTE STATS statement results in two registrations of the
ALTER event for the corresponding table identified by its
fully-qualified table name and a Set is used to maintained the audits.
The first registration is in Analyzer#registerAuthAndAuditEvent() and
the second is in Analyzer#getTable().

In registerAuthAndAuditEvent(), the corresponding full table name
table.getFullName() is produced by a call to Analyzer#resolveTableRef().
The resulting database and table names are both in lowercase.

However, in getTable(), the fully-qualified table name is produced by a
call to Analyzer#getFqTableName(). The resulting database and table
names are in their originally unconverted form provided by the user from
the Impala shell. Hence, there is no guarantee that the database and
table names are both in lowercase.

Therefore, if a user does not provide lowercase database and table
names, the returned full table names from registerAuthAndAuditEvent()
and getTable() would differ, resulting in duplicate ALTER events for the
same table. This patch resolves the inconsistencies by converting the
name of a TAccessEvent to lowercase in addAccessEvent(), which is called
in getTable().

Testing:
- Revised a FE test to verified we do not have duplicate ALTER events for
  the COMPUTE STATS statement.
- Verified that the patch passes the exhaustive tests in the DEBUG build
  except for a flaky E2E test of test_column_storage_attributes.

IMPALA-9977: Remove duplicate Ranger audit log entries for ALTER events

This JIRA could be considered as a follow-up to IMPALA-9625, where we
converted the name of a TAccessEvent to lowercase to avoid duplicate
audits in the Set used to maintain the collected TAccessEvent's so that
there will not be duplicate TAccessEvent's in the file specified by the
flag of "-audit_event_log_dir" when Impala is started.

However, the patch for IMPALA-9625 only considered the audits that are
exported to the specific file mentioned above but not the
PrivilegeRequest's that will be processed by Ranger which in turn would
produce the corresponding audit log entries. Therefore, the
fully-qualified table name that is provided when
Analyzer#registerPrivReq() is called in Analyzer#getTable() is not
necessarily in lowercase, resulting in duplicate AuthzAuditEvent's
stored in the corresponding RangerBufferAuditHandler because the
full table names returned from registerAuthAndAuditEvent() and
getTable() differ. Refer to IMPALA-9625 for more details.

To resolve the inconsistencies, this patch converts the arguments of
database and table names to lowercase when
PrivilegeRequestBuilder#onTable() is building the corresponding
PrivilegeRequest, which will later be added to the Set of
PrivilegeRequest's for Ranger to process.

Testing:
- Added an FE test in RangerAuditLogTest.java to make sure no duplicate
  Ranger audit log entries are produced.
- Verified that the patch passes the exhaustive tests in the DEBUG
  build.
