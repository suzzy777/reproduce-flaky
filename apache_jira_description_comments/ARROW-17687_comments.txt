I got this [^backtrace.log.cpp].

It seems we are moving the unique_locker and trying to lock some invalid mutex.

Also, I was able to get another issue, this time a deadlock using these values:
{code:java}
constexpr int kNumIters = 1;
constexpr int kNumFragments = 10;
constexpr int kBatchesPerFragment = 10;
constexpr int kNumConcurrentTasks = 2;{code}
I'll try to explore more about where we are getting these errors, so far I was able to reduce and reproduce the test issue using these values:
{code:java}
constexpr int kNumIters = 1;
constexpr int kNumFragments = 2;
constexpr int kBatchesPerFragment = 1;
constexpr int kNumConcurrentTasks = 1;{code}
Given that we can use C++ 17 now, I'll try to use the new std::scoped_lock instead of the other lockers (in the places where it make sense to do so)

[~westonpace] I marked this as blocker because we would like such crashiness issues to be solved before 10.0.0.
