Currently processing time timers ignore the outputTimestamp and instead use the input watermark at the time they fire.Â  This is wrong because the input watermark can have advanced arbitrarily far past the actual output timestamp when it fires.

The correct behavior should be to instead use the outputTimestamp the timer was configured to fire with.
