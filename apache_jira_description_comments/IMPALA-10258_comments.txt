Assign this to [~stakiar] first since this seems similar to IMPALA-9550. Feel free to reassign it to me. Thanks!

This issue did not appear anymore since last time reported.
Tried to loop-run this test case for 1000 times with latest master branch, but could not reproduce the issue.

Resolving this Jira as "Cannot Reproduce" now. 

According to the back trace, the test was waiting for the query to reach state "RUNNING" (QueryState = 3, see beeswax.thrift), but it was already at state "EXCEPTION" (QueryState = 5). At that point in the test, the query shouldn't have failed, since the query was not cancelled yet, so really not sure what could have happened.
