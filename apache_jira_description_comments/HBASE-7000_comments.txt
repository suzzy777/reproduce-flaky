there're two choices here.
1 attached file shows change to some value not the old Integer.MAX_VALUE

2 modify KeyValue.javaï¼Œ remove the following code:
    if (vlength > HConstants.MAXIMUM_VALUE_LENGTH) { // FindBugs INT_VACUOUS_COMPARISON
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Value length " + vlength + " > " +
          HConstants.MAXIMUM_VALUE_LENGTH);
    }

IMHO, the HConstants.MAXIMUM_VALUE_LENGTH maybe changed in future, so the check statement should be always be there for safety

BTW, the WARING was caused by :
an integer comparison(vlength > Integer.MAX_VALUE) that always returns the same value

patch looks good.
nit: insert space before 1:

The two failed tests are flaky.
