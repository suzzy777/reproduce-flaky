Because of the subdirectory server used in {{hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/proto/server/yarn_security_token.proto}} there are errors in other protos that include them.
As per the docs http://sergei-ivanov.github.io/maven-protoc-plugin/usage.html {noformat} Any subdirectories under src/main/proto/ are treated as package structure for protobuf definition imports.{noformat}
