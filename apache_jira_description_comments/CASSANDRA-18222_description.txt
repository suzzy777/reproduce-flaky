The accord integration tests are currently flaky due to Preempt happening (we convert that to a timeout).  We need to address this to make sure the tests are stable.

One solution may be make SimpleProgressLog’s frequency run different for jvm-dtest (likely to depend on CASSANDRA-18221 ), this would be similar to what we already do as timeouts maybe larger in jvm-dtest due to the extra complexity running multiple processes in the same JVM.  Another solution may be to have the client coordinator “attach” to the new coordinator, this would avoid the user being impacted by this preempt when the coordinator is healthy.
