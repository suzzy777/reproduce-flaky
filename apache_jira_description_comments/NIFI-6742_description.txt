DBCPServiceTest.java leaves a test file called `test.mv.db` in the home directory when building NiFi.  This is an H2 database file which should ideally be cleaned up after building.

Recommend using a JUnit TemporaryFolder or a maven target directory which would enable more automatic cleanup of the temporary file.

There are two references in the unit test to this H2 database file at lines:  360, 408
