Is there a timeline on when 3.7.1 or 3.8.0 will be availabe? thanks. 

Hi [~ztzg],

Any update on when 3.7.1 will be available? This finding has been opened for some time on our security scans, and our stakeholders are inquiring on them. Thanks.

Hi [~danielma-2020],

No idea—but 3.8.0 might get there first. See this recent discussion on the {{-dev}} mailing list:

(I am afraid I cannot volunteer at this point, as I am already overloaded by other obligations.)

HTH, -D
