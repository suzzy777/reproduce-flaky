Testing infra improvements
- Exclude flaky tests from nightly master run (Old nightly master run used to exclude flaky tests, but new nightly one which is based on Jenkins stages wasn't using it. Adding it to new nightly job)
- Fixes findbugs check (seems like wasn't working earlier : "0	findbugs	0m 0s	Findbugs executables are not available.")
