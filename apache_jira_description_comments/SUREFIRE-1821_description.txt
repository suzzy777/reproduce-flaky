*Description:*

When using *parallel* configuration with *rerunFailingTestsCount* bad xml report is generated for a failing test.

*How to reproduce:*

1. Configure forkCount, parallel and rerun count:
{code:java}
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0-M5</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>test</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  <configuration>
    <rerunFailingTestsCount>1</rerunFailingTestsCount>
    <forkCount>1</forkCount>
    <threadCount>1</threadCount>
    <parallel>all</parallel>
    <redirectTestOutputToFile>true</redirectTestOutputToFile>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
{code}
2. Create a failing test that outputs more than 1m characters:
{code:java}
public class AppTest {
    @Test
    public void testBug() {
        for(int i = 0;  i < 100000; i++){
            System.out.println("Some output longer than 10 character");
        }
        throw new NullPointerException();
    }
}
{code}
3. Run the test and check the report - you will see unexpected end of xml file:
{code:java}
    ...
    <property name="sun.io.unicode.encoding" value="UnicodeBig"/>
    <property name="java.class.version" value="52.0"/>
  </properties>
  <testcase name="testBug" classname="com.mycompany.app.AppTest" time="0.015">
    <error type="java.lang.NullPointerException"><![CDATA[java.lang.NullPointerException
        at com.mycompany.app.AppTest.testBug(AppTest.java:12)
]]></error>
    <system-out><![CDATA[  <-- EOF
{code}
*Possible cause:*

It seems that Junit 4.7 Runner considers each rerun as a separate test set, so sends _testSetCompleted_ event each time, but after the first event _DeferredFileOutputStream_ and associated with it temp file gets freed(deleted), however _testSetCompleted_ event for rerun still tries to write something there. If temp file isn't yet created (still in memory) then there will be no bug and it gets created only after 1m characters were written to the stream. I wasn't able to understand wether multiple _testSetCompleted_ events is a bug here or a "rerun" trying to write to _DeferredFileOutputStream_ of initial test run.
