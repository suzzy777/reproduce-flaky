[~dpavlov] Could you please take a look?

[~slava.koptilin], Suspicious test:
   Ignite Platform .NET [ tests 1 TIMEOUT ] 
    Test failures count is low < 3, probably new test introduced   exe: CacheQueriesTest.TestScanQuery(True) 



[~slava.koptilin], [~dpavlov], the changes look good to me. Please feel free to merge them once you solve all the concerns about the flaky tests.

I have checked, the test and it doesn't seem that the test failure related to the described changes.

[~slava.koptilin] [~dmagda], thank you for the contribution. Merged to master
