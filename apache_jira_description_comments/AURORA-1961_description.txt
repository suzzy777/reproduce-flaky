The current Aurora build is flaky. This is causing unnecessary headache for our contributors.

*Affected patches right now:*

* https://reviews.apache.org/r/64341/ by [~jingc]
* https://reviews.apache.org/r/64290/ by [~jsirois]

*Observed issues:*

a) Build prints hundreds of lines of spotbugs output rather than capping it at 40 lines as configured in Jenkins.

There is an [upstream issue|https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/issues/506] mean to reduce the output itself. In any case, our build script should properly tail only the last lines of it.

b) Failing webhooks test. [The attempted fix|https://github.com/apache/aurora/commit/ef24c2ce355e857c4fcce531b4f16028a6c6e75d] does not seem to work
