A ForcedDisconnectException in a distributed test indicates either a sick JVM, often doing GC and sometimes on the metaspace, or an environmental problem such as insufficient resources to run the host VM.  As this test hasn't failed in Geode Jenkins or any Pivotal-private concourse runs that I can find I have no way of checking on the environment or the logs of this particular run.

If this test, or any other for that matter, fails with a ForcedDisconnectException the machine hosting the run should be examined and the logs of the failed test should be examined for GC activity.

This test failed again in a slightly different way:

GEODE-2673: overhaul PartitionedRegion dunit tests (#1486)

* Delete PartitionedRegionDUnitTestCase
* Overhaul every dunit test that extended PartitionedRegionDUnitTestCase
* Fix flakiness in several dunit tests
* Document and update test methods that were named after old TRAC bugs
* Extract regression test methods to new dedicated test classes
* Extract unrelated test methods to new dedicated test classes
* Extract inner classes that are used by multiple test classes
* Change PRIdMap prIdToPR in PartitionedRegion to be private and change tests to use an accessor to reference it
* Change localBucket2RegionMap in PartitionedRegionDataStore to be private and change tests to use an accessor to reference it
* Move "Set getSomeKeys(Random rnd)" from PartitionedRegion product code to PartitionedRegionGetSomeKeys in test code
* Make IgnoredException AutoCloseable so you can use it within try-resource blocks
* Add "IgnoredException addIgnoredException(final Class exceptionClass)" to IgnoredException
