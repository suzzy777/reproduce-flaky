Thank you [~e.dimitrova], for further improving on the previous change and even fixing a bug that previously resulted in a flaky unit test.

I've noticed that you added a new NoReplicationTokenAllocatorTest.failed field with assertions, but it does not seem to be set to true anywhere. Could you please check whether it is needed.

After the change from random tokens to splits, TokenAllocatorDiagnostics.randomTokensGenerated does not seem to be used anymore. Could you please consider removing it, if not needed.

Thank you for the review [~kornelpal]!

I think actually I should create new method probably for an event to be published. I will check what is needed a bit later or Thursday (off tomorrow). Good catch!

I think this assertion is actually not needed anymore

Failing dtests not related to this patch but I didn't find tickets so probably good to follow up on them:

JAVA 11:

test_resumable_rebuild - rebuild_test.TestRebuild - not related but I didn't find a ticket so good to follow up on it probably

test_short_read - consistency_test.TestConsistency - not related but I didn't find a ticket so good to follow up on it probably

JAVA 8:

test_multiple_repair - repair_tests.incremental_repair_test.TestIncRepair - not related but I didn't find a ticket so good to follow up on it probably

The rest of the dtests failures are handled under [CASSANDRA-15677|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-15677] 

Screenshot added to prove the fixed unit test is not flaky anymore. 

*The first commit is the actual patch. The second commit applies our custom CircleCI config and shouldn't be committed! Kept for test purposes.*

*The third commit is to add event for new split generations plus removal of unused code.*

 

[~e.dimitrova] I had some cycles so wanted to help with the review here. The tests you point out are pretty stable on ci-cassandra see [here|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/176/testReport/dtest-novnode.repair_tests.incremental_repair_test/TestIncRepair/test_multiple_repair/history/], [here|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/176/testReport/dtest.rebuild_test/TestRebuild/test_resumable_rebuild/history/] and [here|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/176/testReport/dtest-novnode.consistency_test/TestConsistency/test_short_read/history/]. So I would suggest you run those locally just to make sure. Otherwise lgtm +1

Thanks [~Bereng]

All three fail both on trunk and with my patch.

For those that are v11, I think just Jenkins runs the test suite only for Java 8, as far as I remember?

For the one failing in Java 8, I saw it this week also with other CI runs and I am not sure why it does not fail in Jenkins.

I will raise tickets for the failing tests on Monday but I believe this patch should be ready for commit.

[~brandon.williams], can you check and commit this patch, please, if you don't have any concerns, of course? 

 

Did you see  the comments that Andres left on your PR?

[~adelapena]'s comments are addressed in a new separate
 [commit|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/pull/44/commits/a4dac9d33b86325f07ea722d592824d12d2e40ba].

I didn't run a new CI as they are formatting changes. 

Separate tickets for the failing tests, not related to this patch were opened:

*JAVA 11:*

_test_resumable_rebuild - rebuild_test.TestRebuild_ - CASSANDRA-15892

_test_short_read - consistency_test.TestConsistency_ - CASSANDRA-15893

*JAVA 8:*

_test_multiple_repair - repair_tests.incremental_repair_test.TestIncRepair_ - CASSANDRA-15894

 

 

The changes look good to me, +1

Thanks [~adelapena]. Can you or [~brandon.williams] commit it, please?
I am not a committer. Thanks in advance :) 

Committed, thank you!
