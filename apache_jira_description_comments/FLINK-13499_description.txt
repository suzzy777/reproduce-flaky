The MapR artifact repository causes some problems. It does not reliably offer a secure (https://) access.

We should change the MapR FS connector to work based on reflection and avoid a hard dependency on any of the MapR vendor-specific artifacts. That should allow us to get rid of the dependency without regressing on the support for the file system.
