This is an issue with inline automatic rollbacks.

Metadata table assumes that a rollbacks is to be applied if the instant-being-rolled back has a timestamp less than the last deltacommit time on the metadata timeline. We do not explicitly check if the instant-being-rolled-back was actually written to metadata table.

**A rollback adds a record to metadata table which "deletes" files from a failed/earlier commit. If the files being deleted were never actually committed to metadata table earlier, the deletes cannot be consolidated during metadata table reads. This leads to a HoodieMetadataException as we cannot differentiate this from a bug where we might have missed committing a commit to metadata table.
