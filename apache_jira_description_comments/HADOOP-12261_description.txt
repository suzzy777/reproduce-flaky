hadoop-project/pom.xml sets maven-surefire-plugin.argLine to include -Xmx4096m. Allocating  that amount of memory requires a 64-bit JVM, but on platforms with both 32 and 64-bit JVMs surefire runs the 32 bit version by default and tests fail to start as a result. "-d64" should be added to the command-line arguments to ensure a 64-bit JVM is always used.
