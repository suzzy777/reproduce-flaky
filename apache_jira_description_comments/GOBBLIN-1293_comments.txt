should we go for latest Gradle v6.7 ?

Ideally it would be nice to go to 6.7 but I want to go up one major version at a time, just to make sure there isn't any breaking changes.
Also it does introduce some tooling changes, such as no more support for findbugs and introducing spotbugs (which I'm working on right now).
