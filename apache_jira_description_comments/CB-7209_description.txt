cordova-blackberry has some somewhat flaky tests...

* They call createSpy in places where they should use spyOn
* They use a fixed temp directory (which makes parallel tests trip on eachother)
* They make odd assumptions about process.argv (which isn't nice when a random test system might be feeding it...)
* They run "windows" tests on other platforms (which is pretty pointless)
