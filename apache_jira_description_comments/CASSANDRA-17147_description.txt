The purpose of this ticket is creating an initial implementation of the guardrails framework, as well as adding a few simple guardrails using this framework.

To keep things easy, this initial implementation would only support guardrails that are triggered on the coordinator, and they would be dynamically updatable only through JMX.

Once we have this initial framework ready in a feature branch we can have multiple tickets addressing all the things that would have been left out of the scope of this ticket, such as:

* Dynamic updates through virtual tables
* Being able to notify about guardrails triggered on replicas
* Using custom exceptions other than {{InvalidRequestException}}.
* Porting existing limits to use the new guardrails framework
* Adding new guardrails beyond the initial ones

The reason for having this simpler prototype is that it will give us a common ground to parallelize work on the parts mentioned above.
