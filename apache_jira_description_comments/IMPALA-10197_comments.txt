I wanted to note here that I think when exposing LEADER_ONLY as a real option you may need to also adjust the logic that tells impala the replica locations to filter on the replica role being the leader. Kudu offers the API to do that already, so I think the filtering would just need to be added here: https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/ab6b7960db3181096134b8aa46cb90baff6df006/fe/src/main/java/org/apache/impala/planner/KuduScanNode.java#L215-L252

Hi Zoltán,

I am sorry to say this but I have not been able to find time to solve this
issue. Please unassign me from this issue so that another person can work
in it.

I apologize once again for the inconvenience.

Thank you,
Akshatha.

IMPALA-10197: Add KUDU_REPLICA_SELECTION query option

Sometimes it is useful to target queries at the leader only replica
instead of the default closest replica.
This patch added new query option KUDU_REPLICA_SELECTION with which to
choose replicas for Kudu amongst multiple Kudu replicas.
Removed variable FLAGS_pick_only_leaders_for_tests since its usage can
be replaced by the new query option.
Added new planner and end-to-end tests for the new query option.

Testings:
  - Passed exhaustive tests.

IMPALA-10197 (Part 2): Add KUDU_REPLICA_SELECTION query option

The previous patch added a new test case in PlannerTest for Kudu,
which check for specific number of hosts and instances for distributed
plan with query option KUDU_REPLICA_SELECTION set as LEADER_ONLY.
However, the leadership isn't deterministic since each Kudu partition
has its own Raft group and the leaders of these groups are not exactly
balanced across hosts in a cluster. There's no guarantee that we'll get
a certain number of leader hosts for a query which access multiple KUDU
partitions. This makes the unit-test flaky.

This patch removed the distributed plans to avoid nondeterminism.

Testing:
 - Reran the Planner test and verified the issue did not happen.
