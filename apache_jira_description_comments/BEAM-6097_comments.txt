Hi! Could I be re-assigned for this issue? Something must have happened without me knowing it :)Â I've opened the issue to file a PR as talked over on the dev mailing list thread.

Done. And I have added you to the "Contributor" Jira role so you can assign yourself any issue you like.

Lovely! Thanks :)
