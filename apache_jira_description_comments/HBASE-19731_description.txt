These two tests fail frequently locally; rare does this suite pass.

The failures are either of these two tests.  Unfortunately, running the test standalone does not bring  on the issue; need to run the whole suite.

In both cases, we have a Delete followed by a Put and then a checkAnd* -type operation which does a Get expecting to find the just put Put but it fails on occasion.

Looks to be an mvcc issues or Put going in at same timestamp as the Delete. Its hard to debug given any added logging seems to make it all pass again.

Seems this too is new in beta-1. Running tests against alpha-4 seem to pass.

Doing a compare....
