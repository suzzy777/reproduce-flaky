The following line ([#48|https://github.com/apache/incubator-geode/blob/develop/gemfire-core/src/main/java/com/gemstone/gemfire/management/internal/cli/functions/GetRegionsFunction.java#L48]) in the {{GetRegionsFunction}} class could possibly lead to a NPE if the {{regions}} _Set_ is null since the {{regions.isEmpty()}} call proceeds the {{regions == null}} check.

Of course, one should argue whether {{Cache.rootRegions()}} should be returning a null _Set_ at all rather than an empty _Set_ if there are in fact no "root" _Regions_ in the Geode _Cache_.

But then, one could also argue that this {{GetRegionsFunction}} should not be returning a null "array" if there are no "root" _Regions_ in the Geode _Cache_ either.  It too should be returning an "empty" array.
