--Failed when running client tests on top of Hadoop 2. [see log for details|https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/master/1595//artifact/output-integration/hadoop-2.log]. (note that this means we didn't run on Hadoop 3)


All shell unit test failed. Because the code in shell still needÂ HColumnDescriptor(String cf). Please upload a addendum patch to update shell use case too. Thanks.

Sure, since the usages of HCD is quite high in shell, need some work. Let me open Jira to replace the same in shell module and as an addendum patch, bringing back deprecated method for now.
