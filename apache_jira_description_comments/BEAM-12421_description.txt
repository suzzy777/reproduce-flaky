There are more and more flakiness on this IO due to load. I think it is time to migrate from in-jvm ES test framework to test containers.

See discussion: [https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/reb68f37c435995a64ded19100e09dfc31c5cf6227feae16494226100%40%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E]

[~egalpin] I took the liberty to assign to you, feel free to unassign if it is a problem.

[~lboutros] I know you worked on that already, maybe you have a testContainers code for ES to give (I remember you had a starting impl in your github) can you send it to serve as a base for PR ?

To do this migration I think ES2 should be removed. A poll was done among users last year and it concluded to removal of ES 2 (no more supported by elastic since some years)
