The issue seems analogous to CASSANDRA-19000, a different test in the same class. 
However, we never managed to reproduce it in CircleCI for any of the tests in the test class in thousands of runs, so that is new. 
Suggested patch [here|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commit/66b3b8ddd35bb2a3b0ca79498e4559e5e3d80cd6].
Repeated test run [without|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2606/workflows/3c18b390-adca-47ad-8479-34d79cdb03a6] and [with|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2605/workflows/8cecc141-5db4-445a-abdd-42b4adfca11b] the patch (2000 times each) does not reproduce the issue. 


I suggest we add this patch to all branches where the test exists
