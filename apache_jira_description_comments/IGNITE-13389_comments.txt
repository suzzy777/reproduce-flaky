[~ptupitsyn] thanks for review, partially fixed.

[~ptupitsyn] hi ! can u merge it, or i need to find someone else ? thanks !

[~zstan] please see above:

> And please follow the check list in the PR - set the title and the description properly...

And please see my comments on GitHub - I think we should rename the new property to *sendServerExceptionStackTraceToClient*

[~ptupitsyn] your comment was under "code outdated" mark, i just forgot to resolve it, now i press the button.
I don`t have a clue what problem with title here ? It contains short part of description i change both a little bit, is it ok for now ?

thanks !

[~zstan] you have updated the JIRA issue title, and I'm talking about the Pull Request:

1. Title is "IGNITE-13389" - summary is missing
2. Description contains the default checklist template - it should be replaced with a real description.
