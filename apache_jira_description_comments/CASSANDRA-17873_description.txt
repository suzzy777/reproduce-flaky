In CASSANDRA-15108 ASM was updated and UDFByteCodeVerifier was updated to provide Opcodes.ASM7 but only in 1 of 3 places. 

We need to update that for 4.0, 4.1 and trunk where we support JDK11.

Also, I think it will be good to add one place where we update that when we add new JDK support as now I see we will have to update it at 4 places at least already (also for the simulator where currently it is Opcodes.ASM7 there, correctly added). Also, we can add a note in build.xml for people updating ASM. I think many people practice updating Opcodes.ASM* with the update of ASM version but in our case with update of JDK, from what I see. We will need to switch to ASM9 when we add the JDK 17 support. One stop place for that and adding a note for maintainers sounds like the right way to move forward at least on trunk. 

But for 4.0 and 4.1 we need at least to switch to ASM7 everywhere as far as I can tell.
