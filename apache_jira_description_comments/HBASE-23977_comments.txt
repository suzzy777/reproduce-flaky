Happened again:

[ERROR] Failures:
[ERROR]   TestSlowLogRecorder.testOnlineSlowLogWithHighRecords:219->confirmPayloadParams:97 expected:<client_1[4]4> but was:<client_1[5]4>

I'm going to disable this for now.

I disabled this test with a subissue.

Let me take this up. Thanks [~stack]

Thank you [~vjasani]. If you want me to try anything, just put up a patch (add as much debug as you want) and I'll run it here locally on my test machine set.

[~stack] Please review [https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/1286]

I ran flaky tests 30 and 50 times in loop with this patch and all are passed. The issue seemed mostly due to consumer of ringbuffer being slow (expected), by the time some events are processed, we expect specific ordered events (which would be overridden sometimes)

I have updated the patch based on suggestions from you [~ndimiduk] [~stack]

And I ran each test in this class 50 times in loop in 2 different env with positive results. [~stack] if you are +1 with updated patch and could run it once in your linux vm (the same env, same config), that would be really helpful.

Instead of direct sleep, I am using waitFor() family function now.

[~stack] [~ndimiduk] sorry for one more quick follow up while both of you are quite busy.

The changes done in the patch are to ensure that we wait for ordered events processing done by consumer of ring buffer rather than just sleeping for some fixed amount of time.

For instance, if we send \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7} to RingBuffer of size 8, then all of them are consumed in same order. Now if we send \{8,9,10,11}, we expect final output from RingBuffer consumer to be \{9,10,11,4,5,6,7,8}  (1,2,3 are overridden). However, the reason why we have flakes is because by the time we expect above output, consumer might not have consumed say 10 and 11 and hence actual output would be \{9,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. And hence the failures, so now with waitFor(), we wait until we get ordered output \{9,10,11,4,5,6,7,8}, which is why we will wait for all of 8,9,10,11 to be consumed and put in the queue in correct order i.e. no flakes.

I see Nick did some review.

I took a look at upstream master flakies and I don't see this in the list which is good. Can let it stew a little longer and if good, can bring back to branch-2 and branch-2.3? (Can do nick's feedback in a master addendum?). Thanks [~vjasani]

Checking-in Nick's feedback as Addendum. With addendum, tested each test 105 times in loop locally and things look good. Thanks [~ndimiduk] [~stack]

Sorry for bit early commit, wanted to get rid of these flakes. Thanks to both of you!

thanks [~vjasani]!
