I was able to run both of these a few thousand times without failure on java 8. :(

According to https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/branches/job/Cassandra-trunk/45/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.service/MoveTest/history/ this hasn't been failing in a while. Can we close this ticket?

[~eduard.tudenhoefner] I can consistently reproduce this by using breakpoints, so the issue is still there. I'm about to submit a patch with a fix, but I think I found another potential race condition in this test yesterday, which I'm investigating now.

The issue here is that once the this line is executed in MoveTest's @Before method, {{StorageService.instance.getTokenMetadata().clearUnsafe()}}, the {{GossipStage}} thread kicks in and starts evicting the stale endpoints from membership, which may happen in parallel while another test method is already running.

To reproduce this in an IDE, you can set breakpoints at:

[https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/1ce3c1c039561c15892115af37e0c7abf260bc6b/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/Util.java#L222]

and

[https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/1ce3c1c039561c15892115af37e0c7abf260bc6b/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/gms/Gossiper.java#L524]

If the main thread starts executing the second iteration of the loop in {{createInitialRing}} while the GossipStage thread is removing the endpoints in {{evictFromMembership}}, it will throw a NPE down the road.

The fix I submitted basically makes the main thread wait for all endpoints to be evicted in between tests, such that the next test starts in a clean state.
