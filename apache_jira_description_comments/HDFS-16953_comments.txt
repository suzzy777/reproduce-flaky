   RBF Mount table state store APIs addMountTableEntry, updateMountTableEntry and removeMountTableEntry performs cache refresh for all routers regardless of the actual record update result. If the record fails to get updated on zookeeper/file based store impl, reloading the cache for all routers would be unnecessary.
   
   For instance, simultaneously adding new mount point could lead to failure for the second call if first call has not added new entry by the time second call retrieves mount table entry from getMountTableEntries before attempting to call addMountTableEntry.
   ```
   DEBUG [{cluster}/{ip}:8111] ipc.Client - IPC Client (1826699684) connection to nn-0-{ns}.{cluster}/{ip}:8111 from {user}IPC Client (1826699684) connection to nn-0-{ns}.{cluster}/{ip}:8111 from {user} sending #1 org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocolPB.RouterAdminProtocol.addMountTableEntry

   DEBUG [{cluster}/{ip}:8111 from {user}] ipc.Client - IPC Client (1826699684) connection to nn-0-{ns}.{cluster}/{ip}:8111 from {user}: stopped, remaining connections 0
   TRACE [main] ipc.ProtobufRpcEngine2 - 1: Response <- nn-0-{ns}.{cluster}/{ip}:8111: addMountTableEntry {status: false}
   
   Cannot add mount point /data503 
   ```
   
   The failure to write new record:
   ```
   INFO  [IPC Server handler 0 on default port 8111] impl.StateStoreZooKeeperImpl - Cannot write record "/hdfs-federation/MountTable/0SLASH0data503", it already exists 
   ```
   Since the successful call has already refreshed cache for all routers, second call that failed should not have refreshed cache for all routers again as everyone already has updated records in cache.

   > If I got it all right
   
   Absolutely sir, all points are correct. Sorry for adding more details above. I wish I had a way to write a test to validate this, I tried but could not find better way to write a test. I found that we have some tests like TestRouterAdminCLI#testAddMountTable for which one of the addMountEntry calls fails (log `Cannot add mount point /test-addmounttable`) but validating that we prevent reloading cache for unsuccessful attempt seems quite trickier, otherwise some small test might have made this look bit clear.

   While exactly verifying this patch's behavior might not be feasible (non-flaky test), let me at least validate that source and destination both are present with one successful and one failed attempt of adding the mount table entry.
