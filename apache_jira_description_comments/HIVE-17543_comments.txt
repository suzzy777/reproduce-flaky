[~hsubramaniyan], [~pvary], [~lirui] could you review?

Main things of note:

* I renamed the current {{TestPerfCliDriver}} to {{TestTezPerfCliDriver}} and created a new {{TestSparkPerfCliDriver}}
* I set {{hive.auto.convert.join}} to {{true}} for the {{TestSparkCliDriver}} since thats closer to what is run in production
* I had to make some changes to {{SparkCrossProductCheck}} and {{SparkWork}} to avoid some flakiness in the tests
* There are two TPC-DS queries that I couldn't get to work with HoS - query14 and query64 - I'll file follow up tasks for fixing them
* I haven't gone through the explain plans of every single TPC-DS query for HoS, mainly because that will take a really long time, but I plan to do it as a follow up task; committing this now will give us better regression testing

And {{TestTezPerfCliDriver.testCliDriver[query14]}} was already failing.

[~stakiar]: Is it possible to have a review board without the q.out-s? I do not feel qualified to review the q.outs :)

Thanks for taking a look [~pvary]. Addressed your comments. Updated the RB with the q.out-s excluded.

+1 pending tests.
We should enable these tests on the pre-commit job

Thanks for taking a look [~pvary]. Yes, they are running in pre-commit now - https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/6978/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli/TestSparkPerfCliDriver/

Thanks for the review Peter, pushed to master.

[~stakiar], [~pvary] the failure of {{TestDanglingQOuts}} is related...there is an unused q.out in the patch: /home/hiveptest/35.192.226.129-hiveptest-1/apache-github-source-source/ql/src/test/results/clientpositive/perf/spark/query14.q.out
In HIVE-17550 I've removed a lot of unused q.out-s which were just floating there...and I've added the test to avoid it in the future ... could you remove it? 


Argh... Sorry [~kgyrtkirk], that I have missed it :(
Creating a followup jira

I think an addendum is ok in this case

Never done that before :)

me niether ..but I've seen some examples in the git history :) 

Do I have to do anything else, than a commit with the correct message?

I think that should do it :)

Done. Thanks again for finding this!

This jira is resolved and released with Hive 3.0 If you find an issue with it, please create a new jira.
