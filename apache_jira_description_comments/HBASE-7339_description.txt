Steps:
- Have a single region table t with 15 hfiles in it.
- Snapshot it. (was done using online snapshot from HBASE-7321)
- Clone a snapshot to table t'. 
- t' has its region do a post-open task that attempts to compact region.  policy does not compact all files. (default seems to be 10)
- after compaction we have hfile links and real hfiles mixed in the region
- t' starts splitting
- creating split references, opening daughers fails 
- hfile links are "split", creating hfile link daughter refs.  {{<<hfile>\-<region>\-<table>>.<parentregion>}}
- these "split" hfile links are interpreted as hfile links with table {{<table>.<parentregion>}} -> {{<<hfile>\-<region>>\-<<table>.<parentregion>>}}  (groupings interpreted incorrectly)
- Since this is after the splitting PONR, this aborts the server.  It then spreads to the next server.
