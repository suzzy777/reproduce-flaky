Additional test (that require multiple Kafka consumers):

 {color:#505f79}*WHEN*{color} a message is published to the topic
 {color:#505f79}*THEN*{color} both of the ConsumeKafka processors should produce identical flowfiles

*Background:*

See parent task.

*Proposal:*

This should be the first part of the implementation, the second being adding and testing multiple security protocols.
