This dcheck occasionally fires:
{code}
impalad.FATAL:F1201 22:35:58.617157 30293 plan-fragment-executor.cc:518] Check failed: other_time <= total_time (25999394 vs. 25999393)
{code}

I suspect the problem is with using floating point operations in places like this:
{code}
   timespec ts;
    clock_gettime(OsInfo::fast_clock(), &ts);
    return ts.tv_sec * 1e9 + ts.tv_nsec;
{code}

and because floating point doesn't distribute, and we can end up with {noformat} c * (a + b) < c * a + c * b {noformat} which is effectively what the dcheck does.
