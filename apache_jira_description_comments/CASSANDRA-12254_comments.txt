I suspect most of these are related to the {{initial_token}} not being specified explicitly (similar to CASSANDRA-12235), so depending on token position of the new node there could be different results.

It seems most of these dtests were fixed by CASSANDRA-11414, which just had it's PR merged last week (all failures are from before that).
