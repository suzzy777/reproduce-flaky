The UGI has a background thread to renew the tgt. On exception, it [terminates itself|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/bee9f57f5ca9f037ade932c6fd01b0dad47a1296/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/security/UserGroupInformation.java#L1013-L1014]

If something temporarily goes wrong that results in an IOE, even if it recovered no renewal will be done and client will eventually fail to authenticate. We should retry with our best effort, until tgt expires, in the hope that the error recovers before that.
