After IGNITE-16523 was implemented test WriteAheadLogManagerSelfTest.testNoRaceAutoArchiveAndDeactivation has become flaky on TC.

TC history for the test is available [here|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/test/6527190802482126571?currentProjectId=IgniteTests24Java8&branch=%3Cdefault%3E].

Test fails on an assertion in test logic:

{code:java}
            GridTimeoutObject timeoutObj = timeoutRollover(n);
            assertNotNull(timeoutObj);
{code}

It looks like latest improvements in WAL related to CDC feature could bring new race here.
