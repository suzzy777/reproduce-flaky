We artificially reduce the REST request timeout from 90 seconds to 10 seconds while running the BlockingConnectorTest suite, which allows some test cases that issue REST requests that are expected to time out to proceed faster without eating up 90 seconds spinning their wheels.

However, this reduction is applied by mutating static state in the JVM, and since Connect tests from different suites can be run concurrently, it has the potential to impact other tests and make them flaky.
