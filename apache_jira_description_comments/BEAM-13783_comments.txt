This flakiness started ~the same time as BEAM-13769. Could it also be related to https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/2269b04313f319f8b5ca7fba4fa0a2db8633dfb7 ?

The flakiness resolved yesterday as well, presumably due to https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16651. CC [~Anand Inguva]

This issue was marked "stale-assigned" and has not received a public comment in 7 days. It is now automatically unassigned. If you are still working on it, you can assign it to yourself again. Please also give an update about the status of the work.

I've checked daily runs for the last 20 days and this has not failed, I think we can mark this as resolved.

Thanks [~Ryan.Thompson] - FYI for test/infra tickets like this we usually mark them with fix version N/A, since they're not relevant for release notes.
