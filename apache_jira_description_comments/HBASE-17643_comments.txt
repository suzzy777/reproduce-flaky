The most recent three builds are green. Prior to that a few back were build failures due to environmental issues, like:

{code}
    TEST-org.apache.hadoop.hbase.TestAcidGuarantees.xml.[failed-to-read]
{code}

Jenkins failed the build because it couldn't parse the junit xml output for TestAcidGuarantees, etc. 

The scope of this issue is too wide. I plan to close as invalid. Let's open issues for specific failing tests. 

I agree [~apurtell], opened it more to raise awareness rather than report actual bugs; and while env bugs are annoying too broad jiras won't help here. thanks for looking at it!
