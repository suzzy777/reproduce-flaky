Hmm, this is caused by SOLR-12791 which was committed today. The restarting of Jetty's in the MiniSolrCloudCluster probably causes this, but I only saw this error when beasting with >3 parallell runs. Will try to reproduce.

I see lots of other fails in beasting today, including due to a core reload cleanup bug, but largely around a bad assumption about metric read/write timing. I'm going to commit a hack fix for that, but someone should really make the metric count checking method wait for a timeout to see expected counts or something.

There are three test classes that currently use the metric counting assertion from {{SolrCloudAuthTestCase}}, and I think you may be right that this is a timing issue which is more likely to appear on some fast servers than on a laptop etc.

I'll try adding some timeout to the assert in {{SolrCloudAuthTestCase.assertExpectedMetrics()}}

Retrying on fail does not help, even several seconds. Simply relaxing the expected metric count from 4 to 3 (and 7 to 6) seems to be a better medicine, at least short term. Will commit a fix to SOLR-12791 to make Jenkins happy and then we can work on further improvements.

SOLR-12791, SOLR-13067: Fix test failure for BasicAuthIntegrationTest
Make PkiAuthenticationIntegrationTest beast-able

SOLR-13067: Harden BasicAuthIntegrationTest.


Yeah, I went for relaxing for now as well. I don't like it, but better to have a passing test than a flaky one or losing coverage. These changes survived my difficult beasting settings (which slow envs tend to hit surprisingly often).

[~markrmiller@gmail.com]Is this still an issue?

Closing as implemented since there are lots of commits on this. Let's open new issue if there are new failures.

tthank you [~janhoy]
