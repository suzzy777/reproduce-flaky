TestDelegationTokenWithEncryption and TestGenerateDelegationToken _always_ fail.

 

Incidentally, they don't fail in branch-2.3 and branch-2.2.

 

I suspect there's a regression with delegation token code, because if I comment out the following code in the test, they pass:

 
{code:java}
try (Connection conn = ConnectionFactory.createConnection(TEST_UTIL.getConfiguration())) {
  Token<? extends TokenIdentifier> token = TokenUtil.obtainToken(conn);
  UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser().addToken(token);
}
{code}
Effectively, use Kerberos to login instead of delegation token.

The tests fail all the time (100%) in the last 29 runs:

Initially I thought this was caused by pluggable authentication (HBASE-23347), but the tests don't fail in branch-2.3 so looks unlikely.
