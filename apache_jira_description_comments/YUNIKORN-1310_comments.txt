This appears to be a timeout issue (10 seconds).

There are a couple of other issues however. For one, the namespace is hardcoded, which means it may conflict if run on an existing cluster (see other tests for how this is handled). For another, the sleep pod takes a very long time to tear down. Use InitSleepPod() as other tests do so that the teardown happens more quickly.

[~pbacsko] please check as I think this has been fixed already as part of the dynamic namespace change you made for the tests

I do believe this has been resolved as part of YUNIKORN-1569 by creating new namespaces for each test, but let me double check.

Closing, no longer an issue.
