{{hive.spark.client.connect.timeout}} is set to 30 seconds for {{TestMiniSparkOnYarnCliDriver}} but it left at the default value for all other tests. We should use the same value (30 seconds) for all other tests.

We have seen flaky tests due to failure to establish the remote within the allotted timeout. This could be due to the fact that we run our tests in the cloud so maybe occasional network delays are more common.
