When Cassandra batch opens all sstables at startup, it should check that all components listed in the TOC.txt are available. Compression is optional, so there may not be a Compression.db component for all sstables, but if there should be and it's missing we continue to load the sstable. The sstable is unreadable without the compression metadata though, but we won't know this until it's touched by a query or compaction.

To reliably use TOC.txt for verification, it needs CASSANDRA-10709
