    IGNITE-8161 test for suspend\resume operations fixed

----


[~dpavlov] the root cause of failed is simple : 
transaction timeout in test happened to be too small, which caused unexpected timeout exception in *cache.put()* operation.
Failed test : _IgniteOptimisticTxSuspendResumeTest.testTxTimeoutOnResumed_

I increased it and test passed 500 times : [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1294880&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Cache6&tab=testsInfo]
 Also test suites, containing the test passed : [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1297825&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Cache6]

Could you review this tiny change?

[~Alexey Kuznetsov] , LGTM.

Merged to master, Ignite 2.6.

[~Alexey Kuznetsov] thank you for contribution
