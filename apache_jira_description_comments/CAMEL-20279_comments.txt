It's just a github action glitch.

It is a glitch which occurs very often. it is making it more difficult to check dependencies upgrades. Maybe it is a bug in GitHub, in this case we can try to report the issue, or vote for it or even try to fix it as it is impacting us.

I don't really think something will change, because it happens in different components, sometimes is s3, sometimes IAM, SQS or SNS. So I don't think we could isolate the reason.

That's interesting feddback. Woulde be nice to report these failures too to see if it is the exact same stacktrace, if it is using the exact same image.
it can give hints to investigate and it will also allows for newcomers to know that it is a known issue when it is failing on these other components too.

Let's leave it open
