I have this working locally by overloading Feature.NATIVE, if you select native you also get thrift.  The main thing I want to make sure we are in-sync on is if this is ok or if we should add a new Feature.THRIFT (which no-op in 4.0)?

This does pose a problem though, since thrift was removed all upgrade tests which use thrift can't show the upgrade to 4.0 is success... this may be a great time to also consider tests outside of the cassandra repo.

I don't have a strong preference whether we have a separate {{THRIFT}} feature, or will use the existing {{NATIVE}}. I think it's fine to use the existing one, even. Maybe we need to renamie it from NATIVE to CLIENT or something like that not to suggest we're enabling _only_ native transport. That said, CQLTester and ThriftCQLTester are separate in code.

As regards out-of-tree upgrade tests, when we were talking about dtest-api and writing tests outside main repository, we did want to have some API that would let us annotate tests with Cassandra versions they'll be running against, and when they'll be skipped, just like in python dtests. Different versions sometimes have different behaviour, so this is definitely required. We don't need to have it right now though, just "eventually".

I will file a ticket for capturing the version.  should be trivial to add since we currently have it, but we ignore everything after major.minor.

patches for 2.2, 3.0, and 3.11 are submitted; I went with NATIVE starting native and thrift.

Tested this patch via a upgrade dtest in CASSANDRA-15970, but will rerun the upgrade tests in circle ci

+1 from me too (though can't commit).

Looks like I broke python dtests for 3.0.  I only ran unit/jvm-dtests and neglected to run python dtests; will look to fix this.

Looks like I didn't break it!!!!  was broken before the commit: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra/340/workflows/8f5af50c-930b-49ab-8cbf-e84318015eff/jobs/1694


Looks like you guys haven't merged it into trunk (with -s ours). Taking care of it, just remember to always propagate the change all the way to trunk, even as an empty merge commit.

Thanks, didn't know that; will upgrade the doc https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/development/how_to_commit.html
