maybe I can try to repair this problem

[~xujianhai] that would be great. You can find instructions on how to file a PR on "how to contribute": https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Contributing+Code+Changes

If you are using IDE, you can try first reproduce the issue locally with repeated runs and and then follow the logs to see if it is indeed a flaky test and how to fix it.

h3. Error Message

org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: Expected exception java.io.IOException to be thrown, but no exception was thrown

[https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk8-scala2.11/27037/console]

Since this is not a blocker issue, as part of the 2.6.0 release process I'm changing the fix version to `2.6.1` and `2.7.0`. If this is incorrect, please respond and discuss on the "[DISCUSS] Apache Kafka 2.6.0 release" discussion mailing list thread.

Since this is not a blocker, there is no active PR I'm clearing the "fix version" field as part of the 2.7.0 release process.
