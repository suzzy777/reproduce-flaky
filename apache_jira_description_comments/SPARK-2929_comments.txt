I'm bumping the severity of this as it has been failing every Spark SQL PR for a while, which is creating a lot of noise when reviewing patches.

Opened SPARK-3126 & SPARK-3127 to track failure of these test suites more precisely. [PR #2036|https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/2036] was submitted to fix both of these two issues.

Set SPARK-3126 as blocker and restored this one to major.
