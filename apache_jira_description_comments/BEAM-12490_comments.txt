https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14770 seems coincident and relevant

Hi [~Mike Hernandez] assigning to you for now per [your comment|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14770#issuecomment-860853737]. Feel free to pass back if you think there's some other root cause.

We may want to revert #14770 if we can confirm it's the cause of the flakiness. I'm seeing this failure a lot.

[~Mike Hernandez] any updates here? Do you need help?

[~bhulette] I tried to run the test in my local but I didn't get any error. I've been watching the builds and it seems that the last 9 haven't failed, so I'm not sure if it was a temporary issue or if it needs further examination. Is there any other way to run this test and produce this error?

I found a way to reproduce it reliably - if you run the new gcsio_test, followed by sdk_worker_test:

{code}
python -m pytest sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/gcsio_test.py sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/worker/sdk_worker_test.py
{code}

I guess gcio_test is setting some global state that causes sdk_worker test to fail. Note it doesn't happen if you run sdk_worker_test first, that must be why this is flaky

Left some [comments|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14770#pullrequestreview-686835923] on the PR. 

If it's not clear how to fix this in a day or so I think we should just roll back that PR for now. You're right it hasn't happened recently on the PreCommit_Cron, but I'm still seeing it a lot on precommits that are blocking PRs: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Commit/19087/testReport/apache_beam.runners.worker.sdk_worker_test/SdkWorkerTest/history/ 

I added some changes that solved the comments you left on the PR. Hopefully, this should work, I'll open a PR right away

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15033 should address this. Let's re-open if we see it again though
