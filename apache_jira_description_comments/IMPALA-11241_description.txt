The test failed with "OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded" during this run:
https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-dockerised-tests/5555/

In another run different tests failed, but test_statement_expression_limit was running in parallel:
https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-dockerised-tests/5556/

Checked locally and running test_statement_expression_limit  bumped jvm.heap.current-usage-bytes to ~2GB from ~100 MB, while the other tests only needed a few hundred MBs.
