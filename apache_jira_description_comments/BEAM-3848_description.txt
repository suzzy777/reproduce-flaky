A busy SOLR server is prone to return RemoteSOLRException on writing which currently fails a complete task (e.g. a partition of a spark RDD being written to SOLR).

A good addition would be the ability to provide a retrying mechanism for the batch in flight, rather than failing fast, which will most likely trigger a much larger retry of more writes.
