{{KafkaProducer011}} appears to be leaking {{kafka-producer-network-thread}} threads.  As far as I can tell it happens when it is not in EXACTLY_ONCE mode, it seems that it creates a {{FlinkKafkaProducer}} but never closes it, even when the {{FlinkKafkaProducer011}} itself is closed.

I observed this when running a local cluster and submitting and then cancelling a job, a lot of kafka threads were left alive afterwards.
