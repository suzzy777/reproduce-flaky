    Fix for issue

----


*The test can halt JVM.*
I have rewritten test to avoid use default failure handler.

*The test was flaky.*
I set segmentation policy to NOOP (was STOP) in config. Default handler stops node on segmentation happens in the test. The local listener couldn't get the event if segmentation failure handles first.

*Other fixes.*
I have decreased timeouts and removed unnecessary sleeps for more fast test completion. It still reproduces the problem that fixed in IGNITE-7944 if revert prod changes.
Code style issues.

[TC tests|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Spi&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F4790%2Fhead&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv] are OK. I have run 160 times and test separate suite. 
[~agoncharuk] Could you review, please?

[~NSAmelchev] looks good, will merge shortly.

Merged to master.
