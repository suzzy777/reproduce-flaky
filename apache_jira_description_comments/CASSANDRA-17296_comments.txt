Still relevant as it recently failed [here|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1695/testReport/dtest-upgrade.upgrade_tests.upgrade_through_versions_test/TestProtoV4Upgrade_AllVersions_EndsAt_Trunk_HEAD/test_rolling_upgrade_with_internode_ssl/]

This was marked as a 5.x problem but it affects all the versions. The root issue was found digging the logs:

{noformat}
Process data_checker:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/cassandra/cassandra/cassandra-dtest/upgrade_tests/upgrade_through_versions_test.py", line 133, in data_checker
    actual_val = session.execute(prepared, (key,))[0][0]
  File "/home/cassandra/cassandra/venv/src/cassandra-driver/cassandra/cluster.py", line 2618, in execute
    return self.execute_async(query, parameters, trace, custom_payload, timeout, execution_profile, paging_state, host, execute_as).result()
  File "/home/cassandra/cassandra/venv/src/cassandra-driver/cassandra/cluster.py", line 4894, in result
    raise self._final_exception
cassandra.OperationTimedOut: errors={'Connection defunct by heartbeat': 'Client request timeout. See Session.execute[_async](timeout)'}, last_host=127.0.0.2:9042
{noformat}

Basically a timeout on background processes would blow up the test. Adding 3 retries + graceful stop seems a reasonable solution and 100 repeats (expensive heavy long test) are green.

+1

Thanks for the review!
