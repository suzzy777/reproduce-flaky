[~twmarshall] any idea if this is a code or test bug? Would be good to cut down the number of flaky tests. If you don't have time to look we can find someone else.

Not sure, if anything it seems like a bug in Kudu, but I haven't been able to repro yet.

I haven't been able to repro this, and afaik it hasn't occurred in 2 months, so closing.
