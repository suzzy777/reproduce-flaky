When I run the SqlParserTest,the testNoUnintendedNewReservedKeywords method failed,the exception like this:
{code:java}
java.lang.AssertionError: The parser has at least one new reserved keyword. Are you sure it should be reserved? Difference: {code}
The picture like this:

I could fix this problem.More importantly, why is this method failing, but the Calcite pipeline is passing? I think we should look at something we missed
