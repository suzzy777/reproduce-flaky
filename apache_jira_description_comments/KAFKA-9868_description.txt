h3. Error Message

java.lang.AssertionError: Condition not met within timeout 15000. Expected ERROR state but driver is on RUNNING

From what we observed, in unit test with transaction turned on, it takes a long time to bootstrap the test as well as sometimes getting too many open files for system test. To reduce the start time and make tests less flaky, we should set the number of txn log partitions to a much smaller number than 50.
