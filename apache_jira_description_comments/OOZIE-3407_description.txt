[TestPurgeXCommand|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/apache/oozie/command/TestPurgeXCommand.java]Â is the longest java source file of Oozie, more than 4000 rows. 

As part of the Purge Service rewrite we need to use this file to make sure we don't introduce new bugs and probably we also need to add a few more test cases. Before that it would be useful to cleanup this file and extract redundant code to new methods to make the code shorter and more manageable.

The patch uploaded to OOZIE-3400 introduced three new test cases to this file and shows a simple way to make it shorter.
