apovzner commented on pull request #6482: KAFKA-7989: RequestQuotaTest should wait for quota config change before running tests
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6482
 
 
   This PR fixes KAFKA-7989 and KAFKA-8123: testResponseThrottleTimeWhenBothProduceAndRequestQuotasViolated and testResponseThrottleTimeWhenBothFetchAndRequestQuotasViolated.
   
   The failure was due to throttle-time metric for produce/consume was not updated. 
   
   The root cause of the failure is that test's `setUp()` sets quota configs for various producers/consumers, which is done through admin client, but it waited for only default and unthrottled client quotas to be updated; it did not wait for quota of smallQuotaProducerClientId and smallQuotaConsumerClientId to be updated. The failed tests are those that verify throttle metrics of smallQuotaProducerClientId and smallQuotaConsumerClientId clients. One important details is that default request quota and request quota of smallQuotaConsumer/ProducerClientId is the same == 0.01. The test failure happens if the test producing or consuming by the client with small quots runs before produce/consume quota gets updated (the default request quota is already small). In this case, the request gets throttled due to violating request quota, but not produce/consume quota, while the test expects that both types of quotas are violated. The fix is for the test to wait for all quotas to be updated in `setUp` before running tests.
   
   I was not able to reproduce the test failure locally. However, I was able to "reproduce" this by adding a while loop in the beginning of ClientQuotaManager#updateQuota().
