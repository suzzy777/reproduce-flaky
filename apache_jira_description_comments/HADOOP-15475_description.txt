There are hundreds of unit tests that fail on Windows. This JIRA tracks the effort to fix them.

The main reasons for unit test failures on Windows are:
* Windows/Linux path formats (e.g., HDFS-10256).
* Line separator.
* Locked files: Windows locks files when opening them.
** The typical trigger is not cleaning MiniDFSCluster leaves files locked when a test times out; they need to be cleaned using After.
* Memory lock size.
* Slow DNS resolution (e.g., HDFS-13569).
* Locked ports (e.g., HDFS-11700)
