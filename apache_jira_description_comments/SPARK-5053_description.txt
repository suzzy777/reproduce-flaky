We need to create Jenkins jobs to test maintenance branches using SBT.  The current Maven jobs for backport branches do not run the same checks that the pull request builder / SBT builds do (e.g. MiMa checks, PySpark, RAT, etc.) which means that cherry-picking backports can silently break things and we'll only discover it once PRs that are explicitly opened against those branches fail tests; this long delay between introducing test failures and detecting them is a huge productivity issue.
