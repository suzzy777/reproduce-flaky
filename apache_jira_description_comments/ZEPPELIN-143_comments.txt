    ZEPPELIN-143: Git as a versioned notebook storage

    This is very basic implementation of the [ZEPPELIN-143](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-143) at the backend.
    
    It makes a local git repository our of your `/notebook` dir and commits a new revision for each save/update.
    
    It does not: 
     - add any remotes to the git repo. It is totally possible to do that manually though. It would be interesting to add this later, to be able to push the notebook to hostings like GH
     - have any GUI modifications. It is left as further work, to add the ability for a user to switch "versions" of the notebook,  navigating between previous runs.

    Is there a document (or could one be added) that describes setting up the Git repo integration (git ssh or https path, connecting Zeppelin to a specific git repo, passwords, ssh keys, etc.)?

    @jeffsteinmetz I think this is committing to local only, no remote repo support yet

    @jeffsteinmetz @felixcheung well noted, this PR introduces automation to keep notebook dir inside the git repository in your local filesystem.
    
    Right now, this repository does not have any 'remotes' setup, and Zeppelin does not push it anywhere, so there are no Zeppelin configuration needed (except documented property change).
    
    It is possible and quite simple to sync this local repo manually by `cd notebooks; git add remote ...; git push`, as well as I can add this ability to Zeppelin itself, if people find it useful (in the separate PR).

    @khalidhuseynov thanks for looking into CI problem, that's a bummer!
    > This CI problem should be solved by #468, may need to rebase for that
    
    It looks like it was merged 6 days ago, so current branch should be on top of it already, but just in case - I have synced with the latest master and it seems to pass! If that repeats - will file the jira issue with label 'flaky-test'.

    In 5d7ffea  `.close()` lifecycle method was introduced for the `NotebookRero` to cleanup the resources that storage implementation might have occupied.
    As this is an API change \cc @khalidhuseynov and @Leemoonsoo who worked on this before, as I recall, to take a quick look.

    @herval were you able to finish it ?


Github user herval commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/497
  
    Haven't had the time to look into that further. TBH, I don't think storing notebooks as text files is a good strategy - not in the environment we use Zeppelin, anyway. We're likely moving towards some sort of centralized storage (maybe a KV storage), in order to be able to scale horizontally
