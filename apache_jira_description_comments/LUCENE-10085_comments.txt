I'd like to work on this! I'll dedicate the Nov 15th - 19th week to work on this full time. (I don't have any experience in Java or Lucene, so this could easily take the whole week.)

LUCENE-10085: Fix flaky testQueryMatchesCount (#538)

Five times every 10 000 tests, we did not index any documents with i
between 0 and 10 (inclusive), which caused the deleted tests to fail.

With this commit, we make sure that we always index at least one
document between 0 and 10.

Closing after the 9.1.0 release.

I noticed a (possibly rare) failure. I didn't have the chance to look into it, but it seems like just a test bug. Reproduce line:
{code:java}
./gradlew test --tests TestDocValuesFieldExistsQuery.testQueryMatchesCount -Dtests.seed=2AE288D9EAFE5D6C
{code}
Failure excerpt:
{code:java}
