IMPALA-7003: Deflake erasure coding data loading

Erasure coding data loading is flaky in two ways:
1. HBase sometimes doesn't work because of HBase-19369
2. Nested data loading sometimes fails because the HDFS namenode cannot
find enough good datanodes.

For problem 1, this patch enables erasure coding only on /test-warehouse
directory. For problem 2, this patch sets
dfs.namenode.redundancy.considerLoad to false, preventing namenode from
excluding heavily-loaded datanodes.

IMPALA-6394: Disable dfs.namenode.replication.considerLoad

By default namenode excludes heavily-loaded datanodes from being
considered for block placement. Impala tests rely on every block
to be fully-replicated so this option should be set to false.
This is originally from IMPALA-7004 which was for 3.x branch only. The
option has been renamed to "dfs.namenode.redundancy.considerLoad" in
Hadooop 3.0.
