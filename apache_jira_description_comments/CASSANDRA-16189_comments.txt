test: test_hintedhandoff_metrics is added

Sorry, for the noise around the reviewer and status. I add to do some testing for INFRA-21091 and used that ticket for it.

that's fine. do let me know if there's anything to do on my side.

I should have time next week for the review. Thanks.

From a first round of review I have found that:
 * The methods {{_start_two_node_cluster}}, {{_launch_nodetool_cmd}} and {{_do_hinted_handoff}} seem just copied from {{hintedhandoff_test.py}}. The method {{_drop_node2_and_do_hh}} seems a subset of {{_do_hinted_handoff}}. I think we should try to reuse these methods instead of copying them.
 * The test {{test_hintedhandoff_enabled}} is repeated in {{hintedhandoff_test.py}} and {{hintedhandoff_metrics_test.py}}.
 * If I'm understanding it, the new test {{test_hintedhandoff_metrics}} collects the hh metrics and does some verifications about general invariants of the metrics, like that the rate unit is always events per second, or that {{HintsTimedOut}} is lesser or equals that {{HintsFailed}}, or that the total number of hints is the addition on {{HintsSucceeded}} and {{HintsFailed}}. However, the collected metrics don't contain any failure, so I think we aren't really verifying that hint failures, timeouts, etc. are tracked unless we produce one of these failures.

[~adelapena] I believe that [~mohamed_zafraan] is not active on the project anymore.
Based on your comments, it seems that a significant amount of work is still needed. 
I will mark the ticket for {{4.0.X}} as we decided to defer the additional metric tests for later if they were not close from completion.  

[~blerer]Â I had already written an alternative patch using [a little Java dtest|https://github.com/adelapena/cassandra/blob/0328837c7098c384def30c6878e741e5f891d7be/test/distributed/org/apache/cassandra/distributed/test/metrics/HintsServiceMetricsTest.java]. It uses a Byte Buddy injection to actuate the {{HintsFailed}} metric, and a message filter to actuate the {{HintsTimedOut}} metric.

Thanks for the update [~adelapena].

[~adelapena] the patch looks good. My only concern is the fact that stopping and starting the nodes with in jvm dtest framework while performing writes as sometime caused some flakiness. It might be good to test those new tests for flakiness.   

[~blerer] thaks for the review.

I remember one of those flakies restarting nodes, CASSANDRA-16754, which was failing due to not waiting for the future returned by {{IInstance#shutdown()}}. Here are 200 runs for [j8-j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/723/workflows/097fe8bd-f374-4689-b4ee-889bc1681dd5/jobs/7386], [j8-j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/723/workflows/097fe8bd-f374-4689-b4ee-889bc1681dd5/jobs/7387] and [j11-j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/723/workflows/46a247ce-5bdf-4b55-a6f7-e36001c08aab/jobs/7381]. From those, there is a single timeout in j11-j11 which I'm not sure yet whether it is a CI resources problem or a legit test failure.

I would expect a failure more than a timeout. 

+1 for me.

It seems that with more runs the new test shows some flakiness, as it can be seen for example [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/726/workflows/b9870200-2e20-4654-8428-471adbe77b7d/jobs/7417]. I think this is indeed caused by restarting the nodes while performing writes. Some of those writes somehow make it into the down nodes, so there are less hints than expected, which makes the test fail.

I have modified the test to use a message filter dropping mutations instead of restarting the nodes, and it seems to be enough to stabilise the test: [j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/747/workflows/b81f0ea0-2054-4f67-9d9d-fa8e2e3ccfaf], [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/747/workflows/3f8c9e17-39e1-4980-a024-04068a6c2f6f].

+1
