From hbase-common/src/main/resources/hbase-default.xml :
{code}
  <property>
    <name>hbase.client.write.buffer</name>
    <value>2097152</value>
{code}
Why was the change needed ?

[~tedyu@apache.org] Because {code} HTable ht = new HTable();{code} doesn't set writeBufferSize. The fix is to add the line {code}ht.setWriteBufferSize{code}. to set writeBufferSize otherwise its value is 0. The default you mentioned is only for default config value while the above case is that we don't even use the config "hbase.client.write.buffer" at all. Thanks.
