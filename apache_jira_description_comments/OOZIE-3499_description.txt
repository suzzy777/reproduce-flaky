All the tests from TestLiteWorkflowAppParser, where global configurations are used are failing because with Java11 the order of the properties is not the same as with Java8. 
{code:xml}
<global>
 <job-tracker>${foo}</job-tracker>
 <name-node>bar</name-node>
 <configuration>
 <property>
 <name>a</name>
 <value>A</value>
 </property>
 <property>
 <name>b</name>
 <value>B</value>
 </property>
 </configuration>
</global>{code}

With Java 11 will have the same order as in the xml, but with Java 8 the order is changed, and we are asserting to the "wrong" order.
