commit 2f8c3d17691df767bb0fac1274077bbc8b6da0f0
Author: Chun-Hung Hsiao <chhsiao@apache.org>
Date: Wed Apr 10 10:07:20 2019 +0200

Fixed `AgentFailoverHTTPExecutorUsingResourceProviderResources` flake.

The test is flaky because:

* It assumes the mock RP never reregisters, which might not be true.

* It does not wait for the task and executor to be reaped, which would
lead to a race between containerizer destroy and test teardown and
cause cgroups cleanup to fail.

* It fast-forwards the clock, which might lead to containerizer
timed out to wait for all nested containers to be killed.

* It assumes that the framework only receives two status updates,
which might not be true.
