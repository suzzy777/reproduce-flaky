Attached logs for both cases, when it passes and fails.
Link (temporary) to logs:
passed: http://104.198.223.121:8080/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/33449/artifact/hbase-server/target/surefire-reports/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestMultiRespectsLimits-output.txt/*view*/
failed: http://104.198.223.121:8080/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/33455/artifact/hbase-server/target/surefire-reports/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestMultiRespectsLimits-output.txt/*view*/

Correlating across more runs, whenever the tests passes, it does so within 10-30sec of 3min deadline for medium tests.
So i think we can make it pass by just increasing the timeout.

But I'm a bit skeptical after seeing all those long GC pauses (10sec +) in the log. Test code doesn't seem to be doing anything that intensive. Are we mismanaging the memory somewhere?
