ZK uses Java NIO to create ServerSorcket's from ServerSocketChannels. Under windows, the ipv4 and ipv6 is implemented independently, and Java seems that it cannot reuse the same socket channel for both ipv4 and ipv6 sockets. We are getting "java.net.SocketException: Address family not supported by protocol
family" exceptions. When, ZK client resolves "localhost", it gets both v4 127.0.0.1 and v6 ::1 address, but the socket channel cannot bind to both v4 and v6.
The problem is reported as:

Although the JDK bug is reported as resolved, I have tested with jdk1.6.0_33 without any success. Although JDK7 seems to have fixed this problem.
