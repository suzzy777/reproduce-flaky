It looks like the {{mllib.stat.JavaStatisticsSuite.testCorr}} test has become flaky:

https://spark-tests.appspot.com/tests/org.apache.spark.mllib.stat.JavaStatisticsSuite/testCorr

The first observed failure was in https://spark-tests.appspot.com/builds/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-2.6/816

{code}
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<0.9986422261219262> but was:<0.9986422261219272>
	at org.apache.spark.mllib.stat.JavaStatisticsSuite.testCorr(JavaStatisticsSuite.java:75)
{code}

I'm going to ignore this test now, but we need to come back and fix it.
