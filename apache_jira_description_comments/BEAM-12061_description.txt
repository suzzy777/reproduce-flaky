The failures in the SQL postcommit started at https://ci-beam.apache.org/view/PostCommit/job/beam_PostCommit_SQL/6092/

There are no changes indicated in that build, so it seems likely to be infrastructure/environment or a flake that just got unlucky.

Some error messages about being unable to contact broker, but I didn't look deeply as I wanted first to file a bug to track.
