This appears to be a concourse issue - we are running the acceptance tests in parallel and not in containers.

A bit more detail ...

Acceptance tests by design use default ports for running servers and locators, so when tests run in parallel without the isolation of containers there are inevitably port conflicts. Failures typically show error logs something like
{code:java}
[INFO  01:35:33.190 UTC] (cluster-setup): (2) Executing - start server --name=server --security-properties-file=/tmp/junit1230333947702514837/security.properties

Some of the {{AcceptanceTests}} require external services such as mysql or postgres which are in docker containers. To avoid docker-in-docker problems CI for these tests are not containerized.

Work on containerizing {{AcceptanceTests}} is in progress on PR#2368, against GEODE-5590 which is now tagged as a duplicate of this JIRA

GEODE-5601: Serialize running of acceptance tests in lieu of containerizing them (#2389)

* GEODE-5601: Serialize running of acceptance tests in lieu of containerizing them

Fix flaky AccpetanceTest runs by running them serially. Note that this does make a
hit on the runtime (~ 10% in testing) for this category of test.

Closing this as fixed, although there is still room for improving AcceptanceTest runs. After merging this fix, the total runtime for this category increased by about 4 min (22 -> 26).
