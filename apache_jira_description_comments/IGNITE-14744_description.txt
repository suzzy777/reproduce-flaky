Currently, the snapshot restore procedure can be performed in the same cluster topology. This means that it will not work in topologies with a different number of cluster nodes (for example, fewer nodes) since it requires a complete rebuild of the index for the cache groups.
We must support the restore procedure on different cluster topologies.
