[~skye], any update on this?  Was this the hdfs-scanner shadowing the hdfs-scanner's parse_status_ issue?

Yes, I'll close it, sorry for the delay.

IMPALA-2376: remove parse_status_ from HdfsParquetScanner

It shadows the parse_status_ defined in HdfsScanner, making it so the
Parquet scanner doesn't pick up a bad parse status set in an
HdfsScanner function.

IMPALA-6560: fix regression test for IMPALA-2376

The test is modified to increase the size of collections allocated.
num_nodes and mt_dop query options are set to make execution as
deterministic as possible.

I looped the test overnight to try to flush out flakiness.

Adds support for row_regex lines in CATCH sections so that we can
match a larger part of the error message.

IMPALA-9596: deflake test_tpch_mem_limit_single_node

This changes the test to use a debug action instead of
trying to hit the memory limit in the right spot, which
has tended to be flaky. This still exercises the error
handling code in the scanner, which was the original
point of the test (see IMPALA-2376).

This revealed an actual bug in the ORC scanner, where
it was not returning the error directly from
AssembleCollection(). Before I fixed that, the scanner
got stuck in an infinite loop when running the test.
