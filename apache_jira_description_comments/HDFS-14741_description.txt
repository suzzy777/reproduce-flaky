RecoverLease should be return false when the file is open or be writing in multiple destinations.

Liks this:

Mount point has multiple destination(ns0 and ns1).

And the file is in ns0 but it is be writing, ns1 doesn't has this file.

In this case *recoverLease* should return false instead of throw FileNotFoundException.
