Tests using parallel multicast processing with timeouts and/or delays frequently fail on the first run when using JUnit5 parallel processing. The multicast target threads are not always scheduled to run before the timeout is exceeded.

These tests usually succeed when rerun as there is less contention.

Annotating the tests with @org.junit.jupiter.api.parallel.Isolated resolves this issue.
