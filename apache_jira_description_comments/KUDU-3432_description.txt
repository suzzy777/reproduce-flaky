The {{TableKeyRangeTest.TestGetTableKeyRange}} scenario added with [cef110b31|https://github.com/apache/kudu/commit/cef110b314f94aadfd3274932e710d05b7cec97c] shows signs of flakiness.  At least, I saw the following failure (DEBUG build configuration):
{noformat}
src/kudu/client/client-test.cc:8798: Failure
Expected: (token_size_a) != (token_size_b), actual: 14 vs 14
{noformat}

I'm attaching the full log of the failed test scenario.
