[~ibessonov] Looks good to me! Thanks!

Let's merge to the master branch first and wait for flaky failures (if any)

[~mmuzaf] I'm all for merging it to master but I can't do it by myself.

What flaky failures do you mean? Are you afraid that this change will add some?

[~mmuzaf] I believe the change like this can't lead to flaky tests.

[~ibessonov] I've took a look and have some comments about cosmetic. Could you please fix it?

[~agura] thank you, I will also encapsulate mutable public fields as we discussed privately.
