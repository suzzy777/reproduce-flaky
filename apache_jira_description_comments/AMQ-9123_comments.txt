Hi. I am a beginner in open source. Will this be a good first issue for me to work on? If not, can someone suggest one to me to start contributing?

Hey [~shikhar97gupta], I think it could be a good first issue. I made quick change to clear all the collections ([here|https://github.com/apache/activemq/commit/691bd836e624478361716c4a4091895f9ab472d4]) and ran all the tests just to see if anything unexpected popped up. I just checked and it looks like there was some flaky test that failed so I just restarted the tests. Anyway, we probably want a bunch of unit tests that validate that all the collections are empty after we add subscribers, topics, queues, etc. If you want to take a crack at it go for it (y)

Yes I would like to give it a shot. Thanks.

 

 

BTW, I was able to get a clean build with all tests passing with the collections being cleared ( [commit|https://github.com/apache/activemq/commit/691bd836e624478361716c4a4091895f9ab472d4] ) so I suspect there won't be any problems with this.
