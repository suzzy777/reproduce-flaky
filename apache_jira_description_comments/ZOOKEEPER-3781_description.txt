Hi,

In our deployment, we are using zookeepers as Kafka quorum.

Recently we upgraded Zookeeper from 3.4.14 to 3.5.7.
During the upgrade, we enabled snapshot.trust.empty and removed it after.
However, about 25% of zookeepers (all on 3.5.7) are not creating snapshot files, so they keep crashing on reboot with ERROR.

{noformat}
ERROR [main:QuorumPeer@937] - Unable to load database on disk
<http://java.io|java.io>.IOException: No snapshot found, but there are log entries. Something is broken!
{noformat}

Nothing suspecious did I find from the zookeeper log.

I managed to reproduce the issue with the data from our servers, I put them in the attachment.
