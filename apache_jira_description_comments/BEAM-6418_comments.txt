Thanks for reporting this. Should be fixed by https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7489

The first cron job after the merge was #815. So far no failures, will close this in a bit if it doesn't fail: https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Cron/

Could it be flaky? #815 was successful but #820 failed (https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Cron/820/console)

The Jenkins test environment is very memory constraint. We get killed by the host OS (exit code 137) while running tests for two FlinkRunner versions (1.5/1.6) in parallel. Initially, this problem became visible after adding the 1.7 target, but it looks like the general memory load of the tests has increased. Thus, I will also disable test execution for 1.6.

Generally speaking, it seems to be a Jenkins problem because the test JVM can't acquire the max memory that it has been provided (currently set to max 4GB per parallel instance) without getting killed by the host OS.

Looks like the issue is resolved. I've backported the serial execution to the release branch.
