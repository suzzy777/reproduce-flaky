The {{TServerQuiescingITest.TestQuiescingServerDoesntTriggerElections}} test scenario sometimes fails (TSAN builds) in {{CreateWorkloadTable()}} with the messages like below:

{noformat}
F0127 03:48:05.405407   458 test_workload.cc:330] Timed out: Timed out waiting for Table Creation
{noformat}

It seems the custom setting for the {{\-\-raft_heartbeat_interval_ms}} flag might be too low in case of TSAN builds.

The full log is attached.
