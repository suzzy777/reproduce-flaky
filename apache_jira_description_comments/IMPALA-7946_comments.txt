IMPALA-7946: Use original timeout in THREAD_POOL_TASK_TIMED_OUT message

When SynchronousThreadPool::SynchronousOffer() times out, it can
sometimes print the wrong time out in the error message. This happens
because it is enforcing a total timeout across multiple operations.
For example, if there is a total timeout of 5 seconds and the first
step takes 1 second, the remaining step is given a 4 second timeout
to enforce the total timeout. However, this 4 second timeout should
not be expressed in the THREAD_POOL_TASK_TIMED_OUT error message
if the task times out. Instead, SynchronousOffer() should always use
the original timeout as the internal time out is unimportant to users.

This changes the code to make the error message always use the
original timeout.
