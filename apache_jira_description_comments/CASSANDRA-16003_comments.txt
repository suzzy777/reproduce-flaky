It would also be good to fix the asserts as they are not actionable; they should inform what happened to cause the issue (such as print out stderr if it is expected to be empty but was not)

[~dcapwell] Thanks for raising this one, good catch!. I don't think the problem lies in ToolRunner not being portable, but the actual stdErr we are doing now and we didn't do previously. So this is just the natural consequence of us improving in tooling testing imo :-)

I have added a super short PR, fortunately, which seems to work when I repro'ed locally. Would you be so kind to review please? Thx in advance.

Edit: Latest code on CASSANDRA-15583 will be blocked on this as well, so the sooner we can merge this one the better #collaborating

left comment in PR

Overall LGTM +1 (with small comment).

Thanks [~dcapwell]. I left an explanation for the choice I made. If it sgt you feel free to commit, otherwise let me know and I'll push a commit.

left a comment, would be good to address

Thx [~dcapwell] . Changed as per your suggestion

Hi [~dcapwell] I know you're probably super-busy or even on holidays, but I am starting to be piling tickets behind this one so getting this one merged would very useful to me. Would you mind I ping some other reviewer/committer to get this merged? apologies again for being a pain, but I am starting to have too many local branches based off other local ones not merged yet and my env is becoming too brittle :)

+1

Yellow: known flaky tests only.

Reran the tests on the env that found the issue, tests now pass there.

Thanks for your hard work!

Thank you so much :)

#justfyi we didn't think of adding this test :shrug:Â  [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/704/files#diff-ff6938d8ab4ea304113d733d53f84e10R41] At least we'll add it there :)
