Note that this requires the HDFS to get this generation ID together with change ID from sentry server and send it to the sentry server in following requests.

SENTRY-1782 will handle that part. This will only persist the new identifier.

This patch only adds a new column to the MAuthzPathsMapping, and makes sure the code works with it.

[~akolb] Tests are flaky. I will investigate them anyway. But could you review the patch in the meantime? I added a link to RB.

[~spena] The description talks about a new identifier, but the code adds much more - please update this JIRA with the description of actual changes.

What do you think about the new subject? It's hard to use a better one as part of the new schema, then new API should be changed and/or created.

[~spena] Can you clarify why do you want to keep actual path mappings as part of {{MHiveMetastoreImage}}? I don't see it actually being used anywhere. It looks like the only thing you really care about is the hmsImageID which is, essentially, a generation of the full image. Do you use it for anything?

If you don't use it, the row is very small and you shouldn't worry about multiple entries and don't need the artiicial singleton with preventConcurrencyCommits. The table becomes very simple then - it can contain essentially a single column - the generation ID.

What am I missing?
