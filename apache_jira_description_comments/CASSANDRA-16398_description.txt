The terms, "ACCESS TO ALL DATACENTERS" (for role control,) are introduced in CASSANDRA-13985. 
They are not marked as unreserved keywords. So in the non-role related DDL statements, for example, create table statement, the parser fails.
 
cqlsh> CREATE TABLE test.test_access ( foo text PRIMARY KEY, access text, bar text);
SyntaxException: line 1:54 mismatched input 'access' expecting ')' (... foo text PRIMARY KEY, [access]...)
 
cqlsh> CREATE TABLE test.test_datacenters ( foo text PRIMARY KEY, datacenters text, bar text);
SyntaxException: line 1:59 mismatched input 'datacenters' expecting ')' (... foo text PRIMARY KEY, [datacenters]...)
 
Since ACCESS and DATACENTERS are only applicable to the role defining statements. We should mark them as unreserved keywords in order to allow to use them in the DDL statement.
