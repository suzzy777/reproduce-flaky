IMPALA-6601: fix ASAN issue in row-batch-serialize-test

Constructing a StringValue with a std::string requires
that the std::string remain valid for as long as the
StringValue is valid. row-batch-serialize-test's
TestRowBatchLimits uses a temporary string value that
does not have the lifetime needed. When the memory is
reused, ASAN complains.

This changes TestRowBatchLimits to use strings with an
appropriate lifetime. The test now runs successfully
under ASAN.
