Chunk cache is enabled by default and doesnâ€™t have a flag to disable without impacting networking.  In performance testing 4.0 against 3.0 I found that reads were slower in 4.0 and after profiling found that the ChunkCache was partially to blame; after disabling the chunk cache, read performance had improved.
