[~Mmuzaf], as far as I know you've also researched activate-deactivate, so could I ask to do a favor and review this change?

[~sergey-chugunov] couple of suspicious failures here are  
- ZookeeperDiscoverySpiTestSuite1: ZookeeperDiscoverySpiTest.testRandomTopologyChanges_CloseClients (fail rate 0,0%)      
- ZookeeperDiscoverySpiTestSuite1: ZookeeperDiscoverySpiTest.testTopologyChangeMultithreaded_RestartZk_CloseClients (fail rate 0,0%) 

- IgniteCacheFailoverTestSuite: IgniteAtomicLongChangingTopologySelfTest.testClientQueueCreateCloseFailover (fail rate 0,0%) 
- IgniteCacheFailoverTestSuite: IgniteAtomicLongChangingTopologySelfTest.testClientSetCreateCloseFailover (fail rate 0,0%) 

I quite sure it is just 0.0 statisctic and tests are flaky, but could you please double check it anyway?


[~dpavlov],

Thanks for spotting the situation with IgniteAtomicLongChangingTopologySelfTest tests. 
I found an issue and pushed a fix, will rerun TC to make sure that tests are OK now.

[~dpavlov], [~sergey-chugunov],

Folks,
As we have stable execution timeouts for some test suites (e.g. currently at Activate\Deactivate cluster suite) TeamCity Run:All would not show as that we on the safe side with this fix. 

Thus I think it's a good practice to have for PR a special reproducer for described case.
I've reviewed test cases added by IGNITE-8657 {{testClientReconnectOnExchangeHistoryExhaustion}}, {{testClientInForceServerModeStopsOnExchangeHistoryExhaustion}} and they are not cover this issue.

What do you think?

IGNITE-8853 will be fixed as part of this issue.

Looks good for me. We need to wait TC run and if it's ok, this branch can be merged.

[~sergey-chugunov],

Make sense. Changes looks good to me.
Can you clarify: {{CacheSerializableTransactionsTest#testIncrementTxRestart}} – I see fails on TC but can't reprcoduce error locally. What should I tune?

[~Mmuzaf],

Could you send me a link to TC run with failed test? I don't see it in TC report, this particular test seems passing: [link|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Cache5&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F4288%2Fhead&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv]

[~sergey-chugunov], thanks, merged to master.
