^^ above trace is for org.apache.oozie.client.TestWorkflowClient.testSla

attaching a partial patch to be included in final patch for always failing test in TestSLAEventGeneration

Other flaky test is TestSLAEventGeneration.testCoordinatorActionCommands
{code}
        new CoordKillXCommand(jobId).call();
        ehs.new EventWorker().run();
        ehs.getEventQueue().poll(); //ignore duration event
        slaEvent = (SLACalcStatus) ehs.getEventQueue().poll();
{code}
slaEvent is null, which cause exception. reason is, actions have been already in terminal state, and no actions killed in CoordKillXCommand. hence no new jobevent message pushed to queue.

on top of Mona's patch, i did modification. some of test failure fixed, but still TestSLAEventGeneration.testCoordinatorActionCommands sometimes throw following error (seemingly at tearDown, wondering whether order of service destroy matters)

{code}
Exception in thread "pool-10-thread-1" java.lang.AbstractMethodError
	at org.apache.thrift.ProcessFunction.process(ProcessFunction.java:51)
	at org.apache.thrift.TBaseProcessor.process(TBaseProcessor.java:39)
	at org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.TSetIpAddressProcessor.process(TSetIpAddressProcessor.java:48)
	at org.apache.thrift.server.TThreadPoolServer$WorkerProcess.run(TThreadPoolServer.java:206)
	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.runTask(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:886)
	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:908)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:680)
{code}

That error should be fine. It is hcat server error on shutdown.

From our offline discussion, there was a suggestion to fix the use of ActionCheckXCommandForTest in TestEventGeneration testcase. Do you want to include that minor fix in this patch since its about job notifications that affects sla, or leave as-is for now?

Unable to reproduce test error in comment#1

Attaching small 1-line change in KillXCommand which was queueing Wf Action events even for ControlNodes e.g. :start:, :end: etc. That solves the flaky unit test TestSLAEventGeneration. Running the complete suite now to check

+1 pending jenkins

Made additional few line changes in SLA test case to avoid timing flakiness
