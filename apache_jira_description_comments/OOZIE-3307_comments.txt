[~sabir1] this seems much more a YARN issue to me. For YARN container sizing, please see *[appropriate section|https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Batch-Processing-and-Workflow/How-to-set-yarn-nodemanager-pmem-check-enabled/td-p/30134]* of YARN community forum.

Although this particular error message can be solved by tweaking yarn settings, there is an issue with Oozie itself. It allocated 2GB Yarn container, however, I don't see any Xmx option above. On many systems, default Xmx is above 2GB, so with this default configuration, Ozzie AM can easily hit physical memory size limit, and be likewise killed. Oozie 4 used to pass -Xmx1024 to AM by default.

 

Is this a issue that can be discussed in this Jira, or a new one would be more appropriate?

[~vladimir.prus] the issue you mention might be the root cause for the original one.

Can you please point to where Oozie 4.3.0 sets {{-Xmx=1024m}} for {{LauncherMapper}}? Thanks!

I am not sure where Ozzie sets the options, I was looking at the processes with "ps". E.g. I have Ooozie 4, its starts a launcher as container_1532455670006_41980_01_000001, the first line of the log is "Oozie Launcher starts", and "ps" output is this:
{code:java}

Doing the same on cluster with Oozie 5 does not show any -Xmx options.

 

The code that seems relevant is at [https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/3d0843260199799be634dc330d98f1362536fcd5/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/JavaActionExecutor.java#L402]

This code appears removed in master. setJavaOpts will only set options provided in <launcher> element explicitly, and I see no code that would set Xmx automatically.

 

That's right, we do set {{-Xmx}} automatically in MR-based Oozie: [https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/branch-4.3/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/JavaActionExecutor.java#L382-L415] 

It's missing from the Oozie-on-YARN based implementation. Perhaps, based on the resource request, we could limit {{-Xmx}} as  80-90 % of the requested memory to make sure that OOME happens before the container is killed by YARN.

[~andras.piros] could you take care of this?
 # Set {{-Xmx}} to be 80% of the container memory size
 # If it's already defined as a JVM option by the user, let that setting take precedence and don't override it (optional: we can still parse it and print a warning if the settings can lead to the situation described in this ticket)

Right now we use 2GB as default in the container request, to me this looks like a reasonable value.

Thanks [~vladimir.prus] for the code pointers!

[~pbacsko] sure, I'll create a patch in the next few days.

[~pbacsko] there is a patch available, can you please review? Thanks!

Addressed pre-commit issues:
* {{FINDBUGS_DIFF}} error because of complex regexp
* {{RAT}} errors on {{HEAD}} because of incorrect settings

Taking a quick look on the patch it looks like a fine improvement. +1 (pending jenkins) on it.
There are some changes in the root pom.xml which are seemingly unrelated to this issue. Maybe they are leftovers from an other patch you're working on. Please remove them before commit, but don't wait for an other Jenkins build for it.

Thanks for the review [~gezapeti]! Uploaded a new patch that doesn't contain unrelated {{pom.xml}} changes.
