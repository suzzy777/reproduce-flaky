Our export command will execute a function on servers (one at a time) to build up a zip file of the artifacts for that server.  Then, the zip file needs to be sent back to the locator, so that the locator can aggregate together the files from all servers.  However, we need to make sure to chunk/stream the data that we send from server to locator so that neither member will run out of memory if the file is very large.
