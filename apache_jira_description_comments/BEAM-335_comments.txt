Agreed as to likely cause. I'll take a look.

Probably should run a PAssert on each runner in the presubmit. Could be by throwing it into and e2e test like we run today, or by a small selection of other tests.

Another thought is that the TestDataflowPipelineRunner could possibly be a more generic TestPipelineRunner(<actual runner>) in which case we can get coverage via local Flink & Spark endpoints more cheaply.

At this point we are back to the usual issues.
