[~martijnvisser] any thoughts?

I am the [Flink Jira Bot|https://github.com/apache/flink-jira-bot/] and I help the community manage its development. I see this issues has been marked as Minor but is unassigned and neither itself nor its Sub-Tasks have been updated for 180 days. I have gone ahead and marked it "stale-minor". If this ticket is still Minor, please either assign yourself or give an update. Afterwards, please remove the label or in 7 days the issue will be deprioritized.


This issue was labeled "stale-minor" 7 days ago and has not received any updates so it is being deprioritized. If this ticket is actually Minor, please raise the priority and ask a committer to assign you the issue or revive the public discussion.
