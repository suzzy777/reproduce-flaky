I've moved the state of this work here from [#7823|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7823], and will keep it up to date.

[~rdub] I think I was able to successfully avoid converting from/to MonitoringInfos and return a collection of MonitoringInfos all the way to JobServicePipelineResult so that it could be converted to MetricsResults only once. It's a work in progress and it can be seen here: [https://github.com/lgajowy/beam/commit/228e4a0e7a6231416ce3d467e7d821aefd3ff93a]

If you're not working on this anymore I will assign this issue to me. If you are still working on this - I'm happy to communicate! :)

Sounds great [~ŁukaszG], it's all yours, thanks!

Hey [~ŁukaszG], just checking in – have you been able to make further progress on this? Any blockers?

I'm glad that you asked. :) I got drawn away by other things but before that I was able to pass MonitoringInfos to PortableRunner successfuly (as described in the comment above). So at least that part should be contributed IMO (not converting to MetricsResults yet). I should have a PR for this in a week or two.

[~ibzib] FYI: I created a draft PR* for this: [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9020] . I'm still fighting some problems and testing it but decided to share in case I'm going the wrong direction. 

 

* [https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/] - cool feature btw. :)

the JobServer part is done - all kinds of MonitroingInfos are forwarded through grpc to PortableRunners (sdk side). The PortableRunners can decide how to digest them (e.g. create MetricsResult from monitoring infos where possible).
