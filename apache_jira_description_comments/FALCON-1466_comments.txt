Root cause: Proxy user UT"s in the test set up configure the proxy user group and host in RuntimeProperties. In RuntimeProperties if INSTANCE is null then it is initialized , also it spins a thread to dynamically load it. If when the tests run INSTANCE is null then there ia a race condition where after proxy user config is set it can be overwritten by the thread that is spun in DynamicLoader.run(). Thread is spun just after iniitng INSTANCE and hence INSTANCE need not have to be updated when the thread starts running. To remove the flakiness moved Thread.sleep to beginning of DynamicLoader.run().
