Thanks [~adhoot] for the patch. I looked at it & just had a couple of comments:
   1. Can we have _toResource(ReservationRequest request)_ in a Reservation utility class rather than in _InMemoryReservationAllocation_
   2. I feel we can update the constructor of _InMemoryReservationAllocation_ to take in _Map<ReservationInterval, Resource>_ instead of _Map<ReservationInterval, ReservationRequest>_ so that we do the translation only once. This should simplify the state in GreedyReservationAgent also.

Thanks [~adhoot] for the updated patch. Overall it looks good, a few minor nits:
   * Can we rename _ReservationUtil_ to _ReservationSystemUtil_ to avoid confusion.
   * In _TestInMemoryPlan_, can we use *allocations* instead of *allocs* to minimize the diff.
   * In _TestInMemoryReservationAllocation_, we can continue using the previous constructor for non-gang allocations as the flag is required only for gang.
   * There is a redundant format change in _TestInMemoryReservationAllocation_ :
bq. -    Assert.assertEquals(allocations, rAllocation.getAllocationRequests());
+    Assert.assertEquals(allocations,
+        rAllocation.getAllocationRequests());

[~kasha] [~jianhe] appreciate your review of this.

Patch generally looks good, and I spoke with [~subru] that explained me why you are making these changes, and overall makes sense. 

A couple nits and then I am ok to commit this:
1) I think it is nicer to have types in HashMap<> and TreeMap<> initializations.
2) In other places you did this change already, but in TestRLESparseResourceAllocation  you have a generateAllocation that still produces ReservationRequests and then you immediately convert to Resource. Probably easier to change generateAllocation

Thanks for the work on this patch.

Addressed feedback. 
I feel the types are already on the left side so should be ok to be left out on the right side. But not a big deal so removed it.

Test failure seems unrelated and filed as flaky test in YARN-3342
Checkstyle issue is preexisting (number of parameters > 7)

+1 I checked the failing test on both trunk and branch-2 and they pass on my box.

I committed this to trunk and branch-2. 

Thanks [~adhoot] and [~subru]!

Thanks [~curino] and [~subru]!

Thanks [~adhoot] for the patch and [~curino] for reviewing and committing it!
