[~aihuaxu] Thanks for investigation. IIUC, we need to recompile Tez for hadoop 3.  Do you know if we can get a single build of Tez for this incompat or Tez will need to publish 2 sets of jars if Tez still continues to support both hadoop versions on master.


[~ashutoshc] I think Tez need to publish 2 sets of jars to support both hadoop versions since  {{org.apache.log4j.Level DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL}} and {{String DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL}} are not compatible with each other.

TEZ-3252 is the umbrella jira for hadoop 3.0 support. Right now Tez master compiles with hadoop trunk. Please specify the problem detail in title and description.

[~aplusplus] Issue here is a binary compatibility. Tez compiles with both hadoop versions, but Tez compiled against 2.x hadoop cant be used with hadoop 3 jars in classpath at runtime. Reason is as [~aihuaxu] laid out.

[~kshukla] Can you take a look at my patch? I'm going to fix this by using our own copy of string instead of relying on Hadoop's.

+1 looks good to me.

[~aplusplus] Can you please also release snapshot jars for 0.9.1 with this fix so that we can use this in hive?

Thanks [~kshukla] for review! Patch was committed to master branch.
[~ashutoshc] AFAIK snapshot jars is released automatically by jenkins. Probably it'll be ready tomorrow.

Thanks [~aplusplus] for working on it to unblock hive.

[~aplusplus] I have a question on the change. I  only see that we removed toString() call but should we update the pom.xml to point to hadoop3? I guess tez binary may still try to find {{Level DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL;}} rather than {{String DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL;}}? Will you be able to verify tez jar against hadoop3 jar? Thanks.

[~aihuaxu] We no longer use JobConf.DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL from Hadoop. MRJobConfig is a Tez class which has our own copy of string DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL.

I see. Thanks [~aplusplus] I missed that. 

[~aplusplus] Jars haven't shown up on maven yet. Can you take a look and publish these jars?

[~ashutoshc] I found the Jenkins job that built Tez. It seems recent two build failed due to test failure (likely flaky). I manually triggered another jenkins run.

https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/Tez/job/Tez-Build/

[~ashutoshc] The jenkins run I kicked off now succeed. New jars are now in snapshot repository. Sorry for the delay.

Thanks [~aplusplus]  Can you confirm version string is 0.9.1-SNAPSHOT ?

[~ashutoshc] Yes, new jars were published to 0.9.1-SNAPSHOT.
