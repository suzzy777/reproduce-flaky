There is a deadlock condition in the data channel code that occurs when a user function fails while processing an element. The producer for the data channel is continuing to send information across a channel, but the intended consumer has stopped listening. Unfortunately, this channel blocks the entire data channel, blocking data for any other DoFn that might be running, causing the whole worker to deadlock.
