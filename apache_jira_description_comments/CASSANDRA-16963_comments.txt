Made one comment in the PR and ran the tests locally. Seeing {{test_simple_sequential_repair}}, {{test_simple_parallel_repair}}, and a few others fail with an error that looks something like this:

{noformat}
test_simple_sequential_repair failed and was not selected for rerun.
	<class 'KeyError'>
	'fully_qualified_cf'
	[<TracebackEntry /Users/maedhroz/Projects/Apache/cassandra-dtest/repair_tests/repair_test.py:363>, <TracebackEntry /Users/maedhroz/Projects/Apache/cassandra-dtest/repair_tests/repair_test.py:453>, <TracebackEntry /Users/maedhroz/Projects/Apache/cassandra-dtest/repair_tests/repair_test.py:112>, <TracebackEntry /Users/maedhroz/Projects/Apache/cassandra-dtest/tools/data.py:30>]
{noformat}

[~maedhroz] sorry about that, I've done it the right way first, but then somehow thought that Python string interpolation works slightly differently. Maybe it was another language that allowed string interpolation right from variable names. I've fixed it now.

+1

(I do have a local trunk run of {{repair_tests/repair_test.py}} in flight, but I assume it'll be fine now. I'll post if it isn't.)
