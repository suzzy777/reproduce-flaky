I don't see anything wrong with the test case, according to the log I think the query failed as expected. I wonder if this could be related to [~sailesh]'s comment about a potential get_log() race in IMPALA-5198

This somehow flew under my radar. I'd say we can pick up further investigation if it happens again as that race is very rare.
