Thank you for the investigation [~tarmstrong]. Agree, I think this is what happens occasionally, probably based on OS load.

I believe we could fix the flakiness by enforcing the order of events, added an extra expect call to wait for the interrupt to happen and then submit the query.

IMPALA-10119: Fix impala-shell history duplication test

The flaky test was
TestImpalaShellInteractive.test_history_does_not_duplicate_on_interrupt

The test failed with timeout error when the interrupt signal arrived
later after the next test query was started. The impala-shell output was
^C instead of the expected query result.

This change adds an additional blocking expect call to wait for the
interrupt signal to arrive before sending in the next query.
