@Uma:
Can you attach test output to this issue ?
Was this seen on trunk build ?


Hi Ted,
 I just ran this test locally several times. Tests failed 2 times and all the other times they passed.

I attached the log when running this test.

I am also looking into it. If you get some clue, please let me know.

Yes, Ted. this is on trunk.

The test failure has become almost consistent in Hadoop QA builds.
Here is one recent example:
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/1894//testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver/TestSplitTransactionOnCluster/testShutdownFixupWhenDaughterHasSplit/

This happens because the tests before the failed test does some regionserver abort.  
What happens is sometimes the HLog split takes time and it happens only when testShutdownFixupWhenDaughterHasSplit is going on.  So the regions count changes thus failing the testcase.
One simple way is to stop and start the cluster every time.

From https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-TRUNK/3000/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver/TestSplitTransactionOnCluster/testShutdownFixupWhenDaughterHasSplit/:

{code}
We can see that region 73830568ee93434ba97f7b5ade48ae30 didn't finish splitting after the last 'Waiting on region to split' was printed.
In split() method:
{code}
    while (ProtobufUtil.getOnlineRegions(server).size() <= regionCount) {
      LOG.debug("Waiting on region to split");
{code}
I think the above method should be improved: if a region is moved onto server, the loop would exit but number of daughter regions wouldn't be 2.

I ran TestSplitTransactionOnCluster#testShutdownFixupWhenDaughterHasSplit 5 times with the patch - they passed.

Integrated to trunk.

Will resolve after at least 5 trunk builds where this test passes.

Thanks for the review, Stack.
