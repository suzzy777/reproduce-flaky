commit 708902d6f207b6f93c94b3589a31d54c812a7657 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)

    Fixed a flaky resource provider test.

    An agent could run into a registration timeout and try to register a
    second time. In that case the master will acknowledge the registration
    twice. This is expected. As a result the agent would send
    'UpdateSlaveMessage' twice. The test expected the second
    'UpdateSlaveMessage' to be the result of a resource provider
    registration, hence the test would fail. This has been resolved by
    controlling the clock during registration to avoid registration
    timeouts.
