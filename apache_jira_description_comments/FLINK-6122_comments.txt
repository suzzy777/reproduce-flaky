    [FLINK-6122] add TravisCI build status to README.md

----


I'm not sure if we want to merge this change. We once had the travis build status badge in our readme, but decided to remove it, because it often shows "Build failed" due to travis issues etc.
This gives people the impression that our builds are very unstable .

Implemented in 486f724 (master).

I am with Robert here. In fact, many builds are marked as "failed" these days simply due to exceeding the 50 minute limit in one profile.
The status kind of makes the project look bad without a reason.

We have quasi never a broken master, and currently not even flaky tests :-)
For a code base of that size, that's a remarkable job by the community, I think
 Would be a pity if this is reflected differently to the works for reasons of timeouts and build infrastructure issues.

I am +1 for removing the tag.
