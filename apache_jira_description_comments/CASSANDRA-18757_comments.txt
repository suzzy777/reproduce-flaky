[~blambov] good to go? I can do the usual builds etc, may even appear in beta1.

btw, was not that done on purpose? 

I think it is a leftover from a refactoring that (among other things) fixed CASSANDRA-18756 in DSE.

Fix LGTM, but it's a shame that no test caught it.

[~ethan.brown] is there any will to add a test in a forseeable future or we just deliver it as it is?

I am running the builds. If we don't add a test we will go without. Merging realistically next week (Monday-ish)

[~smiklosovic] I don't think there are any plans to add a test right now, but if you think it would be a good idea I can add one.

[~ethan.brown] ok so please add one. As I read it, you do not seem to object the idea. If it is not in beta1 it can be still added later, in rc1 or something like that ... If you made that test the next week that would be great. Nowhere to hurry, let's just do this "properly".

Thank you for the test, [~ethan.brown] , I am going to build this, as usually, and let you know.

[~ethan.brown]  I am not able to run a multiplexer in my CI because there is a timeout of 1 hour in my jobs. The whole test changes you did take like 5 minutes locally and it adds up pretty quickly. (the test you rewrote just recently). Would you mind to lower the wait there from 1 minute to 30 seconds, for example? Is it really necessary to wait so long? 

Another solution is to lower the number of the tests but there is a rule we try to stick to that we run any (changed) test 500 times to rule out any flakiness. I would have to split it into two runs for 250 for example which is a little bit ... uncomfortable.

I naively tried to lower the wait from 1 minute to 30s but it fails. Maybe there is some knob to turn to change it from 1 minute to 30 seconds? What influences that 1 minute gap?

How about splitting this into separate tests for the 4 cases? I.e. have the four calls in {{testIgnoreOverlaps}} run in separate {{@Test}}-annotated methods?

That might work too, so then I will run just a test method just added? 

I run it in 25 containers and limit is 1 hour so I have 25*60=1500 minutes to run 500 tests which is 3 minutes per test. (or per test method if I run just that one).

There is also 8 minutes limit for any unit test here (1)

[~smiklosovic] I split the test into 4 separate tests (1 for each case).  The reason for the 1 minute wait is to allow the {{overlapIterator}} to refresh.  {{runMayThrow()}} in {{CompactionTask.java}} only refreshes the {{overlapIterator}} if 1 minute has passed since the last refresh.

Tests look good, repeated test completed with no failures: [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/blambov/cassandra?branch=CASSANDRA-18757]

[~smiklosovic], do you give a second approval so that I can commit this?

+1
