Due to several recent changes, the native client fails to compile on Windows:
# ZOOKEEPER-827 (read-only mode) mismatched a function return type between the declaration and definition.
# ZOOKEEPER-1626 (monotonic clock for tolerance to time adjustments) added an include of unistd.h, which does not exist on Windows.
# Additionally, ZOOKEEPER-1626 did not implement a code path for accessing the Windows monotonic clock.
