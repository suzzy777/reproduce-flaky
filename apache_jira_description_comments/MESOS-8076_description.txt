I'm observing {{ROOT_MountDiskResource/PersistentVolumeTest.SharedPersistentVolumeRescindOnDestroy/0}} being flaky on our internal CI. From what I see in the logs, when {{framework1}} accepts an offer, creates volumes, launches a task, and kills it right after, the executor might manage to register in-between and hence an unexpected {{TASK_RUNNING}} status update is sent. To fix this, one approach is to explicitly wait for {{TASK_RUNNING}} before attempting to kill the task.
