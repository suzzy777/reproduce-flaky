/cc [~mdrob], because I remember him talking about this kind of issue before so maybe I've just filed a dup.

Last time I had to do this, I used basically this recipe:

{code}
mvn clean package -DskipTests
for i in {1..100}; do
  mvn test -q -Dtest=$TEST
  echo $? >> results
done
echo $TEST is $(grep -c 1 results) % flaky.
{code}

I use this script on my lappy.  Making it job sounds like it could be useful.

edit: removing private repo link and adding code instead

{code}
#!/bin/bash

CMD="$@"
N=${N:-5}
echo "N = $N"
for i in `seq $N`
do
  $CMD
  RET=$?
  if [ $RET != 0 ]; then
    echo "Failed on iteration $i"
    exit $RET
  fi
done
echo "Succeeded $i iterations"
{code}
