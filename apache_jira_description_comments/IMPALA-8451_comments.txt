Hi [~tarmstrong], can we target this on 3.4.0?

IMPALA-8451,IMPALA-8905: enable admission control for dockerised tests

This gives us some additional coverage for using admission
control in a simple but realistic configuration.

What are the implications of this change for test stability and
flakiness?

On one hand were are adding some more unpredictability
to tests, because they may be queued for an arbitrary amount of
time. On the other, we can prevent queries from contending over
memory. Currently we rely on luck to prevent concurrent queries
from forcing each other out-of-memory.

I think the unpredictability from the queueing is
preferable, because we can generally work around these by
fixing tests that are sensitive to being queued, whereas
contention over memory requires us to use crude workarounds
like forcing tests to execute serially.

Added observability for the configured queue wait time for each pool.
I noticed that I did not have a direct way to observe the effective
value when I set configs. This is IMPALA-8905.

I had to tweak tests in a few ways:
* Tests with large strings needed higher memory limits.
* Hardcoded instances of default-pool had to handle root.default
  as well.
* test_query_mem_limit needed to run without a mem_limit. I
  created a special pool root.no-limits with no memory limits
  to allow that.

Testing:
Ran the dockerised build 5-6 times to flush out flaky tests.

IMPALA-9177: Bump min-query-mem-limit for dockerised tests

A couple upstream dockerised test runs have seen
TestTpchQuery.test_tpch query 18 on Kudu hit a memory limit.
This is memory limit comes from the admission control
settings, as admission control is enabled for the dockerised
tests in IMPALA-8451.

This bumps the min-query-mem-limit from 256MB to 300MB to
avoid hitting this memory limit.

Testing:
 - Ran GVO. Dockerised tests did not change in run length.
