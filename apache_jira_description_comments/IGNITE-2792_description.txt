*Problem*
Currently if user set his custom TransactionConfiguration, it will be used not only user public caches, but by internal Ignite caches as well. This could lead to some bad situations, such a transaction timeouts, optimistic exceptions, etc..

*Proposed solution*
Ensure that transactional system caches do not use custom TransactionConfiguraton.
