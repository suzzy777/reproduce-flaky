Occasionally, the test case for IMPALA-2376 fails.  e.g.:

http://sandbox.jenkins.cloudera.com/view/Impala/view/Builds%20-%202.3.0%20Release/job/impala-CI-cdh5.5.x/93/testReport/junit/query_test.test_nested_types/TestNestedTypes/test_tpch_exec_option____disable_codegen___False___abort_on_error___1___exec_single_node_rows_threshold___0___batch_size___0___num_nodes___0____table_format__parquet_none_/

The test is expecting a Memory Limit Exceeded failure, but occasionally the query apparently succeeds.  To get the intended coverage, we don't actually need to query to always fail; it'd be good enough if it just usually fails. But I don't know if we have a way to express that.

[~skye], you added this test case, so could you take a look?
