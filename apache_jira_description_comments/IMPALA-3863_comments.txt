I'm not sure if this will be an issue on the read codecoverage job because the AC tests are failing first. If it is, we should make this a blocker.

[~mjacobs] - This looks very much like IMPALA-3794. Unfortunately I don't currently have any idea what causes this, so short of changing the failing assertion to something like {{self.count_minidumps('impalad', minidump_base_dir) > 0}} I'm out of ideas how to fix this immediately. Do you hit this frequently?

I'm closing this, as I'm very confident it's a duplicate of IMPALA-3794, a flaky test that seems to fail very rarely. I'm working on if when I have time, but it might be a while until I figure out what causes this. I'm consistently able to reproduce it after a while of looping for multiple impalads running on a single node, but not for catalogd or statestored, so I don't expect this to affect real-world installations.
