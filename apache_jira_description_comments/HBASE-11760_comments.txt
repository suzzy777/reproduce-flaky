Skimming patch, it looks good.  Let me give you a better review.  What kind of testing have you done [~jxiang]

Thanks. I ran unit tests and ITBLL with DLR off.

Attached a graph showing possible/allowed region state transitions.

That graph is beautiful [~jxiang] We should add to refguide?  (Is 'SPLITTING NEW' a state?)  Should the actors be mentioned in the graph: i.e. who initiates each of the states?

I generated the graph with dot. I was thinking to change the labels to numbers, so that I can add more notes to it. Yes, once it is finalized, we can add it to the refguide.

Attached the new graph with some descriptions.

Excellent!

What do the colors mean?

What about the none-state or does it not exist anymore?

This is zk-less assignment?

This is great Jimmy.

Thanks. There is no none-state any more. Yes, it is for RPC-based assignment. For the colors, red means failure that need OPS attention, blue means transient, grey means something special new region state, green means some terminal states. For state OFFLINE and OPEN, the color is not so accurate. Probably we can have a different color for them.

Attached the graph/doc v2.

Would suggest you add what the colors mean to the doc then lets add to refguide.  Thats really great Jimmy.

Sure. Can I work on the refguide in a separate issue?

Yes  [~jxiang]

What will we do w/ the rb patch?  Want me to go over it again?  Or can you recruit another to give it a gander?

This is for the master branch only. If you can go over it again, it will be great.

Here are more comments on the diagram.  [~misty] how you suggest we integrate Jimmy's fine work into the refguide... dev section I'd say.

Man, should we change OPEN to be named ONLINE?  I suppose OPEN is ok... goes well with OPENING, CLOSE, CLOSING...

Should you say where these states are noted?   Are they in zk or are they only for zk-less hbase assignment?  Are these states written into meta table?  Or also into zk when zk does assign?

We should list FAILED_OPEN and FAILED_CLOSED on the UI.

Do we need CLOSED?  Why not just mark region OFFLINE?

Would be fun to write a formal spec with this for input: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/amazon.html

On the patch, the comments about PENDING_CLOSE going away help... explains why some of the changes.

On the rest of the patch, it is not that large being mostly refactors of log messages and new handling of removed exception as well as instituting max retries in place of while loop.   Let me try and have another go at review.  I got googledy-eyed down in AM..... 





I think this patch good for master branch.  We can fix up issues as they come in.  LGTM.

Integrated into master. Thanks Stack for the review. Yes, this patch is meant for master only.
