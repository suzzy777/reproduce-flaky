With the current implementation we are observing Kinesis throttling due to ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded on the order of hundreds of times per second, regardless of the actual Kinesis throughput. This is because the ShardReadersPool readLoop() method is polling getRecords() as fast as possible.

From the KDS documentation:
{quote}Each shard can support up to five read transactions per second.
{quote}
and
{quote}For best results, sleep for at least 1 second (1,000 milliseconds) between calls to getRecords to avoid exceeding the limit on getRecords frequency.
