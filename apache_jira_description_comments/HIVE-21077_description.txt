Currently, database do not have creation time like we have for tables and partitions.

{noformat}
// namespace for tables
struct Database {
  1: string name,
  2: string description,
  3: string locationUri,
  4: map<string, string> parameters, // properties associated with the database
  5: optional PrincipalPrivilegeSet privileges,
  6: optional string ownerName,
  7: optional PrincipalType ownerType,
  8: optional string catalogName
}
{noformat}

Currently, without creationTime there is no way to identify if the copy of Database which a client has is the same as the one on the server if the name is same. Without object ids creationTime value is the only way currently to identify uniquely a instance of metastore object. It would be good to have Database creation time as well.

Same applies for catalogs as well.
