URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6581
 
 
   Test verifies that delete path exists in ZooKeeper immediately after deleting topic using admin client. But since the actual delete is async, the delete may potentially complete, removing the topic's delete path before the test verifies it. Wait for the topic's paths to be deleted to make the test robust.
