[~amaliujia], thanks for filing this JIRA and working on it.

testOldLeaderNotCommit assumes followers.size() == NUM_SERVERS - 1. For some reasons (the machine is slow?), it was not the true so that it caused IndexOutOfBounds.

We may throw org.junit.AssumptionViolatedException in that case. Then the test will be ignored instead of failing.

I have merged the pull request.  Thanks, [~amaliujia]!
