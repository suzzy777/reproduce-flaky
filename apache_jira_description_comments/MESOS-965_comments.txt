    Fixed flaky test GroupTest.GroupWatchWithSessionExpiration.

    This test became flaky due to a recent change in MESOS-935 that made
    Group update watchers in expired(), this introduced a race condition
    on the 'membership.get().cancelled()' Future (Group thread sets it
    and the test thread reads it).
