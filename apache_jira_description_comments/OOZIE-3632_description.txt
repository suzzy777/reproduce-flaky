Jetty could be upgraded to the latest version, which is now 9.4.28.v20200408, though it has to be checked before if its feasible.

In case we upgrade we have to be aware of wildcard certs with SAN as well and should change the code to use SslContextFactory.server instead of SsslContextFactory in org.apache.oozie.server.SSLServerConnectorFactory class.
