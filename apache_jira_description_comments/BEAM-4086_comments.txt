It hangs with maven too sometimes:

{code:java}
mvn clean verify -Prelease -pl sdks/java/io/kafka
{code}


I've also noticed it hanging with maven intermittently on my machine, so I think  the problem is not with gradle.

Since it seems this isn't Gradle-specific, I'm going to remove this from Gradle migration blockers.

[~rangadi] would you have some time to take a look at this one?

[~aromanenko], I am not able to reproduce it on my Debian desktop. Could you try it and send the stacktrace?

[~iemejia], assigning it to you since it happened frequently in your environment. I am running the build in a loop on my desktop and so far have not been successful in reproducing it. Could you attach jstack of the tests when this happens? Also check if the process is a lot of CPU. 

Sorry [~rangadi] I am leaving it unassigned because I won't be able to check these in the following weeks.

However this issue is not of the 'only in my machine kind'. This has been reported by multiple people. Did you try with gradle ? I could not reproduce it with maven but with gradle it happened at least 1 of each 3 runs.

Nm. I was running gradle. It did finally run into this.

[~rangadi] For me it happened not every time, I'd say 1 out of 4-5.

{{testUnboundedSourceWithoutBoundedWrapper()}} is the test that occasionally hangs. Sent a fix for CPU spinning MockConsumer. As a side effect it seems to avoid this flake. 2400 runs for gradle test runs in sequence passed.

I still don't know the root cause, will keep this bug open.
