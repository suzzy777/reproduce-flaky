currently, when you re-run a workflow job, you have 3 options
 # re-run all of its action nodes
 # re-run failed nodes only
 # re-run with specified nodes skipped

if this workflow job is generated by a coord action. you can re-run this coord action with 2 options
 # re-run all of the workflow action nodes (generate a new workflow job id)
 # re-run failed workflow action nodes only (workflow job id not changed)

now we want to add a another option
 - re-run with specified workflow nodes skipped (workflow job id not changed)
