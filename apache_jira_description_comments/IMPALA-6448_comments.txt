IMPALA-6448: Re-enable kerberized testing with KRPC

For the patch for IMPALA-5054, we realized that we needed to make
the kudu::rpc::Messenger configurable. A patch was done on the Kudu
side which is tracked by KUDU-2228. As part of that patch, one of
the design decisions taken was to only allow kerberos either on or
off for the entirety of the process life. This means that we cannot
switch kerberos on and off in the same process any more with KRPC.
This behavior can be found in SaslInit() in kudu/rpc/sasl_common.cc
as SaslInit() which is called once per process will hard code some
configuration which cannot be toggled.

This affected our kerberized rpc-mgr-tests. This patch splits out
the kerberized part of rpc-mgr-test into rpc-mgr-kerberized-test.

It also puts the common code between both the files into
rpc-mgr-test-base.h

IMPALA-6477: Fix flakiness with thrift-server-test

THe ThriftKerberizedParamsTest.SslConnectivity backend test verifies
that when kerberos and TLS are switched on, we cannot perform a
negotiation with a non TLS enabled client.

The test works as expected, however, the error messages can be
different in some scenarios. This patch just updates the test to
expect a different error message that has the same effect.

This change also links KRB5_REALM_OVERRIDE back with the
rpc-mgr-test, as one test run showed a similar failure as
IMPALA-6268. It's possible that this is due to IMPALA-6448.
