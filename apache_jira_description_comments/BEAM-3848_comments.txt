I am going to work on this. 

There have been discussions recently with [~kirpichov] (BEAM-3820) on whether tuning params should be surfaced. Should this be an option or always on and fully hidden? 

I'll tackle BEAM-3026 which is the sister issue for ElasticSearchIO in the same manner. In that issue it was proposed surfacing it as optional.

Thanks !
