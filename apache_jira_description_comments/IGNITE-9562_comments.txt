The proper solution is moving cache configuration to metastore. There was implemented a workaround to not get the cluster to hang.


We don’t allow nodes with caches which don’t exist in running cluster and the nodes have data on disk.

To allow the nodes join, you need to remove directories with absent caches or start the nodes first.

[~EdShangGG], thanks for your contribution!
Merged to master.

[~ivan.glukos], could you please cherry-pick commit to Ignite 2.7.6 branch once all tests are fixed in master ?https://github.com/apache/ignite/commit/27e9f705c1f65baae20b7dc3c03e988217dbe3f6

according to Eduard comments
     IgniteCacheRestartTestSuite2: IgniteCachePutAllRestartTest.testStopNode   - needs to be researched
PDS 1 [ tests 5 ]       
      IgnitePdsTestSuite: IgnitePdsDestroyCacheTest.testDestroyCachesAbruptly      - can be Ignored/failed because of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-8717

Cache 7 [ tests 2 ]  
      IgniteCacheTestSuite7: CacheMetricsManageTest.testJmxPdsStatisticsEnable - this is an issue, need to be fixed.

Release note: Fixed case when an outdated node with already destroyed cache causes cluster hang

Looks good for me. There are some style issues, but they aren't critical.

[~ivan.glukos] [~mstepachev] thank you for review.

I could merge it to 2.7.6 once TC Bot visa is more or less like N blockers found, where N< 5.

Now there is 9: https://mtcga.gridgain.com/pr.html?serverId=apache&suiteId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll&branchForTc=pull%2F6781%2Fhead&action=Latest&baseBranchForTc=ignite-2.7.6
