TheÂ nameNode.whitelist section in [oozie-default.xml|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/oozie-default.xml] contains the following section:

{noformat}
<property>
        <name>oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.nameNode.whitelist</name>
        <value> </value>
        <description>
            Whitelisted job tracker for Oozie service.
        </description>
    </property>
{noformat}

This is clearly a block-copy error, description is copied from the previous {{jobTracker.whitelist}} section.

We should fix it, maybe it would be useful to check the other description fields in the file as well.
