Based on the oozie-default.xml:
{code:xml}
<property>
    <name>oozie.service.JPAService.retry.maximum-wait-time.ms</name>
    <value>30000</value>
    <description>
          Maximum wait time between database retry attempts.
    </description>
</property>

{code}
it looks like we are missing a "{_}retry{_}" string before the maximum wait time between database retry attempts static string in Oozie's JPAService:
{code:java}
public static final String MAX_WAIT_TIME = CONF_PREFIX + "maximum-wait-time.ms";
{code}
{color:#172b4d}The goal of this change is to sync the config names between oozie-default.xml and Oozie but we should also support the old, invalid config name.{color}
