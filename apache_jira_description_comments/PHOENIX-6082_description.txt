ALTER TABLE/VIEW SET <property> follows the same code path as an add column. Thus, when column-encoding is enabled on the physical table, we will do a checkAndPut with the <physical table schema name>, <physical table name> (see [this|https://github.com/apache/phoenix/blob/4ddbe2688b78645bc73857141cec12cb1c08993b/phoenix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/phoenix/schema/MetaDataClient.java#L3940-L3947]).

This makes sense when we are adding a column since this causes an update to the encoded column qualifier counter of the base table and we want to prevent any concurrent changes to this field. However, when setting properties, we don't update the column qualifier counter so this extra checkAndPut is unnecessary.
