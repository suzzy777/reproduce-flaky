You expect localPeek will return '4' after backup node stop.

I'd think correct way will be
 # to ensure thread that set '4' is the last thread that tries to get a lock. Sleep(1s) doen't give such guarantee.
 # wait for all transactions finished before calling localPeek.Â AFAIK, local peek ignores entry locks and may read stale value.

Sleeps never give you any warranty.

Is it possible to update reproducer?
