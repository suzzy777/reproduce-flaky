kavvya97 opened a new pull request, #6252:
URL: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/6252

   **Setup:**
   Java version: openjdk 11.0.20.1
   Maven version: Apache Maven 3.6.3
   
   ### **Issue**: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-7461
   
   ### Description of PR
   The following tests can fail due to flakiness while comparing the contents of the generated XML response.
   **Module**: hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-app
   `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.webapp.TestAMWebServicesJobs#testJobIdXML`
   `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.webapp.TestAMWebServicesJobs#testJobsXML`
   
   **Module**: hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-hs
   `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.hs.webapp.TestHsWebServicesJobs#testJobIdXML`
   
   
   ### Steps to reproduce
   1. `git clone https://github.com/apache/hadoop`
   2. `mvn install -pl hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-app -am -DskipTests`
   3. Run the tests 
   `mvn -pl hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-app test -Dtests=org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.webapp.TestAMWebServicesJobs#testJobIdXML`
   4. Run the test with the Nondex tool and observe the test results
       `mvn -pl hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-app  edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.webapp.TestAMWebServicesJobs#testJobsIdXML`
        - Test Fails when Running Nondex in ONE mode (Assumes deterministic implementation of code but shuffled once different from underlying implementation) `-DnondexMode=ONE`  & FULL Mode ` -DnondexMode=FULL` (shuffles differently for each call)
        
   ### Root Cause
   The test attempts to send a HTTP GET request to a specific URL and expects a response in XML format. However, XML response order is not necessarily guaranteed. The contents of the XML and the tags are compared with Job contents from `appContext` based on [job Id](https://github.com/kavvya97/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-app/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/v2/app/webapp/TestAMWebServicesJobs.java#L493-L494) in [verifyAMJobXML](https://github.com/kavvya97/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-app/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/v2/app/webapp/TestAMWebServicesJobs.java#L486) / [verifyHsJobXML](https://github.com/kavvya97/hadoop/blob/9c621fcea72a988c930ef614a7c22de00d0c7d21/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-hs/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/v2/hs/webapp/TestHsWebServicesJobs.java#L232).  When comparing the the XML contents,  The `<name>` tag occurs in multiple places inside <job> field. However, the root element within <job> is not always compared due to non-deterministic order.
   When the name tag is being compared, the test utilizes [WebServicesTestUtils.java getXmlString](https://github.com/kavvya97/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/webapp/WebServicesTestUtils.java#L78) method for retrieving the name from the XML content. However, It always takes the first <name> tag irrespective of whether it is nested or in root which causes the test to fail and become flaky.
   
   Since the XML contents are not ordered, The following errors occur
   ```
   [ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 8.377 s <<< FAILURE! - in org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.webapp.TestAMWebServicesJobs
   [ERROR] testJobIdXML(org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.webapp.TestAMWebServicesJobs)  Time elapsed: 8.361 s  <<< FAILURE!
   java.lang.AssertionError:
   [name]
   Expecting:
    "mapreduce.job.acl-view-job"
   to match pattern:
    "RandomWriter"
   ```
   
   ### Fix
   
   Since [WebServicesTestUtils.java getXmlString](https://github.com/kavvya97/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/webapp/WebServicesTestUtils.java#L78) compares the first <name> tag only which might not necessary be the root <name> tag, The Fix uses Xpath to resolve the conflicts by identify the root <name> tag. Thus the test passes since the root tag is always retrieved irrespective of xml order.
   
   ### How was this patch tested?
   The fix was tested by adding a suitable fix and running the Nondex plugin again and ensuring that all the tests pass in FULL Mode and ONE Mode of the Nondex runs.
