Is there any chance you could give it a try and submit a patch since you have a test setup?


I bumped the jackson version to 2.8.6 in the ivy properties on master, then started running Solr tests.  It took three tries, but they finally passed.  The first two runs had entirely different tests fail, so I don't think that it was caused by the change.


Not sure if this matters but when Hadoop updated the Jackson version they stopped at 2.7.8 due to incompatibilities. HADOOP-12705 Not sure if this would affect the HDFS integration? 

Is HDFS integration tested at all in our codebase?

Just double checked there are tests for HDFS integration. If those pass guess its good for me.

Regarding Erick's comment, I did change the Solr dependency of jackson-core from 2.5.4 to 2.6.6 and that resolved my issue. But I'm not sure if it would break any other parts associated with it. I do not even have deep knowledge of the Solr. So would have appreciated your help. And thank you for being active on this!

[~markrmiller@gmail.com][~mdrob@cloudera.com] Do you have any comments?


+1 to upgrade versions - Jackson has been much better about documenting their back compat issues recently than they were in the days of 1.x
Looking over the list, there shouldn't be anything that affects us. Hadoop stopping at 2.7.x is surprising to me, but it looks like they are planning on jackson 2.8.x in hadoop 3 (which will happen may or may not happen in our lifetimes).

While I'd generally suggest using the last patch release of the minimum supported version we need to get things working (2.6.7) for client compat reasons, the security fixes in only present in 2.7.x+ push me towards that instead.

tl;dr: I trust Jackson to be largely compatible across the board, and where possible we should not hold ourselves to Hadoop's "latest and greatest of 2005" philosophy.

[~elyograg] - Are you planning to post a patch/commit the bump of jackson?

Patch against master.  Precommit passes on Linux.

Realized that I was running tests as root, which makes some of them fail.  Trying again as a regular user.

Tests passed as soon as I stopped using root. :)

Hi,

Thank you for working on this issue. Can someone comment on when this change can be visible in a release approximately.

Thanks,
Shashank

[~elyograg] - the change looks reasonable to me. planning to commit?

[~spedamallu] - If this gets committed, it would be in the next minor release of 6.x. That is 6.5 as of right now. 

bq. Realized that I was running tests as root, which makes some of them fail. Trying again as a regular user.
[~elyograg] - already filed as SOLR-10027 :)

There's now a fully shaded AWS JAR, jackson included. See HADOOP-14040.

At 50 MB it's big, and has been causing some problems simply due to classloader overhead and distribution, hence we aren't (currently) backporting in Hadoop. But it stops your choice of jackson being dictated by the S3 integration.

I wanted to provide a bit of testing information on this issue:

 

I replaced jackson core/databind/annotations 2.5.4 with version 2.9.5. I did NOT replace jackson-dataformat-smile 2.5.4 at this point. Just FYI, this jar has since been deprecated and is now part of the jackson-dataformat-binary module.

After replacing these .jars I was able to start Solr, create a new core, create a new collection, alter the schema, index and query json. I have noted no errors.

 

 

I can agree with the notion that Solr should stay current on its dependencies whenever that is possible.  But something occurred to me while thinking about this:

Solr is intended to be a completely self-contained service.  The version of any dependency that Solr includes (such as Jackson) should not matter to any other software on the system.  Normally other software will be entirely separate from Solr.


Kevin pointed me to [this|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?adv_search=true&cpe=cpe%3a%2fa%3afasterxml%3ajackson-databind%3a2.5.4] offline which is a list of CVEs for jackson . So we should upgrade jackson . On the other hand if we can move it's usage to noggit or something then we reduce another dependency . I'll start investigating tomorrow

Here's my analysis:
- We can't remove jackson. Calcite/hadoop and probably a few other projects needs it as a dependency. Currently within Solr a few contribs use jackson-core directly.
- Current Hadoop version: 2.7.4
- hadoop-common and hadoop-hdfs ( 2.7.4 ) explicitly have jackson 1.9.13 as a dependency
- Solr currently uses Jackson 2.5.4 and the latest Jackson version is 2.9.5
- Didn't run into any issues while running "ant test" and "ant -Dtests.nightly=true "-Dtests.class=org.apache.solr.cloud.hdfs.*"" ( one test was hung but that's probably the test being flaky. Didn't have any class not found issues )

 

[~elyograg] I think we should just commit this? 

Let's get it upgraded!   I think going to the latest is better than a step to an intermediate version.  It looked like the patch goes to 2.8.6.

Hi Shawn,

Do you want to commit this . Otherwise happy to pick it up and wrap it up
