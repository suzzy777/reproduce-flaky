I found out that when I run these tests successfully locally there are no ScheduledChore in the logs.
When the precommit job runs these test there are ScheduledChores and the tests are failing.

I have added some sleeps to the HivePhoenixStoreIT to have enough time for the ScheduledChores to run and then the tests failed locally as well.
Then edited DEFAULT_INITIAL_DELAY in ChoreServicer and made it around 40 mins, it was way over the test execution time so there was no ScheduledChore ran, the tests ran again successfully.

I am going to continue work on this issue and try found out the faulty chore, but wanted to make some notes.

I have some information that could be useful later.
{code:java}
***** ABORTING region server{code}
After 10 Failed flushing store file region server was aborted.
{code:java}
[MemStoreFlusher.1] HStore - Failed flushing store file, retrying num={code}
MemStoreFlusher could not store file because there wasn't any node available to write to.
{code:java}
NetworkTopology - Choosing random from 0 available nodes
NetworkTopology - chooseRandom returning null
NetworkTopology - No node to choose.{code}
All that remains is to find out why. Possibly a wrong configuration of the mini clusters?

 

Thanks for hunting down the cause. 

I'll have a go at fixing it.
