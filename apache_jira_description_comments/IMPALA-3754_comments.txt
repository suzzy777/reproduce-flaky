Have we seen this anywhere other than repeated_runs? It seems strange that this would be non-deterministic.

I havent seen it anywhere else yet. I'll post an update if it come up.


IMPALA-3754: fix TestParquet.test_corrupt_rle_counts flakiness

The test could hit one of two similar errors, depending on which order
it read the files. This patch fixes the ERROR/CATCH blocks to be more
permissive, so that either error is accepted.
