Based on the discussion (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23757), I cherry-picked the three commits in branch-2.3: https://github.com/apache/spark/compare/02e989057fbf110b9048788a578c2620cb94a7ca...55d5a19c8e01de945c4c9e42752ed132df4b9110

I'll keep watching the Jenkins tests in branch-2.3 for a couple of days, and if the flaky tests gone, I'll close this.

I closed this cuz it seems these test failures don't happen in the recent branch-2.3 test runs.

Thanks [~kabhwan]!
