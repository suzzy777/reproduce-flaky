Dtest cdc_test::TestCDC::test_insertion_and_commitlog_behavior_after_reaching_cdc_total_space always fails on an assertion.

the assert is the final step of the test and it checks that pre_non_cdc_write_cdc_raw_segments == _get_cdc_raw_files(node.get_path())

This fails 100% of the time locally, 100% of the time on circleci executed under pytest, and 100% of the time for the past 40 test runs on ASF Jenkins runs against trunk.

This is the only test failure (excluding flaky one-off failures) remaining on the pytest dtest branch. I'm going to annotate the test with a skip marker (including a reason reference to this JIRA)... when it's fixed we should also remove the skip annotation from the test.
