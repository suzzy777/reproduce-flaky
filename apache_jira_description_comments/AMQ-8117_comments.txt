Let me take a look (to qualify). If a fix is needed (it could be just a documentation concern), I'm not sure I will have time to integrate for 5.16.1/5.15.15.

[~coheigea] found an existing issue on this.

its reproducible in all versions 5.15.13->5.16.2 and leaves the VirtualSelectorCacheBrokerPlugin unable to read the cache it wrote.

steps to reproduce:

do a clean install.

enable the plugin VirtualSelectorCacheBrokerPlugin

start activemq

stop activemq - cache have now been written.

start active mq and observe exception.

It seems related to the security enforcement we added.

 ConcurrentHashMap does write a Segments array once serialized and so getName would be  [Ljava.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap$Segment;

my own quickfix i guess can just be to add

|| desc.getName().startsWith("[Ljava.util.")

 

but i wonder how come this is there in the first place and not just depending on what can be done via jdk.serialFilter as understand it was backported to java 6,7,8 and is pretty much the same or is the reason you have to support older jvm's ?
