Often enough, folks miss-judge split points or otherwise end up with a suboptimal number of regions. We should have an automated, reliable way to "reshape" or "balance" a table's region boundaries. This would be for tables that contain existing data. This might look like:

{noformat}
Admin#reshapeTable(TableName, int numSplits);
{noformat}

or from the shell:

{noformat}
> reshape TABLE, numSplits
{noformat}

Better still would be to have a maintenance process, similar to the existing Balancer that runs AssignmentManager on an interval, to run the above "reshape" operation on an interval. That way, the cluster will automatically self-correct toward a desirable state.
