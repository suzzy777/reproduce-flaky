[~schernolyas], thank you for your efforts! I looked into [PR|https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/7347/] and I have some questions:
# Can we use {{org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractBeanFactory#getBeanExpressionResolver}} for an expression evaluation? Generally it sounds good to have a behavior consistent with {{@Value}} annotation.
# I suppose the next question was discussed somehow but it would good to reflect it in the ticket. Why do we reuse old {{@RepositoryConfig}} annotation enhancing it with new capabilities? Theoretically it can lead to backward incompatibility. Other options here are adding a new annotation and deprecating the old one or adding a new property to the existing annotation.

Hi [~Pavlukhin] !

1) I don't know. It need to be checked.  In theory, I am doing the same.

2) The way was proposed. To extend feature of field "cacheName" of @RepositoryConfig.  You right that is can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is logical.  On the other hand, it can be source of errors and misunderstandings

Could you please review the PR [https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/7381] ?

LGTM, Please add the visa. [~irakov] Please merge it after the visa.

[~schernolyas], [~mstepachev], it looks like that new test classes were not added to any test suite. All tests must be added to a test suite in order to run them in CI. I suppose Maksim can help to choose a proper suite.

Maksim, please do a code review carefully.

Hi [~Pavlukhin]!

The tests have been appended to corresponding test suits. 

Can I change status of the issue  ?

[~schernolyas], according to the development process a ticket can be moved to _patch available_ status as long as a PR is ready from standpoint of an author and there is a TC bot visa. But here I suppose we should rerun test suites where tests were added as a visa added previously does not have new tests executed.

New PR is created. See [https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/7411]
