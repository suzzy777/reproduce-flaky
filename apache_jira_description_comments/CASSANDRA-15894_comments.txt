I've been trying to repro again on dtest f6b79abec6f059add754d5cceaab1009089c962b and C* e563012cbd118c34a7e16e6f12968bcdae9542b8 with no luck. I did run the test a few times locally as well. I am going to close these 3 you raised as cannot repro, but feel free to slap me in the hands and reopen them if you manage to repro. I'll be happy to help :)

 

Edit: Actually, I'll leave them to you to 'review', sort to speak, so we both agree on closing them.

I think REPAIR was improved recently as I think I saw some related tickets closed. Now I managed to run this test successfully 100 times on the latest trunk. (when I opened this ticket, It was consistently failing on my computer).

But I observed in the log (Attached to this ticket) that from time to time the test succeeds only after second run. The first time it times out again.

[~blerer] , as the one assigned to apply expertise to CASSANDRA-15580, what is your advice, should we check further this ticket/particular test at this moment? Thank you in advance :)

PS I just tried to find out the reasoning behind the setup of running the test two times before it is considered failed. Unfortunately, back in time these tests were moved from a different script to incremental_repair_test.py and at that point some of the git historical data is lost as the old script was deleted.

 

My guess is that some tests were border line in term of duration and that the team in charge of the tests at that time discovered that if you run them twice you reduce the number of failures (the dtest project had different owners over time).
For that test I would simply try to see if we can increase reasonably the timeout at the point of failure.

Thank you for your clarification [~blerer] .

I figured it out from the logs that it is a driver, client connection time out. I am tempted not to touch it for now while it is stable enough, wdyt?

I believe that it is ok to ignore it for now. If the problem start showing up more often we will have to figure out some better timeout.


Thank you! Closing

Just saw this again here: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/maedhroz/cassandra/445/workflows/c6e0a7e7-7efa-4776-b668-edb8adc0f759/jobs/3933
