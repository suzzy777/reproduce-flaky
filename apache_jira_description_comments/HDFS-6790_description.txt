As part of HADOOP-10904, DFSUtil should be changed to leverage the new method on Configuration for acquiring known passwords for SSL. The getPassword method will leverage the credential provider API and/or fallback to the clear text value stored in ssl-server.xml.

This will provide an alternative to clear text passwords on disk while maintaining backward compatibility for this behavior.
