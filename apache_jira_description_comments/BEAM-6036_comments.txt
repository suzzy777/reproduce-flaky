This is a good question for StackOverflow. You have windowed into GlobalWindows, so all the KVs are in the same window. That is why they are all being returned as part of the View.asMap() side input.

[~kenn] Thank you, I'll post a question on Stack Overflow. 

From your comment it follows that the solution described in the article is not supposed to work, because it uses GlobalWindows.

For the second part of the question, I'm going to create a minimal project demonstrating the flaky tests issue.

This should fix things https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6261
