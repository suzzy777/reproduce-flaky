Tried increasing fixed_window_duration to 20, no more errors.

I talked to Boyuan offline. t seems fixed_window_duration in [20,60] works, but fixed_window_duration=1 complained.

Hi all, what's the plan for this issue? Is it a 2.6.0 blocker?

We would not have time to address this for 2.6.0. We could also reduce this to a minor issues since it is a DirectRunner only issue. Please change the fix version once the new version is available in JIRA.

FYI: I hit this issue when running run_rc_validation.sh for Beam 2.9.0 RC1 (for DirectRunner). Looks like this has not been addressed yet. So I'll ignore this. [~boyuanz] can you confirm that this is a known issue of run_rc_validation.sh script that you wrote ? 

https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/release/src/main/scripts/run_rc_validation.sh

I don't think it's an issue with my script. This should be an issue within python SDK. fixed_window_duration=20 used to work before 2.9.0.

Yes. Seems like this has regressed for 2.9.0.

 

Raising to blockers status.

 

Charles, are you aware of an update related to combiner for DirectRunner that can result in a regression ?

Spoke with Charles and Ahmet about this. Seems like this test is flaky and this is a known issue.

 

So setting fix version to 2.10.0

Do we know more about this? If it is a flake, I am going to alter its priority and tagging.

I do not believe this is a flake. This is a an issue with the DirectRunner's handling of streaming side inputs. It never really worked. We do not need to block the release on this issue.

I guess it is a flaky bug rather than a flaky test? I put it on 2.11.0 to make sure it gets another round of attention.

I am guessing that this is obsolete. Is that right? Can it be closed?

Closed. Most likely obsolete. Or will be obsolete after the change to fnapi direct runner.
