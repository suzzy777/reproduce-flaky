    Added tests to ensure that tasks can access their parent's volumes.

    These tests verify that sibling tasks can share a persistent volume
    owned by their parent executor using 'sandbox_path' volumes.

    Added a test that uses environment secrets and the DefaultExecutor.

    This test checks that environment secrets are properly resolved and
    exposed to tasks started by the DefaultExecutor.

    Improved `NvidiaGpuTest.ROOT_CGROUPS_NVIDIA_GPU_VerifyDeviceAccess`.

    Change the test so that the agent offesr as many GPUs as available on
    the box instead of restricting it to 1. This way the test will fail if
    there's a bug that makes the isolator give a task access to more GPUs
    than what it was allocated.

I have a patch with the URI tests, but they're flaky because of MESOS-7927.

Cleaned up DefaultExecutor tests.

Updated the DefaultExecutor tests to use test helpers where possible.
Also made the boilerplate initialization code consistent across tests.

    Added a test using Docker, a file URI, and the DefaultExecutor.

    This test verifies that URIs set on Docker tasks are fetched and made
    available to them when started by the DefaultExecutor.

    Added a test using DefaultExecutor + health check + persistent volume.
    
    This test verifies that the command health checks initiated by the
    default executor are able to read files in a persistent volume.
