{{testRateThrottling}} verifies that bootstrap transfer should timeout with a very small {{DFS_IMAGE_TRANSFER_BOOTSTRAP_STANDBY_RATE_KEY}} value. However, throttling on the image sender only happens after sending each IO buffer. Therefore, the test sometimes fails if the receiver receives the full fsimage (which is smaller than IO buffer size) before throttling begins.
