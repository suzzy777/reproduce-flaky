Flaky test dashboard shows following assert quite frequently:
{noformat}
/data1/jenkins-workspace/kudu-workspace/src/kudu/tools/kudu-tool-test.cc:1203: Failure
Value of: tombstoned_opid.index()
  Actual: 205
Expected: last_logged_opid.index()
Which is: 206
{noformat}

It is not clear whether this is a test bug or if this is catching a genuine bug, for now labeling this with test component.
