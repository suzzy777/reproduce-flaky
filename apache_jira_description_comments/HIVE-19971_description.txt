This test is timing dependent and sometimes fails. [You can see that it sometimes fails in otherwise clean runs|https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=text%20~%20%22TestRuntimeStats%22].  The test inserts a stat, sleeps for 2 seconds, inserts another stat, then deletes stats that are older than 1 second. The test asserts that exactly one stat is deleted. If the deletion is slow for some reason (perhaps a GC?) then 2 stats will be deleted and the test will fail. The trouble is that the 1 second window is too small to work consistently.
