The root cause of the failure

Check:
{code}
    runAcidMetricService();
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long oldDiff = (now - oldStart)/1000;
    long youngDiff = (now - youngStart)/1000;

    long threshold = 1000;
    int intValue = Metrics.getOrCreateGauge(MetricsConstants.OLDEST_READY_FOR_CLEANING_AGE).intValue();
    System.err.println("Now: " + now);
    System.err.println("Old start: " + oldStart);
    System.err.println("Young start: " + youngStart);
    System.err.println("Old diff: " + oldDiff);
    System.err.println("Young diff: " + youngDiff);
    System.err.println("Age: " + intValue);

    boolean assertValue = (intValue <= (oldDiff + threshold));
    Assert.assertTrue(assertValue);
{code}

Output
{code}
Now: 1638863282765
Old start: 1638863245187
Young start: 1638863263762
Old diff: 37 (diff 37578)
Young diff: 19 (19003)
Age: 18 (which is calculated and rounded inside the runAcidMetricsService)
{code}

The problem is about rounding the current time to seconds in different systems.
- Test -> System.currentTimeInMillies()
- Db metric -> NOW() / 1000
The above two instants might have differences in time.

Committed to master branch. Thanks for your contribution [~vcsomor]
