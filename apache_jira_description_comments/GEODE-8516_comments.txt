   The commands that are allowed in the context of a subscribed client are SUBSCRIBE, PSUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, PUNSUBSCRIBE, PING and QUIT.
   
   Tests were added for these commands.  We also discovered that we were not throwing the proper error if we tried to do commands that were not supported while subscribed.  We corrected this issue.  The test for PING while subscribed was ignored because it is a different issue (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-8515).
