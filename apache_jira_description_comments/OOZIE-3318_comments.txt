The problems addressed by the [^OOZIE-3318.001.patch] are the following ones:
 * duplicated result for JAVADOC removed
 * The color of warnings from the current HEAD changed to orange
 * False Error check result removed

The logic from the actual check is the following:
 * check if Javadoc generation succeeded.
 ** If no, report -1 for JAVADOC. In this case the warning check will be skipped, because it may lead to false results
 ** If yes, check for warnings
 *** print the already existing Javadoc warnings 
 *** if new Javadoc warnings were introduced, report -1 for JAVADOC
 *** if no, report +1 for JAVADOC

Thanks for the contribution [~kmarton]! Great work on the output formatting in different cases :)

Can you please:
* check why Javadoc generation fails currently
* please elaborate on mixed Javadoc errors / warnings scenarios as well

It failed because of dependency issues. It failed on pre-patch as well.

{noformat}
Locally this kind of issue didn't`t occurred, so I will upload another patch with the fix.

 

[~andras.piros], related the mixed cases: If there are Javadoc errors, the Javadoc generation will fail, so in this case the warnings will be ignored, since a warning check can lead to false results.

I have addressed the dependency in [^OOZIE-3318.002.patch].  

I have added a clean package before calling javadoc:javadoc. This way, if there is a build failure due to some other issues than Javadoc error, JAVADOC will still report -1, but in this case, most probably the COMPILE task will fail as well, unless the failure will *not* occur until test goal, and will occur when executing the package goal.

Still not good. the pre-patch Javadoc generation failed. 

The pre-patch is failing because for this phase, the original script is used, and is causing failure because of dependency issues. In the script I have fixed it both in pre and post part as well, and I expect it to work fine after the changeset integration.

In the last patch I have addressed some ShellCheck issues.

Thanks [~kmarton] for the patch. Would it be possible to simplify the warning number calculation? Using a single grep instead of the grep+awk combo? Something like that:
{noformat}
grep -c '\[WARNING\].*warning' ./test-patch/reports/JAVADOC-clean.txt{noformat}

thank you [~asalamon74] for the review! I have updated the warning number calculation with your suggestion.

Thanks for the contribution [~kmarton]!

Can you please:
* substitute the {{grep | awk}} combo w/ {{grep -c}} as per [~asalamon74]'s suggestion
* post sample {{JAVADOC}} outputs for all paths while injecting Javadoc faults on demand into Oozie source

[~andras.piros] Based on my suggestion [~kmarton] already simplified the grep + awk combo and eliminated one of the awk calls. The other awk is necessary to avoid counting non-javadoc related warnings.

[~andras.piros], I've already posted possible outputs: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE-3318?focusedCommentId=16570061&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16570061

 

[~kmarton] my bad, that comment slipped my eyes :) +1

Committed to {{master}}.

Closing issue; Oozie 5.1.0 is released.
