Pulsar mail queue bringed in some unstable tests


{code:java}
Test Result (4 failures / +4)

    org.apache.james.queue.pulsar.PulsarMailQueueTest.removeByRecipientShouldRemoveSpecificEmail
    org.apache.james.queue.pulsar.PulsarMailQueueTest.removeByRecipientShouldRemoveSpecificEmailWhenMultipleRecipients{List, MailAddress}[5]
    org.apache.james.queue.pulsar.PulsarMailQueueTest.removeByRecipientShouldRemoveSpecificEmailWhenMultipleRecipients{List, MailAddress}[6]
    org.apache.james.queue.pulsar.PulsarMailQueueTest.removeShouldRemoveMailFromStoreWhenFilteredOut
{code}

Looking at the first, some email expected to be deleted were not:

{code:java}
Error Message

Expecting actual:
  ["name1", "name2"]
to contain exactly (and in same order):
  ["name1"]
but some elements were not expected:
  ["name2"]
{code}

Maybe because propagation of the delete filter is asynchronous? (IE the client delete returns when enqueuing the filter but without any warranty so as when it would be dequeued and applied). If so this isa design flaw and I hardly see how to improve that .

Or we add a delay in the tests to relax the consistency guaranty?
