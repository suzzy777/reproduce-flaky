Some precommit jobs have been hitting intermittent test failures on DataCacheTest.SetReadOnly:
{noformat}
/home/ubuntu/Impala/be/src/runtime/io/data-cache-test.cc:165
Expected: (cache_misses) > (0), actual: 0 vs 0{noformat}
The test has a race condition that means it can't guarantee that the cache_misses is strictly greater than zero.
