SqlQuery has been deprecated in favor of SqlFieldsQuery, but ContinuousQuery in Ignite.NET does not allow SqlFieldsQuery as InitialQuery. 

Java API allows that, so we have to derive SqlFieldsQuery from QueryBase and make it work.
The problem will arise when SqlFieldsQuery does not return _key & _val - see how Java handles this.
