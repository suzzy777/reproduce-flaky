This issue does not affect the 0.12.x tag but does affect master.  I am running the Oracle JDK 1.7 and seeing this issue.  I tried to fix it by adding -Djava.awt.headless=true and -noawt to the run/test scripts but neither solved the issue.  Would be happy to test a fix.

Hey Brian, I fixed this for me by adding -Djava.awt.headless=true to the JVM args.
Note that we create an embedded JVM so this had to be done in jvm.cpp.

Can you confirm this patch fixes the issue for you?
