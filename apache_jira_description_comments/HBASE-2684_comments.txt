    This looks wrong.  Shouldn't the index be '1' for the second server?  Its the index you used at start of the test to get reference to seconServer.
    
    Otherwise, looks good.. go ahead and commit

After chatting with Stack and looking at the code, it appears I'm actually doing the right thing (he had another method in mind that did not remove the region server from the list).
