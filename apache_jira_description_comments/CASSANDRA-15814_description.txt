By creating a table like the following:
{code:java}
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS software (
 name ascii,
 version frozen<list<int>>,
 data ascii,
 PRIMARY KEY(name,version)
)
{code}
It works and version is ordered in an ascending order. But when trying to order in descending order:
{code:java}
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS software (
    name ascii,
    version frozen<list<int>>,
    data ascii,
    PRIMARY KEY(name,version)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (version DESC);
{code}
The table is created normally, but when trying to insert a row:
{code:java}
insert into software(name, version) values ('t1', [2,10,30,40,50]); 
{code}
Cassandra throws an error:
{code:java}
InvalidRequest: Error from server: code=2200 [Invalid query] message="Invalid list literal for version of type frozen<list<int>>"
{code}
The goal here is that I would like to get the last version of a software.
