Is there a ZooKeeper ticket related to this?

I didn't find one.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2049

https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/19.patch would be an upstream patch suggestion. I know this is kind of a red flag but given that Yosemite's release is close, should we also go ahead and include a hotfix patch within our bundle?

Awesome job following up with a patch [~tillt]!

I would try to find out when your patch would be part of the next release.
Likely we'll need a .patch in the interim, but let's wait to see your patch land in ZooKeeper first so that we know it's the right approach?

[~bmahler] +1

Hoping their unit tests are actually just flaky as my patch got flagged by them (just like many others that still got committed).

[~xujyan] Would you be available for shepparding https://reviews.apache.org/r/26571 which should fix the above issue?
Note however that we still intend to wait for upstream to commit this patch into their project - hence the above RR would be a hotfix to prevent us from having to upgrade the bundled ZooKeeper altogether.

Sure. +1 for waiting for ZOOKEEPER-2049 given that it's shepherded there as well. (Looks like it is and it's making good progress)

https://reviews.apache.org/r/26571 ready for review.

commit 64862a70cca7b8531ef5421db649d151533fd0ae
Author: Till Toenshoff <toenshoff@me.com>

    Fixed ZooKeeper 3.4.5 OSX Yosemite build.
    
    Fixes build issue caused by htonll introduced by OSX 10.10 (Yosemite).
    
    This poses as a hotfix to prevent us from having to upgrade the bundled
    ZooKeeper altogether to prevent longer regression testing. Once
    ZooKeeper does get updated into a recent version (3.4.x >= 3.4.7,
    3.5.x >= 3.5.1 or >= 3.6.0), this patch should get removed.

What is the fix version? I still see issues on 0.21.0:
https://gist.github.com/bmahler/71822e25fcb195d8df4b

Looks like the .patch file was not included in the Makefile?

Re-opening because the .patch file is not included in the distribution.

Marked for 0.21.0. Fix here:

    Does this comment still apply? AFAICT MESOS-1797 doesn't apply to ZK 3.4.8 since that issue has been resolved in ZK 3.4.7. Looks all the patch does is apply PPC specific fixes for which you already submitted a review https://reviews.apache.org/r/45376/.
    
    I would recommend to kill the zookeper.patch stuff in this review altogether since 3.4.8 doesn't need any patches per se. Then in https://reviews.apache.org/r/45376/ you can add back the patch stuff and mention that you need the patch to compile it on PPC.

    Thank your for pointing this, I will remove this comment. And for the zookeeper patch file I think I already removed it.
