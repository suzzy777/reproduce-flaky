ping: is there any blocker for integrating the patch?

I'd really like to avoid the next Oozie releases (4.3.x and 5.x) to come without this much improved rendering

(and waiting for this simple change to be merged before trying to work on more complex OOZIE-3164)

[~hboutemy] I've generated the docs using the patch, looks OK to me. +1

Committed to {{master}}. The actual cherry-pick to {{branch-4.3}} I leave up to [~gezapeti]'s decision, he's the release manager for {{4.3.1}}.

I don't think I'll create a new RC to include this patch only, but f there is a need for a new RC for 4.3.1 I'll still try to generate the docs for 4.3.1 using the fluido skin and check whit other PMC members if that's ok

Wow!  That looks so much better.  Thanks for taking care of this.

I'm glad you like it: as a Maven PMC member, previous rendering just made me not feel proud of Maven itself :)

[~rkanter], is it ok to use the new skin for 4.3.1 without creating a new RC?

Hmmm, it would be okay with me, but I think technically we would need a new RC because of the tagging, md5, etc.  Let's leave the RC as-is (so the release will have the old docs), but we can put the new skin on the 4.3.1 docs on the Oozie website.  I imagine most users look at the docs there anyway, rather than on the copy in the Oozie Server.

The 4.3.1 documentation looks way nicer :)

Thanks [~hboutemy]!

Closing issue; Oozie 5.0.0 is released.
