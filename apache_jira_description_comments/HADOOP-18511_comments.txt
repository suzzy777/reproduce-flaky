   ### Description of PR
   This PR aims to solve the issue here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18511
   
   The fix is to sort the properties returned by getAttribute() so that the non-deterministic behavior can be eliminated completely. In this way, the test becomes more stable and it will not suffer from failure anymore.
   
   ### How was this patch tested?
   Execute `mvn test` locally on vm with environment:
   ```
   Apache Maven 3.6.0;
   openjdk version "1.8.0_342";
   OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_342-8u342-b07-0ubuntu1~20.04-b07);
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.342-b07, mixed mode);
   ```
   ### For code changes:
   
   - [x] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'HADOOP-18511. Your PR title ...')?
   - [ ] Object storage: have the integration tests been executed and the endpoint declared according to the connector-specific documentation?
   - [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?
   - [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE`, `LICENSE-binary`, `NOTICE-binary` files?

   The regression test of hadoop-common found no problems, why does the sorting lead to instability?

   We are working on a project [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) to find out flaky tests in open-source projects and help developers to fix them.
   
   Using Nondex to detect potential flaky tests can find tests that might fail with different versions of JAVA. For example, the implementation of `HashSet` is such that iterating through the elements returns them in a deterministic order for **one Java
   version**, but that order can change between Java versions. Therefore, fixing flaky tests is important for making the program more compatible with different versions of programming languages.
   
   And I found that Hadoop has accepted PR https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/1835 for fixing flaky tests detected by NonDex. Therefore, I assumed that you might be interested in fixing further flaky tests to make tests more robust.
   
   Please feel free to ask me any questions about the flaky test! We are working on it. And hope this PR can be considered accepted!
