That is pure debug that should not have made it into code base. Thanks for surfacing it [~meszibalu]

Both of these lines can go:

    LOG.info("ASKED IF SPLITTABLE " + result + " " + getRegionInfo().getShortNameToLog(),
      new Throwable("LOGGING: REMOVE"));
    // REMOVE BELOW!!!!
    LOG.info("DEBUG LIST ALL FILES");

The fix is not complicated, so I verify the patch locally. There are two failed tests. Retrying the {{{{TestMasterFailoverWithProcedur}}}} is succeed. {{TestCompactionInDeadRegionServer}} is flaky test. The patch is ready to be committed Iâ€™d like to say. [~stack] any suggestion?

I agree w/ you [~chia7712]  Added you as sign-off on the patch. Pushed to master and branch-2.
