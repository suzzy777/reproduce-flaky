You have a patch [~jonathan.lawlor]? Thanks boss.

The patch adds the MovedRegionsCleaner chore to the background chores. Also added a unit test to test this.


Can we have it so we don't have test wait for 240 seconds for test to complete?  How about setting down the timers for when this task runs to a few seconds?  Fix formatting in test too so it is like other tests (two spaces for tab).  Otherwise, nice patch.  Thanks.

Thanks for fixing this one [~asameet], some review on patch below:
- Because the chore is started outside of MovedRegionsCleaner#createAndStart it may be best to rename the method to simply MovedRegionsCleaner#create
- As [~stack] pointed out, there are some formatting issues in the test class. If you're developing in eclipse there is a formatter (dev-support/hbase_eclipse_formatter.xml) that will do all the formatting for you every time you save
- May want to get the timeout value used for this chore in a method that can be overriden for tests

Otherwise looks good, thanks for the patch

Thanks stack. Jonathan. Changed based on your feedback

We might want to use Waiter.waitFor rather than sleeping. Jenkins and other CI builds get a little flaky when using a sleep.

Replaced Thread.Sleep with a waitFor

Patch looks nice. I don't think this will cause any issues but going submit patch to trigger QA; see what it thinks.

Looks like it ran into the flaky test TestAcidGuarantees, looks unrelated. We can retry the QA build to be sure. 

The checkstyle error is coming from an unused import in HRegionServer.java (there also seem to be some ununsed imports inside TestMovedRegionsCleaner that could be removed). The checkstyle also recommends we declare MovedRegionsCleaner as a final class.

Cleanup checkstyle errors

Patch looks great, Thanks [~asameet]. 

Do you think test failure is related? It passes for me when run locally and has been seen failing in other recent precommit builds so probably just flaky.

The test is unrelated. It passes locally on my machine as well. 

Great; [~stack] I think this one is ready to go in, thoughts?

+1 from me. I'll commit unless there are any objections


Pushed to branch-1 and master.
Since this is a cosmetic only chore I wasn't sure about backporting it any farther.

Thanks for the patch [~asameet]

Looking

This doesn't reproduce standalone for me.  Jonathan Lawlor also saw this on the pre-commit. Is someone able to reproduce this consistently?

Closing issues released in 1.1.0.
