This would require a cherry pick for 2.38.0 in order to prevent wrong autoscaling behaviour if using the SpannerIO.readChangeStreams() functionality.

Currently, the implementation is under-reporting the backlog estimation, which would most likely produce scale down events even when there is enough work for the current number of workers.

By adding the check here, we prevent surprising production behavior when using the Connector.

(I'm copy-pasting my comment from the other release-blocker because it is completely applicable here)

I can fit this cherry-pick in since it's all ready and won't delay the release.

While it technically doesn't fit the requirements for a release-blocker (since it isn't a "significant regression or loss of functionality"), it's in a weird spot due to being a new feature. So sure, technically none of this can be a regression since it's all a new feature of this release. But this is still a known issue with noticeable user impact and the cherry-pick isn't delaying anything, so I think it's worth getting in.
