Originally suggested in [GitHub PR #386|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/386], the CMake build I wrote used {{include_directories}}, which has global side effects, instead of the more explicit {{target_include_directories}}, to include directories per target (and with private or public scoping).

Furthermore, it should also use {{CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}} over {{CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}} in order to allow inclusion in other projects via {{add_subdirectory()}}, and we can reduce the minimally required CMake version to 3.5 from 3.6.
