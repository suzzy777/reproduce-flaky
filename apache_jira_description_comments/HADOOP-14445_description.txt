As discovered in HADOOP-14441, KMS HA using LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider do not share delegation tokens. (a client uses KMS address/port as the key for delegation token)
{code:title=DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL#openConnection}
if (!creds.getAllTokens().isEmpty()) {
        InetSocketAddress serviceAddr = new InetSocketAddress(url.getHost(),
            url.getPort());
        Text service = SecurityUtil.buildTokenService(serviceAddr);
        dToken = creds.getToken(service);
{code}
But KMS doc states:

Delegation Tokens

Similar to HTTP authentication, KMS uses Hadoop Authentication for delegation tokens too.

Under HA, A KMS instance must verify the delegation token given by another KMS instance, by checking the shared secret used to sign the delegation token. To do this, all KMS instances must be able to retrieve the shared secret from ZooKeeper.

We should either update the KMS documentation, or fix this code to share delegation tokens.
