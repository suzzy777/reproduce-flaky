The _at_least_once_ version of the "{*}EosIntegrationTest.shouldWriteLatestOffsetsToCheckpointOnShutdown"{*} test is occasionally failing with
h3. Error Message

java.lang.AssertionError: The committed records do not match what expected Expected: <[KeyValue(0, 0), KeyValue(0, 1), KeyValue(0, 3), KeyValue(0, 6), KeyValue(0, 10), KeyValue(0, 15), KeyValue(0, 21), KeyValue(0, 28), KeyValue(0, 36), KeyValue(0, 45)]> but: was <[KeyValue(0, 0), KeyValue(0, 1), KeyValue(0, 3), KeyValue(0, 6), KeyValue(0, 10), KeyValue(0, 10), KeyValue(0, 11), KeyValue(0, 13), KeyValue(0, 16), KeyValue(0, 20), KeyValue(0, 25), KeyValue(0, 31), KeyValue(0, 38)]>

 

Seems we are receiving more than the expected records.

...of course, this is an ALOS flavor of the {*}EOS{*}IntegrationTest, so perhaps we shouldn't be running this variant at all? Not sure if this explains the exact output we receive but it certainly seems suspicious
