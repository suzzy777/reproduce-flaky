With the Implementation of IMPALA-11822, We can skip some of the events by comparing the current event's id with the latestRefreshEventId of that table/partition.Â

IMPALA-11535: Skip older events in the event processor based on the
latestRefreshEventID

Summary: If the table has been manually refreshed, all its events
happen before the manual REFRESH can be skipped. This happens when
catalogd is lagging behind in processing events. When processing an
event, we can check whether there are manual REFRESH executed after
its eventTime. In such case, we don't need to process the event to
refresh anything. This helps catalogd to catch up HMS events quickly.

Implementation details: Updated the lastRefreshEventId on the table or
partition whenever there is table or partition level refresh/load.
By comparing the lastRefreshEventId to current event id in the event
processor the older events can be skipped.

set enable_skipping_older_events to true to enable this optimization

Testing:
- Unit end-to-end test and unit test to test the functionality.

IMPALA-12416: Fix test failures caused by
IMPALA-11535

Fixed the test failures in Java unit tests caused by incorrectly
setting the config 'enable_sync_to_latest_event_on_ddls' to true. This
flag has to be reset to its original value at the end of the test since
BackendConfig.INSTANCE is shared by all the FE tests. Also, increased
the hms polling interval to 10sec for the test_skipping_older_events()
end-to-end test to avoid flakiness.
