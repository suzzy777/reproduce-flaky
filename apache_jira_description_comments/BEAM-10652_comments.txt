I've been having a hard time carving out time to work on this.  Don't let me be a blocker, if anyone else wants to address or has a timeline for needing this ( please take it – I do imagine eventually addressing, which is why I am not un-assigning myself, but very open to anyone addressing ).

[~kenn] – this is not complete/resolved, yet.  I got busy with other things ( and then actually kinda forgot about it ).  Updating mail settings here, so I receive notifications.  But, should be able to at least take a look this week.  

[~brucearctor] - no worries! That was actually a bulk comment on 900+ issues to find the ones that were stale. I've added you to the "Contributors" group and assigned you this ticket to accurately reflect the state of things.

[~bhulette] – [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16578] <- can you check this out?  Please advise if good to merge.  Comments within.  

[~kenn]  – can you have a look at the referenced issue (  [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16578]  ).  I think someone else should also LGTM, and I shouldn't just merge myself?  

 

All existing tests pass ( removed an unneeded one due to the change ), and I added some relevant new ones.  

LGTM from a single committer is enough to merge, and then any committer can do the merge. I'll take a look right now.

The code seems fine, but I don't really have the context around the BQ feature. Is this a change to BQ since we first wrote the IO? Or is the main IO code itself not safe to use in all these configurations?

I would ping [~chamikara] and maybe [~kjung520] in addition to [~bhulette].
