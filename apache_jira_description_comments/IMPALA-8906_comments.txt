Linking with IMPALA-8627, seems that [~vihangk1] has already fixed it [here|https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/983e3a66deef5bce52e9ebe74db8e2f86233d036/tests/query_test/test_observability.py#L313].

 

[~tmate] so is this safe to close then?

Appears this just happened in a nightly run: https://jenkins.impala.io/job/parallel-all-tests-nightly/1071/

[addStatsToProfile|https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/branch-3.3.0/fe/src/main/java/org/apache/impala/catalog/local/CatalogdMetaProvider.java#L529] displays the {{Hits}} or {{Misses}} when greater than 0. This logic however is not checked by the [observability test|https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/branch-3.3.0/tests/query_test/test_observability.py#L324].

I believe another parallel test fetched the {{PartitionLists}} metadata and the missing {{Misses}} profile record failed the test. I will update the test soon.

Removed the condition that prevents printing 0 values instead, usually 0 values are printed in the profile, also it makes the profile parsing easier.

IMPALA-8906: Fix flaky profile observability test

The test_query_profile_contains_query_compilation_metadata_load_events
is flaky because only non-zero stats are printed and the test is not
prepared to handle lines appearing based on conditions.

In general, zero values are printed in the profile as well, this makes
profile parsing simpler. Therefore, instead of changing the test the
condition has been removed as part of this change and the test is
updated accordingly.
