Test has failed again, so the fix wasn't sufficient.

rajinisivaram commented on pull request #6426: KAFKA-7976; Update config before notifying controller of unclean leader update
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6426
 
 
   When unclean leader election is enabled dynamically on brokers, we notify controller of the update before updating KafkaConfig. When processing this event, controller's decision to elect unclean leaders is based on the current KafkaConfig, so there is a small timing window when the controller may not elect unclean leader because `KafkaConfig` of the server was not yet updated. The PR fixes this timing window by using the existing `BrokerReconfigurable` interface used by other classes which  rely on the current value of `KafkaConfig`.
