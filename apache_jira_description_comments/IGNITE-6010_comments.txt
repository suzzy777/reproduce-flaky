    Fix test

----


[~NSAmelchev], LGTM.

The test became flaky after commit e05c012 where the timeout was decreased to 20s. Sometimes curators closed on session timeout (60 sec) and fail the test.

I prepared PR to fix the test:
- I added the additional block to ensure that clients were connected.
- Now session closes expected without timeouts and "wait for condition" block is excess.

Thanks for contribution.

Merged to master.
