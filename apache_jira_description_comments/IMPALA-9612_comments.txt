I think the race is similar to IMPALA-9611, where the writer doesn't hold the lock at any time between setting the atomic and signalling the CV. This allows the race I described on that JIRA.

IMPALA-9612: Fix race condition in RuntimeFilter::WaitForArrival

In function RuntimeFilter::WaitForArrival, there is a race condition
where condition variable arrival_cv_ may be signaled right after
thread get into the loop and before it call arrival_cv_.WaitFor().
This can cause runtime filter to wait the entire
RUNTIME_FILTER_WAIT_TIME_MS even though the filter has arrived or
canceled earlier than that. This commit avoid the race condition by
making RuntimeFilter::SetFilter and RuntimeFilter::Cancel acquire
arrival_mutex_ first before checking the value of arrival_time_ and
release arrival_mutex_ before signaling arrival_cv_.

Testing:
- Add new be test runtime-filter-test.cc
- Pass core tests.

IMPALA-9650: Fix flakiness in RuntimeFilterTest

IMPALA-9612 adds RuntimeFilterTest to the set of backend tests. It
adds a delay injection code in runtime-filter.cc to reproduce the race
condition. However, the delay injection code will be stripped out when
Impala is build with release config. This patch remove the NDEBUG
macro enclosing the delay injection code so that it will not be
stripped out in release build.

Testing:
- Ran and pass pass backend tests against release build.
