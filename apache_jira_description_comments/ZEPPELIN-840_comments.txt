    Great improvement!
    
    Quick question - is there a reason you prefer to keep some classes in ` scalding/src/main/scala/com/twitter/scalding/` vs ` scalding/src/main/scala/org/apache/zeppelin/scalding` ?
    
    Both CI failures happen on some tests, like I have not seen before
    ```
    org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.DummyNotebookRepo notebook storage class
    java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.DummyNotebookRepo
    
    and
    
    ZeppelinIT.testSparkInterpreterDependencyLoading:209 Â» ElementNotVisible Eleme...
    ```
    Seems not related but definitely deserves a JIRA with `flaky-test` label so we could look more into it

    As #862 is merged it should fix the CI, so please rebase on the latest master.

    @bzz 
    
    I had originally created ZeppelinScaldingShell in the org.apache.zeppelin.scalding package. I moved it to com.twitter.scalding so that I could access "private[scalding] var storedHdfsMode". I am planning to create a PR in https://github.com/twitter/scalding to make that field protected. Once that happens, I will move ZeppelinScaldingShell to org.apache.zeppelin.scalding. Does that make sense?
    
    I created https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-888 for the DummyNotebookRepo class not found issue.
    
    I merged #862 and the selenium test passed! But one of the jobs failed with the error below. I am going to start another build.
    https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-zeppelin/jobs/133162290
    [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-remote-resources-plugin:1.4:process (default) on project zeppelin: Error downloading resources archive. Could not transfer artifact org.apache.apache.resources:apache-jar-resource-bundle:jar:1.5-SNAPSHOT from/to codehaus-snapshots (https://nexus.codehaus.org/snapshots/): nexus.codehaus.org: Name or service not known
    
    I really appreciate you looking into the flaky builds and tests!

    @prasadwagle nice! 
    It definitely does, sounds as a great plan! What do you think about putting `//TODO(prasadwagle) ...` with this information to the class header docs? It would help next time somebody have this question, before the scalding version is updated.
    
    Also, do you plan to update any interpreter documentation as part of this PR or is it ready to merge?


Github user prasadwagle commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/917
  
    @felixcheung yes, it should be. I have moved the classes to org.apache.zeppelin.scalding but we need [this](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/pull/1563) scalding change. The scalding.version in scalding/pom.xml is 0.16.1-SNAPSHOT. I will change that when the scalding team publishes new artifacts. cc: @rubanm
    
    



Github user lresende commented on the issue:

    This seems to be moving the whole build to JDK8 and moving some components to only support scala 2.11 ? Is that really the plan ? 


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/917
  
    Hmm... I'm not sure sure we should move to jdk8 completely by default - there are some interpreters that only runs with jdk7 last time we checked. Similarly for Scala 2.1, but that's per-interpreter.


Github user lresende commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/917
  
    Agreed @felixcheung , at least we should have a discussion on the dev list if we plan to have some changes like this.


Github user prasadwagle commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/917
  
    @felixcheung @lresende I agree. I wanted to see the build errors before I started a discussion on the dev list. In the previous build, one check didn't complete, many failed with "Failed to transfer file: http://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-1.5.2/spark-1.5.2.tgz" and one succeeded. I am going to start the build again.

Github user prasadwagle commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/917
  
    There were build failures with the java 1.8 change that seemed due to flaky tests. 
    https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-zeppelin/builds/135174837
    I think we should investigate that in a separate PR, so I reverted the change.
    
    In the latest build, all checks succeeded except one that failed due a flaky test tracked in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-862.
    



Github user prasadwagle commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/917
  
    All checks passed in the last build. Can someone please review? There is interest in the cascading and scalding community for this interpreter.


Github user prasadwagle commented on the issue:

    @Leemoonsoo I understand and have made the changes you recommended. I also created https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-972.

    Looks good to me and merge if there're no more discussions
