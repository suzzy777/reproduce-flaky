Right now for a column to qualify as a unique column it has to meet the criteria: 
{code}
NDV >= numRows
{code}
when numRows is 1 this tends to be true ; but numRows is also 1 in cases when we are kinda operate in the blind - don't know how many row there are - more generatlly: with estimated column statistics.

As a sideeffect of qualifying all columns to be unique; after a few joins all column combinations became unique....so for a join between 3 tables which have (i,j,k) columns; then it will allocate {{i*j*k}} triplets of "unique column triplets".
