[~adenisso], this failed the unit tests on branch-1.7.0, can you investigate?
https://builds.apache.org/job/Ambari-branch-1.7.0/120/testReport/

[~afernandez], Just FYI It seems like it is from security and cert generation related from ambari-server, which our patch (ambari-web) has nothing to do 
https://builds.apache.org/job/Ambari-branch-1.7.0/121/ (the next execution) just passed too and I also just started an execution just in case.
Most probably this is a timing issue (which we should handle properly in any case) but not related to this particular fix?
Will let you know a result from the following job execution.


The build failure was in ambari-server in SSL tests and the changes were made in ambari-web, so seems unrelated. The later build on this branch succeeded https://builds.apache.org/job/Ambari-branch-1.7.0/121/, so this seems transient and unrelated.

Looks like flaky unit tests.
We saw the same UT failures on trunk a couple of days ago: https://builds.apache.org/job/Ambari-trunk-Commit/579/

Filed AMBARI-7821 to keep track of the UT failures.

Thank you [~u39kun]/[~afernandez] for reporting this.
Alejandro, feel free to ping us on those kind of things. We rely on your dedication as release master! :)
