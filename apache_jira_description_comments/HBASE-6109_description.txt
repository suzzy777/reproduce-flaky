The main points in this patch are:
 - lowering the number of copy of the RIT list
 - lowering the number of synchronization
 - synchronizing on a region rather than on everything

It also contains:
 - some fixes around the RIT notification: the list was sometimes modified without a corresponding 'notify'.
 - some tests flakiness correction, actually unrelated to this patch.
