The test was not flaky before the TCM commit:

https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2577/workflows/b0af145f-909f-4b7e-97cf-f6e1d46073e9

The test was flaky right after the TCM commit:

[https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2581/workflows/6754ca0a-f56c-49a1-88ff-6c15dcbfa23a/jobs/48893/tests]

Moving to open.Â 

500 runs haven't yielded any additoinal information: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2599/workflows/6a643e34-aeb3-47b2-9b00-3115367291a7/jobs/50695

I have also tried simulating, and running a bunch of times locally, no success.

Closing for now.

I guess some other ticket fixed it in the meantime. Thank you for looking into this, [~ifesdjeen] !
