Added tests to cover query cancellation scenarios over JDBC in TestJdbcDriver2,java.

1. Cancel the statement before query is executed
2. Cancel the statement after query is executed.
3. Cancel the statement after query errors due to bad SQL
4. Cancel the query twice while it is running.

[~djaiswal] Can you submit again for QA run? There were some changes that went in {{TestJdbcDriver2}} yesterday, which brought down the running time to ~60-70s. Want to be sure the new tests don't affect that in a major way. I'll also take a look at the patch shortly.

[~djaiswal] Nevermind, looks like the patch just had a fresh QA run. Please ignore my comment about rerunning. I'll take a look at the patch shortly.

Sure. I will refresh my code and try that.

Patch looks good. I just saw the latest test report and it doesn't add any overhead. +1 from my side.

Thanks Vaibhav.

Committed to master. Thanks Deepak.
