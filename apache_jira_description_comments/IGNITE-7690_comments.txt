    IGNITE-7690 Move shared memory suite (IpcSharedMemoryCrashDetectionSelfTest) to Ignite Basic 2

----


Please take a look. I've also updated Basic 2 suite on public TC.

Regarding separate class for Basic 2 suite - we can't do it as most of Basic 2 subsuitesÂ reside in different modules.

Looks good to me, [~agoncharuk] could you please merge?
