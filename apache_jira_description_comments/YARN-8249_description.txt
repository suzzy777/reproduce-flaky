Few REST endpoints like node label/ scheduler-conf etc are missing static user validation check. Writable apis should not be ran for static users. This is not a security hole as such as yarn.admin.acls will be configured to certain users in secure cluster correctly. However such a check will help to have same semantics across various apis.Â
