Can we add support for updating paragraph "text" (code) with new text. This will allow existing paragraph to be updated. Current alternative to perform this is to do multiple steps:

2) Create new paragraph with required "text"
3) Move new paragraph to index collected in step 1.

It would be nice to just be able to upgrade existing paragraph
