Awesome to see we are moving forward with the removal of aggregators.

However, I see that the PRs related to this ticket replace aggregators with metrics.

Since metrics are not supported yet in all runners, how is this going to work?

My chief concern is the success and failure counters in {{PAssert}} since these verify that {{RunnableOnService}} tests do in fact test what they are supposed to (There have been and are instances in which the runners did not perform the assertion but the test passed, and this masked an actual bug in the runner).

Excellent point [~aviemzur]. Big +1.

I agree that removing aggregators is important before the stable release, but not having them in at least the runners in master is kind of a blocker to do it, so maybe this is a bit premature to do it at this point in time.

Good point indeed. We have to move forward on metric impl in all runners ;)

Specifically, [~aviemzur] is talking about https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2263. If we now drop aggregators we will lose a valuable test signal and might introduce bugs without knowing it until we have Metrics working on the Flink Runner and `PAssert` verification ported to metrics.

Is Flink the only runner missing Metric support? How about the Apex Runner?

Apex runner does not support metrics either.

I think it used to be that aggregators checked that the test actually remembered to run a {{PAssert}} transform. Some of this is handled by {{TestPipeline}} now. But the new logic there means that a failure is a major bug in the runner or a bug in {{PAssert}}. I don't think it is really possible for a runner to have basic support for primitives and for an assert to fail to run, unless the whole pipeline fails, too, which is fine for failing the test. Am I missing some situation?

There are other places, like {{ReduceFnRunner}} where we need metrics or we lose the count of dropped elements.

`TestSparkRunner` does check the values of the success/failure aggregators in `PAssert`. I'm not sure if test classes for other runners to that as well.

As [~aljoscha] mentioned we are adding this assertion to Flink runner as well, and it has surfaced bugs which were silenced by the fact that the tests passed even though no {{PAssert}} assertions actually happened -  https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2263
All runners should add such an assertion as well, as they might also have silent bugs.
There is a ticket to change to doing this assertion in the {{TestPipeline}} side of things so that runner writers won't have to know to do this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1763
In any case, once all runners support metrics this can be done using metrics. 

(Note BEAM-1148 originally tracked porting PAssert off of Aggregators)

I don't believe Metrics will work for this. Specifically since most runners don't track values across committed bundles and instead only support attempted metrics, they may over or undercount.

Depending on a flaky value from Metrics for testing seems like it would be a step backwards in terms of flakiness of tests.

It may be useful to think about how to move PAsserts off aggregators/metrics towards something more reliable -- perhaps a deterministic completion sink that just writes the name of the assert that has been executed.

Agreed, we need to port PAssert verification to something reliable. Aggregators where not optimal for this but they were/are better than nothing. (As I learned from some silently failing tests on the Flink Runner.)

[~pabloem] Apex runner does not seem to support Aggregators either, so one less.

https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/b6b2e202ae8c5d3d1c081a1e24033380d7f55593/runners/apex/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/apex/ApexRunnerResult.java#L55-L55


To my understanding, aggregators and logical metrics are essentially equivalent; metrics are just nicer to use and easier to implement. It seems that support for aggregators - to the extent it exists in a runner - could be ported directly to the metrics API. That is consistent with all of the intent.

I have a PR (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2291) that changes PAssert to Metrics, and fixes it in the Spark runner (i.e. TestSparkRunner.java). I believe that the Dataflow Runner does not need any changes.

I think we should consider instead to move on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1763 and remove these assertions from TestSparkRunner. This will also remove the need for https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2263

As [~bchambers] mentioned, this should probably not be done using metrics, especially since metrics are not supported in all runners.

Remaining work:

* Rebuild DataflowWorker to stop using the three deprecated functions.
* Update the SDK with the new worker and remove the three deprecated functions.
* run a recursive grep on the code to check uses of the word Aggregator. E.g.,
