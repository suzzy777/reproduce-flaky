    ZOOKEEPER-2692: Fix race condition in testWatchAutoResetWithPending

    We occasionally run into an issue with testWatchAutoResetWithPending where we get flaky test behavior due to not being able to reliably predict when the client has received notification from each watch that may be fired (perhaps due to resource contention on the box running the tests). This patch works around that by waiting for a one second quiet period, after which we can more safely assume all watches that will be fired have been fired.
    
    Here is an example of the test failure: https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-jdk8/935/testReport/junit/org.apache.zookeeper.test/WatcherTest/testWatchAutoResetWithPending/

    +1. Chat with @afine offline, this is hard to reproduce without introducing some delays in the process callback.

    Side note - the other day was discussing this with @rakeshadr. If we use the merge script without resolving the JIRA, or the JIRA was already resolved, the PR will be left open after the script execution. Not sure if this is a bug but fyi.

ZOOKEEPER-2692: Fix race condition in testWatchAutoResetWithPending (hanm: rev d13d2f08c730a81d73d58f64a0ae448639dede2b)

Looks like this introduces a regression on one watcher test.

[~abrahamfine] Could you please look at why this test fail and patch it?

[~hanm] I am not convinced that this is a regression. Although the timing of the failure seems to indicate a regression, the WatcherTest class modified in ZOOKEEPER-2692 is unrelated to WatchEventWhenAutoResetTest. 

In addition we see this failure happening before this patch was committed here: https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-solaris/1505/

Perhaps this deserves its own JIRA?

[~abrahamfine] I haven't looked into details on these tests but looks like your change was not impacting the failures here. Though I am pretty sure this flaky test is new, it sounds good to close this jira and open another one to track it.

[~hanm] I am getting same error as you mentioned above(Testcase: org.apache.zookeeper.test.WatchEventWhenAutoResetTest.testNodeDataChanged). Any update on that issue? Or is there any jira created which i can refer to?

I don't think anyone is working on fixing that issue. Feel free to go ahead and create a JIRA (and better, assign it to yourself and start fixing it:)
