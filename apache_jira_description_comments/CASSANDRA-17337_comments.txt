I don't think I've seen it in CI yet, but I can reproduce this on 4.0 and trunk also.  The flaky decorator from CASSANDRA-11729 is preventing most of the failures from becoming visible.

With the flaky decorator removed (and my reading of CASSANDRA-11729 is that it should only fail 1 in ~100 times) this will fail in ~20 runs or much less on 3.11, 4.0, and trunk, but not on 3.0.  I went as far back as 3.11.3 (build problems) and couldn't find a version that passed with which to bisect any further, and I'm not sure how long this has been failing, but it may have been hidden by the decorator for a long time.

Attached is the test extracted to the cql it attempts to loop 10 times, but this passes as many times as I've looped it through cqlsh.

I think I've spent enough cycles on this, and the path left is not simple.  If it is a long running bug, it's not one of great importance to solve, so I feel like this is going to be 99% effort for 1% gain.

Meh doesn't repro for me. The only opportunity for improvement I can think of is waiting for schema agreement after [this|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/trunk/secondary_indexes_test.py#L164] line. But given I can't see any past stack traces I have no idea if that would help. I suggest we close until it repros again?

That works for me, I don't see it in butler anywhere.

Just saw [the very same failure|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2595/workflows/52ae3e38-7ec3-4b94-9e90-372f820d0e47/jobs/26052] inÂ {{{}test_6924_dropping_cf{}}}, which is very similar to {{{}test_6924_dropping_ks{}}}.

Didn't manage to reproduce it again with the multiplexer, neither in [trunk|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2596/workflows/d0168f1d-08e2-46a4-9196-a3fee86e4683/jobs/26078] nor in [the patch branch|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2597/workflows/7de892cf-bee6-48ee-886c-8d6c33aae0a7/jobs/26085] where I hit it for the first time.
