Can someone help create a new Target Version that I can apply to the patches that are waiting for Hadoop3 master branch? Maybe "0.10" or "1.0".

[~ewohlstadter], [~gopalv], do you mind if i take this jira? As I have been a release manager for tez in the past, I can help to align code changes and branches changes necessary to support the process.

To keep the git commits clean. Will address 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT change and branch-0.9 branch creation as part of TEZ-3926 and will leave hadoop 3 dependency change as part of this JIRA.

As far as initial hadoop dependency, we should depend on 3.0.2 to reflect the need to depend on shaded jar dependency. This will prevent ourselves from depending on alpha or alpha2 version as well as deprecated 3.0.0 versions or unshaded 3.0.1 versions.

[~jeagles]: assigned to you, please let me know if you hit any roadblocks - I can take this back up

I'm only seeing one test failure now against Hadoop3.

 

It seems like it may just be the environment where I'm running the tests. I'm going to try resubmitting [~jeagles] patch on this Jira to get new test results on the Apache infra.

 

Does anyone know what might be causing this one for me? I will look into it, but I wanted to see if someone might already have context about it.

The latest patch submission is flagging {{TestTaskScheduler}} as timing out.

On my local I see this test passing. I'll file a flaky test JIRA for TestTaskScheduler.

[~jeagles] [~jlowe]

FYI: I see now that TezQA doesn't report all problematic tests. 

Going through the console output log, I see these test also appear to have a problem (not sure which are Hadoop3 related).
 * {{org.apache.tez.history.TestHistoryParser}}
 * {{org.apache.tez.analyzer.TestAnalyzer}}
 * {{org.apache.tez.dag.history.ats.acls.TestATSHistoryWithACLs}}

 

As indicated by the fact that they have this pattern in the console log ("Tests run: 0"), e.g.:
{code:java}

Running org.apache.tez.dag.history.ats.acls.TestATSHistoryWithACLs

Results :

Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0{code}

v2 patch looks good to me. +1. Committing this to master shortly.

Thank you for the patch [~jeagles]. Committed to master.

[~jeagles]

Are there any remaining blockers for cutting a release from master? Can we make a call on the mailing list now?
