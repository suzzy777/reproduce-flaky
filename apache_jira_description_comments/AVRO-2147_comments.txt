BTW – not sure how to best include a test for this: explicitly testing the performance seems like it would create a flaky test, and the only other way I can think of would require instrumenting the code somehow so that the test can assert that serializing N objects doesn't require O(N) schema objects to be created. 

I have separately attached the full modified test.proto and the test I put in the description, since jira mangles the code otherwise. 

Patch looks fine to me.  I don't think we need to commit the perf test.

Does anyone object to committing this patch?
