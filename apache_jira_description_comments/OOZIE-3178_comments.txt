as part of OOZIE-3207, it's suggested to run a test with 
{code:java}
-Papache-release{code}
 

[~gezapeti] hope you don't mind me taking over. I tested the command and it failed due to empty <p> tags. OOZIE-3178-00.patch fixes my build failure.

Thanks for the contribution [~dbist13]!

Would you mind also taking care of [*{{bin/test-patch-09-javadoc}}*|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/bin/test-patch-09-javadoc#L99-L104] to run {{mvn javadoc:javadoc}} to also warn on such errors to prevent the issue from reoccurring? Thanks!

[~andras.piros] happy to do so, not sure which report pre hook is executed against as on my environment, I have to run mvn javadoc:javadoc goal then followed by mvn site and I'm getting
{code:java}

can someone point me to the right report so I know how to modify the pre hook? Also, javadoc plugin 3.0 is out and I'm updating the patch with that in mind.

 

also, addressing a minor issue in OOZIE-2363

[~dbist13] thanks for working so hard on the issue!

An example of calling {{test-patch}} locally:
{noformat}
bin/test-patch --patch=/path/to/OOZIE-3178-01.patch --dirty-scm --tasks=JAVADOC -Papache-release --verbose
{noformat}

I've just tried it and calling
{quote}
>> [37] 16:23 : oozie (master) :: ./bin/mkdistro.sh -Papache-release -DskipTests
{quote}
reproduces the issue we were having during the last release.

Also [~dbist13], I'd really appreciate it if you'd change the pre-commit hook as well in a way to prevent these errors in the future.

[~andras.piros] & [~gezapeti] please review the latest patch, I added a new function to look for javadoc errors.

Thanks for looking into this! 
I've tried out the new pre-commit hook and it looks like it's working great.
+1 (pending jenkins) for patch-02

Also attached the output for the JAVADOC step. Both pre-patch and post-patch steps are failing with the same error.
[~dbist13], can you take a look at it?

Thanks [~kmarton] for taking this over. I think this can be separated into 2 or 3 separate issues:
# some steps of the current precommit are failing but we get a +1 anyways ( see OOZIE-3304 for a recent example)
# Javadoc check builds are broken in the pre-commit
# the current master has javadoc errors.

Feel free to open subtasks for these (or more if you'd prefer to).

Thank you [~gezapeti] for the hints! 

I would handle in this issue only the javadoc errors, and open another issue(s) for fixing the pre-commit.

./bin/mkdistro.sh -Papache-release is successfull. 

[~andras.piros], [~gezapeti] what do you think about resolving this issue, and fixing the pre-commit issues in OOZIE-3316? 

[~kmarton] did you have to modify the sources in order you can do {{bin/mkdistro.sh \-Papache\-release}}? Are javadocs also generated?

[~andras.piros], the javadocs are generated without adding any changes. The javadoc errors were eliminated by this commit: [https://github.com/apache/oozie/commit/2805ab66fb28114c7d3de892c0f6f317626cb65c]

 

[~kmarton] thanks for the clarification! We can close this JIRA then.

Made OOZIE-3317 a critical issue for {{5.1.0}} and OOZIE-3318 a blocker for {{5.1.0}}.

Thank you, [~andras.piros]! Then closing this issue.

Closing issue; Oozie 5.1.0 is released.
