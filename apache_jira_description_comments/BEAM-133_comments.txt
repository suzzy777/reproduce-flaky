Definitely an infrastructure issue. 
You can see in the console output that in builds that failed the Spark runner build tries to download from the MapR repository: 
[INFO] Building Spark Beam Runner 0.4.3-SNAPSHOT

I guess our Jenkins uses multiple instances / machines, does it ? 
If so, can we check if the failure is on the same one ?

Anyway it's a cache issue. 

Acknowledged. I'll take this over.

We've changed the Jenkins projects to use a Maven repository local to the workspace. This should fix the problem; please let us know if it does not.

Marking resolved for now.
