The test passes based on commit c5cc81d8e31ba76833adf25b6c357205745c23ad, the one prior to 0ae0edcd630aa1dcb6c47ea11fa4367ae0a5baa8

You mean after the commit of HBASE-17917,this test is more flakey?

The test fails 100% now :
https://builds.apache.org/job/HBASE-Find-Flaky-Tests/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dashboard.html

Will check this.

Found the issue. Will raise a new JIRA to fix it. It needs some discussion. Will link this failure to the other new JIRA.

See HBASE-18055
