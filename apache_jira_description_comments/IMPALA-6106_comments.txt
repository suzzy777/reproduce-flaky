IMPALA-6106: handle comments before set in test parser

The tpcds-q22a.test test file has a comment before a "set" command.
The regex used to match "set" commands does not handle preceding

Testing:
Ran the test with the below command and confirmed that DECIMAL_V2 was
automatically set back to 0.

  impala-py.test tests/query_test/test_tpcds_queries.py -k 22a \
      --capture=no
