looks like the executor was lost due to some unknown reasons, and is not related to this specific test. BTW this failure doesn't show up frequently(I only saw it once), shall we close this ticket?

If we keep this issue, what about removing the target version from this issue?

Doesn't seem that flaky, so closing for now.
