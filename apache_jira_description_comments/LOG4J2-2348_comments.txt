Same random issue here for another project. Any insights on your side?

https://github.com/flapdoodle-oss/de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo/issues/174

Unfortunately I have not had a great deal of time to debug this issue. When I disable caching entirely, writing artifacts to random temporary directories I can no longer reproduce the failure, however the artifact must be downloaded for each test run.

[LOG4J2-2348] workaround flaky "Operation not permitted" failures in mongo tests

mongo tests intermittenly fail with an "Operation not permitted"
IOException when trying to execute the mongod extracted by
de.flapdoodle.embed.process; this seems to be related to surefire
running tests in parallel. Work around that here by forcing serial
execution of the mongo tests.

This closes #201
