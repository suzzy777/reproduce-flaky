IMPALA-9766: make TestParquet tests deterministic

test_page_size_counters and test_bytes_read_per_column were
written in a way so that queries were short-circuited by
the limit and could terminate early before the scans made
much progress. Add an order by to make the queries deterministic.

Testing:
Looped the tests locally for ~10 minutes. Before the change
the issue reproduced very quickly.
