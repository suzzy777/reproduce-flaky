Hi [~ashutoshc] [~spena] Just wanted to get your opinion on this. Is this something that you think will be useful/consistent or if you see any issues if we decide to implement this?

I didn't know the auto.purge exists. The property sounds pretty useful for avoiding sending files to trash in some tables. If this already works for DROP, then I think it should be consistent with INSERT OVERWRITE as well. Although I don't know if users would get confused that 'auto.purge' is related only to DROP ... PURGE.

[~ashutoshc] [~ctang.ma] What do you guys think about this?

Adding the first version of the patch to trigger the pre-commit. Will be submitting second version with additional test cases

The tests were working for me locally. Changed the implementation of the tests to make it more robust. Also, added more logs in the test case to help debugging in case it fails again. Added couple of more tests

Test failure is flaky and has been already reported in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-16256

[~vihangk1] Thanks for the patch. I think the method in HiveMetaStoreFsImpl.deleteDir has the similar logic as you would like to change in FileUtils.moveToTrash, could we combine or reuse these methods? Also could you add a qtest for insert overwrite a table with encryption zone and enabled trash? I think the test should fail without this patch.

Hi [~ctang.ma] Thanks for the review. I changed the implementation of {{HiveMetaStoreFsImpl.deleteDir}} so that it reuses FileUtils.moveToTrash method like you suggested.

Also investigated encrypted tables, I realized that in case of encrypted table the {{INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE encrypted_table ...}} command was anyways ignoring the error thrown when old data was moved to Trash. It logs a warning and then deletes the data when moving to Trash to fails. With my patch there would be no behavioral change with respect to encrypted tables. With the patch, if the table is encrypted and auto.purge is true, then it doesn't attempt to move the data to trash in the first place, so the warning would not be logged as well.

Similarly, for truncate table. Both the commands use FileUtils.moveToTrash in the backend to delete the data which catches the exception when table is encrypted and simply logs the warning. So with the patch both there would not be any change with respect to encrypted tables for both INSERT OVERWRITE and TRUNCATE commands since they were already ignoring the Trash.

This would still be more efficient when the tables are located on S3 since the code does not attempt to move them to trash as well.

Also, found another unrelated bug during this investigation regarding the inconsistency with respect to "EXTERNAL" property and EXTERNAL table. Created HIVE-16324 for that.

Updating the patch which includes additional q file test and modifies the existing truncate table tests to work around HIVE-16324

Hi [~ctang.ma] Can you please review? Thanks!

The patch looks good to me, +1.

Committed to 2.3.0 & 3.0.0. Thanks [~vihangk1] for the patch.

Doc note:  This needs to be documented, with version information, in the DML and DDL docs.

* [DML -- Inserting data into Hive Tables from queries -- Synopsis | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DML#LanguageManualDML-Synopsis.1]
* [DML -- Writing data into the filesystem from queries -- Synopsis | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DML#LanguageManualDML-Synopsis.2]
* [DDL -- Truncate Table | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-TruncateTable]

See Drop Table for an example of how to document this:

* [DDL -- Drop Table | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-DropTable]

Added a TODOC2.3 label.

Thanks [~leftylev] for the links. I have updated the DML and DDL language guide for this in the INSERT OVERWRITE and TRUNCATE table section. This patch does not affect the "DML – Writing data into the filesystem from queries – Synopsis" link you gave above. Please let me know if you need any further changes with the text and I will be happy to help.

Hi [~leftylev] Isnt the documentation provided above sufficient? I saw my name on you email on the dev-list regarding 2.3.0 release. May be I had to remove the TODOC label?

(Blush.)  My bad -- I meant to review your docs, then remove the TODOC label.  But my backlog kept growing and I fell behind, sorry.

So I'll remove the label right now and review the docs later tonight.

Congrats -- you're ahead of the peloton!

Good docs Vihang, thanks.

I added some links from auto.purge in the list of table properties:

* [DDL -- TBLPROPERTIES | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-listTableProperties]

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
