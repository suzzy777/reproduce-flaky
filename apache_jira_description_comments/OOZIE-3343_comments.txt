The cause of the false +1 report is that, in OOZIE-332, during distro analysis, the maven command was extended with performing a clean, so  all the surefire reports generated by the tests are deleted, and when the test report is created, it will find no errors and warnings, so even if there were failures, it reports +1 for the tests.

The failed test is unrelated. However I've opened OOZIE-3352 for fixing it.

[~kmarton] it seems to me that the latest {{patch 004}} based test run [gives following test error|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-OOZIE-Build/850/consoleFull]:
{noformat}

Can you please have a look why:
- there are no test runs marked as erroneous but {{TestCallableQueueService#testPriorityExecutionOrder()}} should be
- three times lines are too long inside {{bin/test-patch-20-tests}}

oups! 004 it seems to be the wrong patch. I have uploaded now the newest one 005. Let`s see what the new precommit build will say.

Looks much better [~kmarton]! Now I can see the one failing test in the test output :) nice job!

A couple of nits:
- please take care of too long lines
- wording: *Tests errors* should be *Tests in error*, and *Tests timeouts* should be *Tests timed out*
