If in production you are racing inserts with column drops, then you are using the feature incorrectly. Drop column exists to clean up schema from columns that are no longer in use - and to trigger their eventual removal as compactions occur.

Switching precision to micros would help with the flaky test, but that's about it. Not even bringing up concurrent writes happening on other nodes that are not addressed by the JIRA linked here. Anyways, I'd say changing this is a hassle that doesn't improve anything in practice, beyond some tests, which is easier done on the test side.

I agree that considering the impact of the change and the usecase, this ticket is a super low priority thing.
From a correctness point of view, I still believe that it is valid issue.
