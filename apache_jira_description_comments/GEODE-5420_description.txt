This can occur when:

1) Events are added to queuedEvents during message dispatcher initialization
2) Events are added to giiQueue while serving initial image to peer

We have seen this issue when QRM messages are being processed after becoming primary.  This causes the event to be removed prematurely from the HAContainer, and then the wrapper is in a bad state (null client update message) when we try to replace the event.
