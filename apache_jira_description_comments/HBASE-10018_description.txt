Issues with prefetching are:
- we do two calls to meta: one for the exact row, one for the prefetch 
- it's done in a lock
- we take the next 10 regions. Why 10, why the 10 next?
- is it useful if the table has 100K regions?

Options are:
- just remove it
- replace it with a reverse scan: this would save a call
