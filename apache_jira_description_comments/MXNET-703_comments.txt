No worries.  What you're asking is clear.  So the underlying library
(onnx-tensorrt) moved to this version and opset soon after migrating to
TRT5.  Almost immediately we began seeing serious correctness regressions
with the old onnx version and opset, so updating them to a supported
version seems like the path of least resistance to enable TRT5 support.
After changing the opset and updating the library the output is exactly as
we'd expect (i.e. matching MXNets output).  So basically we want to update
onnx-tensorrt to fix bugs and support new hardware, to do so we need to
serialize onnx in exactly this format.

 Review comment:
   I see. To me it's just not clear why these specific versions have been
chosen and what will happen if either side gets updated.
   I'm on my phone, so sorry for being so Brief. Let me know if you would
like be to elaborate my question
