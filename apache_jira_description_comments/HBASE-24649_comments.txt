[~vjasani] [~ndimiduk].

[~zhangduo] sorry I just came to know that you just created this Jira.

I have just fixed the exact thing that you have mentioned in the description as part of this addendum: [https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/1988]

The build is +1, and I have also committed the same patch with these two backport PRs: 

1. [https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/1985]

2. [https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/1983]

and keeping an eye on the build. Will merge the backport PRs only after build provides +1 for respective branches.

Nick already mentioned yesterday about the possible failure but it was my mistake that I was actually running test *TestSimpleRegionNormalizer* locally to reproduce the issue and not *TestSimpleRegionNormalizerOnCluster*. And yes, you are absolutely right about normalizer also submitting merge plan together with split plan and hence the unchanged count. Earlier, this particular behaviour was masked because of the fact that split plan execution was blocking and merge plan was non-blocking, and that's what HBASE-24588 has changed: To make both execution plans non-blocking.

Thanks for reporting and apologies for the trouble you had to go through.

Flaky looks good for master branch: [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/job/master/test_results_analyzer/]

OK, let's keep an eye on the flaky dashboard to see if the test is stable after the addendum. If no problem let's close this issue.

Fixed by addendum of HBASE-24588.

Thanks guys.
