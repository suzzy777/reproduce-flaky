Note for the reviewer: {{CompressedChunkReader.Standard}} is a {{RebuffererFactory}} where the main method at use is {{CompressedChunkReader.instantiateRebufferer()}}. That one wraps the reader in a {{BufferManagingRebufferer}} which will call {{close()}} and it's {{AutoClosable}} also. I have checked for uses of the reader in the code and as expected it is being closed/auto closed so I expect the {{ThreadLocal}} to be properly removed and not leak now.

CI runs in the PRs.

After talking with [~blerer] it seems there are better ways to solve this issue so moving back to in progress.

4.0 PR squashed, 3.11 PR ready and tests results attached to the PR.

The PRs have been approved and the CI runs look good.  

The patch was committed into cassandra-3.11 at 3f73c16d50a80c574dd004c59bfaa6042dcd5781  and merged into trunk

Thanks [~blerer] and [~blambov] for your help reviewing.
