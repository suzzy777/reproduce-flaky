We don't start yarn unless HDFS is also running - https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/testdata/cluster/admin#L70. 

We also don't start various other services, including hive server 2 https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/testdata/bin/run-all.sh#L79 .

This has been a persistent pain point for testing, because we can't load data and can't run many tests against those filesystems (see all the SkipIfS3 , etc annotations). Even worse, it can result in hard-to-debug failure modes like IMPALA-9345.
