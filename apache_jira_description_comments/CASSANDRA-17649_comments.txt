This has been reproduced on Circle using the patch for CASSANDRA-17649. Using that patch, the config with vnodes can be generated with
{code:java}
.circleci/generate.sh -m \
  -e REPEATED_UTEST_TARGET=test-jvm-dtest-some \
  -e REPEATED_UTEST_VNODES=true \
  -e REPEATED_UTEST_COUNT=10 \
  -e REPEATED_UTEST_CLASS=org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.TopPartitionsTest  {code}
We have initially seen this failing on [the CI runs|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1637/workflows/1a88c5ec-536e-4f55-bacd-dba538c77c33/jobs/11307/tests] for CASSANDRA-17571.

^you probably mean the patch for CASSANDRA-17616

Yes, thanks, I meant CASSANDRA-17616.

This seems to be a test issue.

Running the test class In a loop with only incremental repair was [always passing|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=basic-range-tombstone&filter=all]. 

The moment we run it parameterized, incremental and preview repairs seem to crash. Looking into the repair method in the test class, we see the nodetool  command was successfully triggered but we don't check that the repair has been completed.

I added some additional checks and the test seems not to be flaky anymore.

[~marcuse], do you mind to review the patch as the original author of this test? Or maybe [~dcapwell] ?

Sad but agree with the patch.  The issue is documented in another JIRA about issues with repair, but IR completes and shuts down on coordinator before the peers (we sent commit and exit, so the peer may still be running the repair by the time we start the second one).

+1

+1 from me as well

I had to do something similar to fix {{ReparErrorsTest#testRemoteSyncFailure()}}, although in that case it was just relaxing a check on parent sessions.

(CASSANDRA-16909 is the other Jira of current issues w/ repair.)

Thank you both!
