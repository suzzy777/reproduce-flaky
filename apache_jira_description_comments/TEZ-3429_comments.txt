+1. Looks good, after the test case failures are resolved.

Thanks [~sseth]! Per https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-TEZ-Build/1970//consoleFull and local run, TestRecovery passes. The above console output has error in TestContainerReuse which will be fixed by TEZ-3000; but it didn't list it as test failure. Maybe some flakiness in the mvn junit?

This patch seems to be very good at surfacing all the flaky tests :). Running through jenkins again.
