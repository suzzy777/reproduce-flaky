The root cause for this flaky test is described in this ticket: KAFKA-12495. I'll apply workaround in this flaky test first to make the tests reliable. And then, refactor and add more tests in KAFKA-12495. Thanks.

Hey [~showuon] what's the status here? This test is failing. on almost every build I've seen lately. Is this a bug in the test, or possibly one in Connect itself? If the former, can we temporarily disable it until you have a fix ready? cc [~kkonstantine]

[~ableegoldman], sorry, I forgot to update status here. The PR to fix the root cause of this flaky test was ready for review([https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10367,) |https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10367]so I didn't work around this test. 

 

But if it might takes some time to review the PR, I can workaround this test first. What do you think, [~kkonstantine] ?

And, answer your question:

Is this a bug in the test, or possibly one in Connect itself?

>> A bug in connect when doing incremental cooperative rebalance

 

Thanks.

[~chia7712], Mind if I take this ticket over? Thank you.

Sure!

This is a corner case that appears frequently in this test. 

I have a more fundamental fix in mind for this and other similar cases. I'll attempt a PR in the next few weeks. 
We can disable the test in the meantime. It used to fail once in a while but I understand that this occurs more often now. 

[~showuon] thanks for taking a stab at the fix. I have some reservation re: the approach in [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10367]
I'll able to return for a review and express my concerns early next week. 




  

[~kkonstantine], thanks for your response. OK, we can discuss for the better fix.

[~ableegoldman], let's disable this test first as in this PR: [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10408.] 

 

Thank you.

Ok I merged the PR to ignore this test -- please remember to un-ignore it once the problem has been fixed. I'm going to mark this ticket as a blocker for 3.0 so we don't forget about this test. Thanks!

Thanks, [~ableegoldman] , I also put a note in KAFKA-12495 to remind the ticket assignee. Thanks.

As mentioned above, this failure corresponds to a corner case that does not seem to appear in practice often. The current suggestion to allow for consecutive revocations carries some risk. I have another fix in mind that I'd like to explore. In the meantime I'm punting this issue to the next release. 

Moving to the next release as we are past the 3.1 release code freeze.

The flakiness with this test was fixed as part of this change=> https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12561/files#diff-7c0517709aeed38eadffb16dc43b7fc3ba8a7e9b3069f3c5a5c423caf6473470L273.

We haven't seen flaky behaviour since this PR got merged. Closing. cc [~showuon]

Thanks [~sagarrao] !
