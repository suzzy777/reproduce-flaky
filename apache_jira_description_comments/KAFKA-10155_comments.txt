This issue will be resolved by KAFKA-10147

Oh cool, thanks for the heads up. I'll assign this ticket to you then

We still see test failures:Â [https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk14-scala2.13/1172/testReport/kafka.admin/ReassignPartitionsUnitTest/testModifyBrokerThrottles/]

Are we sure it's fixed properly?

The fix was only merged 6 hours ago. Did it fail on a build that was kicked off less than 6 hours ago?

Oh. I was just looking at the comment that is 5 days old. Thanks for clarifying!
