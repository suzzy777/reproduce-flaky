Curiously, it looks like this test hasn't failed recently in the pull request builder ([link|https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/24351/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.streaming/ReceivedBlockTrackerSuite/block_addition__block_to_batch_allocation_and_cleanup_with_write_ahead_log/history/]).  However, it looks like it has failed on-and-off in the Maven builds ([link|https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/Spark-Master-Maven-pre-YARN/1132/hadoop.version=1.0.4,label=centos/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.streaming/ReceivedBlockTrackerSuite/block_addition__block_to_batch_allocation_and_cleanup_with_write_ahead_log/history/]).  Perhaps the problem could be related to test suite initialization working differently in Maven than SBT?  Just a theory; maybe it actually _has_ failed in the PRB and the recent test history is just a lucky streak.

Actually, scratch that theory: here's a failure in the Master SBT build: https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/Spark-Master-SBT/1206/

/cc [~hshreedharan], you might want to take a look at this issue, too.  This test seems to fail intermittently on Jenkins.  Since this is a new test, I think we should fix its flakiness in its own PR.

Looks like an HDFS bug - and this looks like it affects a really old version of HDFS (1.0.2). This code is all within RawLocalFileSystem.java is listing the files and the calling getFileStatus on each one of them - and for some reason a file which was returned from the listing itself is missing in the getFileStatus call (newer versions of HDFS simply eat the FileNotFoundException).

Ah, so this is the issue:
tracker3.cleanupOldBatches(batchTime2) eventually ends up calling deleteFiles() in WriteAheadLogManager which is run in another thread. The thread may or may not be done before the getWrittenLogData call is made. So if the deletion happens in between the list call and the getFileStatus call happening in HDFS, this race conditions gets hit.
