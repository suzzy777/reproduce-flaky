Currently Zookeeper exposes min, max and average since server start request latency.

It'd also be useful to be able to calculate latency over a given time period. This patch exposes the total latency, and count of number of request. By tracking how these values increase over time, your monitoring system can calculate the average latency over a given period of time.

This only provides milliseconds, as that's what's currently there.


I'm seeing a test failure on ClientPortBindTest.testBindByAddress, this appears to be due to my IPv6 setup.
