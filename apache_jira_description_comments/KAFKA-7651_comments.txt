The test failure is related to SSL handshake. In general SSL handshake is a stateful operation without timeout. Thus it is understandable the SSL logic in the test may be flaky if the GC pause is long or there is ephemeral network issue in the test.

There are same test failure for 2.0 branch in https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-2.0-jdk8/183/testReport/junit/kafka.api/SaslSslAdminClientIntegrationTest/testMinimumRequestTimeouts.

Since user has been running Kafka 2.0.0 well without major issues, the test failure here should not be a blocking issue for 2.1.0 release.

kafka.api.SaslSslAdminClientIntegrationTest.testMinimumRequestTimeouts failed again during PR build for Java 8 and Java 11

Happened again: [https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk8-scala2.11/19939/testReport/junit/kafka.api/SaslSslAdminClientIntegrationTest/testMinimumRequestTimeouts/]

One more: [https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk8-scala2.11/19936/testReport/junit/kafka.api/AdminClientIntegrationTest/testMinimumRequestTimeouts/]

This should have been fixed in [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6360]

Updating fixed version from 2.2.1 to 2.2.0 because we cut a new RC.
