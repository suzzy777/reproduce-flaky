Attach the patch.

* TestVertexImpl failed due to race issue between Initializer thread and AsynDispatcher thread, besides the failure in the description, also fix some other potential places.
* TestExceptionPropagation due to timeout, increase the time for test

[~sseth], please help review it

[~jeffzhang] - rather than waiting for initStarted and then sleeping for 1 second, the test will be more robust if you wait for the expected FINAL state - which is FAILED on most of the tests. The test will eventually timeout if the state is not reached.

The sequence re-ordering in initialize() looks good though.

Eventually, it may be better to use one of the ControlledInputInitializers - but that can wait for a separate jira.

Thanks [~sseth], update the patch, please help review it. 

+1. Looks good. Thanks [~zjffdu]

Committed to master & branch-0.5

This commit looks like it was busted as it was pushed to "branc-0.5" instead of branch-0.5 - please note the typo.

https://github.com/apache/tez/tree/branc-0.5

[~zjffdu] Can you please verify? 

Also, this branch should be deleted once it is verified that any mistaken commits to it have been consolidated to their respective correct branch.

Also, looks like there was an addendum commit but the patch has not been uploaded to jira. 

Attach the addendum patch.  ( 300 seconds is not enough, increase the timeout to 600 seconds )

Sorry for making the typo mistake.  branch-0.5 has got the correct commit , and delete the branc-0.5.
