The admission control test can take over half an hour to run with all the exhaustive combinations. 
{code}
$ time impala-py.test tests/custom_cluster/test_admission_controller.py --workload_exploration_strategy="functional-query:exhaustive" 
...
real    41m44.964s
user    1m55.404s
sys     0m12.180s
{code}

The system is mostly idle during that time.

We should speed up the test if possible without making it flaky and, if that isn't possible, consider running the stress test as part of a separate build.
