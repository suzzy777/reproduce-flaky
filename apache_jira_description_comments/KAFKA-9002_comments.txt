I cannot reproduce the issue locally any more after 160+ runs, and by looking into the code I believe the original root cause is because we are comparing two lists and hence ordering is restricted: it must be `topic1, topic2` and `topic2, topic` would not succeed. Before KIP-429 we would revoke `topic1` and then try to add both `topic1` and `topic2` but there are metadata race condition that they are added as `topic2, topic1`, whereas in KIP-429 we would not revoke `topic1` but only call onPartitionsAssigned and add `topic2` so the order is always `topic1, topic2`. So this is not flaky anymore even on comparing lists.

I'm going to add a minor commit with some comments explaining and warning people who may change KIP-429 behavior about this and then close the ticket.
