According to dfs -count command line help, -t option must be used along with -q.
* However, the current behavior is that  -t can be used without -q, it's just silently ignored. 
* In addition, -t may also be used with -u. 
* The FileSystemShell doc does not state -t must be used along with -q. This should either be enforced in the code, or update the doc/command line.
* Also, the list of possible parameters for -t option is not described in the doc. Looking at the code (Count.java), the list of possible parameters are either empty string (="all"), "all", "ram_disk", "ssd", "disk" or "archive" (caseless)
