The change in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE-2791 hardcoded replication factor to be 3 when using multi-threaded copying while single-threaded copy will follow the replication factor in hdfs-site.xml.

[https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/tools/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/tools/OozieSharelibCLI.java#L391]

This could be problematic when a cluster has less than 3 data nodes. Since the replication can never be 3 in this case, hdfs report will show a lot of files are under replicated.
{code:java}
$  hdfs dfsadmin -report | head

Blocks with corrupt replicas: 0
Missing blocks: 0
Missing blocks (with replication factor 1): 0

And the message from hdfs fsck will be like
