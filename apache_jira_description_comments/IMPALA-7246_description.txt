The failure observed in IMPALA-6960 occurred again while testing [https://gerrit.cloudera.org/c/10704/]

The query is different, however the cause of failure is the same. In this case, the profile for Instance e7462de57ef6fd00:25f810c300000005 (host=ip-172-31-28-156:22000) is empty. The query returned the expected results, but the runtime profile wasn't updated. 

I have attached the failure logs.
