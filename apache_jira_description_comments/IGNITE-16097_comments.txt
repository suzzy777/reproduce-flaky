All these tests fail due to excessive re-election of the leader.
 # Most of the tests were fixed by increasing the election timeout to 1000ms.
 # testTripleNodesWithReplicatorStateListener and testLeaderTransferWithReplicatorStateListener fail due to a bug introduced in the ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-15528.
The current term must be read under the writeLock. But after the changes in IGNITE-15528, it began to be read in asynchronous code, without writeLock.

[~ascherbakov] please review it.

Good catch with a current term reading out of lock.

I've left a minor comment.

Thanks, fixed, made org.apache.ignite.raft.jraft.core.TestCluster#ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MILLIS public.

Merged to the main branch.
