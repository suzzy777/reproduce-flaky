The command user_permission returns 0 rows if we specify default prefix. It works fine if we drop the prefix. This is because pattern matching of listTables doesn't take into account that nameAsString method doesn't include 'default' in it's output for the relevant tables. This method listTables is also used by delete, disable and enable commands when invoked with regular expression. Credits to [~mbertozzi] for coming up with this corner case.
