In cases, where new member's being added to to an existing ratis ring, raft configuration may not have the peer info of other nodes upfront while adding a new peer to an existing ring, leader Info can still be missing during installSnapshotNotification requests from leader to follower. In such cases, the leader info can be retreived from installSnapshot proto request. The idea here is to fix this case.
