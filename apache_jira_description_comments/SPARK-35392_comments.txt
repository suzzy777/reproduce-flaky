cc  [~ruifengz] per https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/111e9038d88feef63806457796f3b633f41ef32b and [~viirya] FYI

I see the first test failure at https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/101b0cc313cb4a6fb0027d470f313314d77bea08 .. but doesn't look related from a cursory look.

This GMM test is highly unstable, it tend to fail if: change number of partitions or just change the way to compute the sum of weights.

I think we can just disable this check of {{summary.logLikelihood}} for now, and use another test in the future.++

Â 

as to this failure, is it related to [https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32415?] [~srowen]

I think disabling is fine for now if it's tricky to fix.

Yes disable it. Yes almost certainly because of that change; we found that during testing it but tests did pass

+1 for disabling, too.

[~podongfeng] would you mind making a quick PR please?

[~hyukjin.kwon] OK, I will send a PR

Thanks man!
