   Thanks, @wangyum for checking this. Also, I am not sure about the related test anyway. That percentage of validating the limit was already changed 3 times.
   I am fine with both ways. If you think the upgrading of the jdk8 version is a better solution feel free to create another PR for this jira and I am happy to review/push it.
