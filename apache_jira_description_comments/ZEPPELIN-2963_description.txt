If a paragraph is cancelled before it is submitted to the interpreter, the status of the paragraph turns into Aborted (which is expected). However, the first subsequent run of this paragraph never goes to the interpreter and the paragraph ends up in Abort state eventually. The paragraph starts to run only after it is run the second time. See attached gif.
