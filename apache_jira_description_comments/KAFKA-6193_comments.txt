PR for this https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/4187

In some failing cases, there were exceptions while registering error metrics. But having looked into it, those exceptions were generated during shutdown initiated in tearDown and hence is not the cause of the failures. Will submit separate PR to fix that.

This test is failing for a PR I created. The Jenkins build is [here|https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk8-scala2.12/9469/testReport/kafka.admin/ReassignPartitionsClusterTest/shouldPerformMultipleReassignmentOperationsOverVariousTopics/]. 

Another instance of this failure that happened yesterday is [here|https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk8-scala2.12/9556/testReport/kafka.admin/ReassignPartitionsClusterTest/shouldPerformMultipleReassignmentOperationsOverVariousTopics/].

Some of the log errors seen when the test fails have been fixed by https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/4219/. If anyone sees this failure in a branch that includes PR #4219, please post the link to the failure to this JIRA.

Another failure:

Looking into it.
