[~misty] I tried to understand why are we adding {{org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.encoding}} to exclude list, but couldn't. Can you please explain it to me.

nit: Can we also change the link text from {{HADOOP-1581 HBASE: Un-openable tablename bug}} to {{HBASE-174 Un-openable tablename bug}}.

I excluded it from the Javadoc because it pulls in the broken BufferedDataBlockEncoder.html link into those other files because the extend BufferedDataBlockEncoder, but it is private. Can you think of another way to do it?

I left the HADOOP-1581 text there because that's probably what people would search for. It redirects to HBASE-174.

Yeah, it's weird that it's parent and child are all public but BufferedDataBlockEncoder itself is private.
But excluding the whole path from javadoc does not seem to be the right fix. Either we should make BufferedDataBlockEncoder public or make the 4 classes referring it private. Since the 4 classes are being referred from within .../io/encoding only, and are implementations of what public DataBlockEncoding enum exposes, they don't really need to be public. So I think this would be the most appropriate thing to do.

OK, in that case I am not sure what is next. :)

This patch makes the 4 classes private. When I ran mvn clean package locally, it failed a test but I think it is unrelated:

{code}
Failed tests:   testSingleMember(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.procedure.TestZKProcedure): (..)

Tests run: 932, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 2
{code}

yeah, the test is a flaky. patch looks good to me
