Currently I see the {{getVersion}} implementation in the metastore is returning a hard-coded "3.0". It would be good to return the real version of the metastore server using {{HiveversionInfo}} so that clients can take certain actions based on metastore server versions.

Possible use-cases are:
1. Client A can make use of new features introduced in given Metastore version else stick to the base functionality.
2. This version number  can be used to do a version handshake between client and server in the future to improve our cross-version compatibity story.
