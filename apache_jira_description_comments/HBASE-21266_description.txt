Found during ITBLL testing. AM in master gets into a state where manual attempts from the shell to run the balancer always return false and this is printed in the master log:

2018-10-03 19:17:14,892 DEBUG [RpcServer.default.FPBQ.Fifo.handler=21,queue=0,port=8100] master.HMaster: Not running balancer because processing dead regionserver(s): 

Note the empty list. 

This errant state did not recover without intervention by way of master restart, but the test environment was chaotic so needs investigation.
