Looks like the cassandra.pid file was never created. Failure happens in _update_pid(), when trying to get the pid from cassandra.pid. Possibly a bug, [~philipthompson]?

I suppose so. The node fails to start after an upgrade from 2.1 to 3.0.8. It seems very flaky, and literally nothing useful is in the logs, so I don't expect anyone to make it very far with this, but it's not a clear test issue.

Hey, this doesnt have a known failure for some reason? Also, are you working on this still
