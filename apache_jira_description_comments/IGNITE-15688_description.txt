IgniteClient interface currently doesn't override close() from AutoClosable. Because of that, it inherits `close() throws Exception` forcing all users to catch Exception when using IgniteClient.

 

In fact, this shouldn't be required. `TcpIgniteClient implements IgniteClient` currently throws Exception but it doesn't need to - its code doesn't throw any checked exceptions.

 

Proposal:
 # Add `@Overrides public void close()` with no `throws` to IgniteClient.
 # Remove `throws Exception` from `TcpIgniteClient::close`

Note: this change is fully backwards-compatible. It is legal to narrow the scope of `throws` in a new version of a method.
