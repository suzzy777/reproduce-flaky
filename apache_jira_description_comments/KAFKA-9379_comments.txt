URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7917
 
 
   Test creates a topic, waits for `adminClient.listTopics` to return the topic and then performs `alterTopic()`, which also uses `adminClient.listTopics` to verify that the topic exists. This may fail if the topic hadn't yet been propagated to the broker to which the second `listTopics` is sent. This PR updates the test to wait for topic to be in the metadata cache of all brokers before calling `alterTopic()`.
