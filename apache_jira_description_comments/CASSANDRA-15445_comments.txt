[patch|https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commits/marcuse/15445] [tests|https://circleci.com/workflow-run/df31ff0f-a405-4506-a99c-f6c0b19f99df]

+1. LGTM. The unit tests failures look unrelated and likely flaky. It could be worth running the jdk11 tests as well. One minor suggestion, totally optional: for future readers, it might be nice to have some comments in {{testDisableSTCSInL0}}. E.g. "setup some sstables in L1 that should be the first compaction candidates after STCS in L0 is disabled" and "create a bunch of sstables in L0 so it looks behind". 

 

 

Committed with a comment added, thanks
