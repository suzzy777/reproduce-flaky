Besides above build, is there any build that this test fails too?

No idea, I've seen it only in PR builder and thought file it to help others.

Tested it on my local machine in a loop and never appeared.

I have not noticed the evidence that this test is flaky for now. Maybe we can close this and you can always reopen it if this is really an issue.

I'm fine to close this and reopen if comes more often. Closing...

Thanks for taking a look at it.

I'm reopening this because this is a real flakiniess issue.
