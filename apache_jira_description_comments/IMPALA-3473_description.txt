Casey, I picked you thinking you might have an idea whatâ€™s going on here; feel free to find another person or assign back to me if you're swamped.

I've only seen this fail once, I couldn't reproduce it locally and other GVMs don't seem to be affected. Here's the error message pointing to the test in question ({{be/src/exec/kudu-table-sink-test.cc:264}}):

{noformat}
Value of: skip_val == 1 ? expected_num_rows : (expected_num_rows + 1) / skip_val
  Actual: 20
Expected: row_idx
Which is: 10
