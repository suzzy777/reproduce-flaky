Currently impossible to return full index range with existing IndexQuery criteria. There are  workarounds like `lte(Integer.MAX_VALUE)`. But it will be much better enable index scan by default if not criteria set. It's useful by reasons:
 # In some cases IndexQuery is faster then ScanQuery. Then IndexQuery should have same API as ScanQuery for such cases - new IndexQuery(tbl, idxName)
 # IndexQuery criteria performs AND operation. There is no way to set OR. setFilter is only way to specify custom rule non-AND rule for IndexQuery. So we need allow to use only filter without any criteria.

 

If index name isn't specified then IndexQuery should take PK index of specified table.
