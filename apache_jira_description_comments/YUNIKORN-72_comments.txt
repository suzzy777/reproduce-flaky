The data race is logged because we update the configuration pointer we store. This is a test only issue. The pointer is created in {{init}}Â and we update it in {{Set}}. We should change {{Set}} into an update call and replace the values that need to be replaced in the original created configuration.

We should treat the pointer to the config as a non changing value. Passing the struct around by value (not a pointer) is not an option as the struct is large.
