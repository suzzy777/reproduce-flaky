Region state transitions do not work correctly for READY_TO_MERGE/SPLIT.  [~thiruvel] and I noticed this is due to break statements being in the wrong place in AssignmentManager.  This allows a race condition for example in which one of the regions being merged could be moved concurrently, resulting in the merge transaction failing and then double assignment and/or dataloss.  This bug appears to only affect branch-1 (for example 1.3 and 1.4) and not branch-2 as the relevant code in AM has since been rewritten.
