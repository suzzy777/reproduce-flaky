As mentioned in [FLUME-2309|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-2309], the directory listing can it self become the bottleneck when accessing directories with a large number of files (>1M). The fix in that JIRA added in the ability to specify `RANDOM` as a Consume-Order to avoid sorting large lists.

The slowness of the directory listing is still un-addressed.
