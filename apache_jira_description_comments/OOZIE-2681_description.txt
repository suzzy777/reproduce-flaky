We have a lot of Javadoc build failures, which causes Oozie to fail to build on Java 8, which is more strict than Java 6 or 7 was.  OOZIE-2178 fixed all of these that existed at that time, but we've since introduced a lot more.  OOZIE-2487 made a workaround to prevent this from causing the build to fail, but we should fix these (again) and remove the OOZIE-2487 workaround.
