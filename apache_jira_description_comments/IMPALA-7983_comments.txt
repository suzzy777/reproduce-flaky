[~tarmstrong] Looks like a flaky test to me. Just happened once. Another exhaustive/centos6 build is running as I write this comment. I tried looking at the system logs and the process logs, couldn't find anything interesting. Assigning this to you since you might have some context here. Feel free to reassign if you are busy.

The most likely explanation is that there was actually some data corruption and the integrity check caught it as intended. I'll think about what else could have happened or how we could try to reproduce it.

The other alternative is that it's a product bug. This shouldn't happen in normal operation.

I turned on disk spill encryption by default 7 months ago - https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/10345/. I don't think anything else in this code has changed substantially since then, so we've running this a *lot* of times already without seeing this error.  I think the main thing we could do is loop this test on an identical VM and see if it reproduces.

I looped the test since Friday (3 days) on a CentOS 6 VM, similar to where we saw the failure. I had stress running in the background to try to reproduce any races. I wasn't able to reproduce anything similar.

Unassigning because I don't have plans to investigate further. I had reached the conclusion that it was unlikely to be a bug in Impala, rather a bug lower in the stack that we're catching by checksumming all the data we're reading and writing.

This was pretty clearly associated with centos 6 and an older AMI. We haven't seen it since we stopped using those.
