oozie process always  consume  high cpu. in my mechine,around 10%. 

I check the source code，find take() method in PriorityDelayQueue class。

code:
{code:java}
public QueueElement<E> take() throws InterruptedException {
    QueueElement<E> e = poll();
    while (e == null) {
        Thread.sleep(10);
        e = poll();
    }
    return e;
}
{code}



i think it's the reason of this problem. it's keep while, not await.
