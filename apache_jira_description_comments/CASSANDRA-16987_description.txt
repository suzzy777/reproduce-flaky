The `is_supported_version()` function performs a lexicographical comparison between the Python version number in the format of `MAJOR.MINOR` with `3.6`. This works as expected if the Python version number is between `3.0` and `3.9` (inclusive), but will produce an unexpected result if the Python version number is `3.10` or above.

Recommended fix is to split the version number into two integers, `$version_major` and `$version_minor` and then compare them to `3` and `6` respectively.
