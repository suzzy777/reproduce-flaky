Review tests currently disabled (+ than 50). These components seem to have a large number of disabled tests: 
* -camel-zendesk-: auto-generated test (OK)
* -camel-twillio-: auto-generated test (OK)
* -camel-joor-: done (also: CAMEL-19681)
* -camel-box-: semi-automated tests
* -camel-braintree-: semi-automated tests
* -camel-web3j-: semi automated tests.
* -camel-fhir-: flaky tests (OK)

These are probably OK, but they may be missing the disabled reason or are auto-generated tests or require external system access (i.e.: semi-automated tests).
