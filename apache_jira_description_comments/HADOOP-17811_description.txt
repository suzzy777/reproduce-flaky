The ABFS driver uses ExponentialRetryPolicy to handle throttling by the ADLS Gen 2 API. The number of retries can already be configured by setting the propertyÂ fs.azure.io.retry.max.retries. However, none of the other properties on ExponentialRetryPolicy can be set even though configuration properties have already been defined for them. Allow the additional properties (min/max retry wait, default wait) to be configured.
