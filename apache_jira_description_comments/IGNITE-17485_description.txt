Move Apache Ignite to Gradle as second build system.

*IMPORTANT: Maven build should NOT remove in context of this ticket and should stay as default build system.*

# Create gradle modules with similar structure as Maven and write build scripts.
#  All target artifacts should be same as maven. (check-rules/maven-check-scripts content should be also applied, but better to use plugins instead of binary scripts).
# All style checks and code quality checks should be not changed in gradle build.
# Target Gradle version 7.
# Build process should be unified for Linux and Windows OS.
