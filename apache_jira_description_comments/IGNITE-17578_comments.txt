I muted distributed implementations of testBalance under the ticket about tx commands reordering ( IGNITE-20116 ) because sometimes tx update commands go ahead of tx cleanup, assuming they have greater safe time. I also made multiple TC runs to make sure that no other tests have become flaky after these changes.
