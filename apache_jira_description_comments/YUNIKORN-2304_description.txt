The flaky is hard to be dig-in since it fails rarely. Hence, it would be better to have an example of looping specify flaky in our docs. That can be one-line command. For instance:
{code:java}
I=0; while go test -run TestNoFillWithoutEventPluginRegistered ./pkg/... -count=1; do (( I=$I+1 )); echo "Completed loop: $I"; sleep 1; done {code}
