What project is throwing that error? The test jar is generated in {{flink-runtime}} in the usual way.
I see you are using a maven server, maybe that is the issue.

What other problem occur when compiling Flink? Most people compile it well with default settings (including the flaky Travis CI service).
Could be a problem of your setup.

Today [~fhueske] and me also have problems in compiling {{flink-table}}. Maybe it is just a Maven central issue. Or have we changed Maven dependencies recently?

My local nexus proxy is something wrong.
