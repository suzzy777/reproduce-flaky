I instrumented the SparkSinkSuite earlier to be more deterministic. I will do the same for this one tomorrow.

Could you actually merge the two Flume stream suites so that we reduce code
duplication and also reduce setup times for test harnesses (setup once test
all stream and polling streams).



Perhaps in a separate patch? I will open a PR to fix this first since this is a blocker, and then open a separate PR to merge the two.

Makes sense. Thanks!
