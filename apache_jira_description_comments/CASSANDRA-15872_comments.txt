[patch|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/630/files]: the test is flaky when repair task executor executes the job before the assertion. the fix is to put a latch.  cc [~maedhroz]

[~maedhroz][~bdeggleston] Either of you guys want to have a look? A small patch.

I can probably take a look this week.

[~jasonstack] It looks like the fix should address the race between {{SyncTask}} completion and the assertion, but I think we can do this without modifying {{RepairJob}}. One alternative is that we could take {{MeasureableRepairSession}}, provide it a callback (perhaps allow it to be set int the test body), override {{syncComplete()}}, and hit the callback from that before we call {{super.syncComplete()}}. That would allow us to await on a latch in there or even directly make the assertion. (My assumption is that there will be at least one remote job.)

Making the test a bit more complex while simplifying the production code seems reasonable here. Thoughts?

bq. One alternative is that we could take MeasureableRepairSession, provide it a callback (perhaps allow it to be set int the test body), override syncComplete(), and hit the callback from that before we call super.syncComplete()

good idea. updated the patch to put a latch on the "MeasureableRepairSession" callback.

+1
