test failures are unrelated to the patch. accumulo_index.q and accumulo_index.q are already failing in master. skewjoinopt1.q passes locally for me which is probably flaky. I will trigger another test run to make sure anyways.

LGTM +1. Some smaller questions:

- Is SESSIONS_PER_DEFAULT_QUEUE guaranteed to be >= 1?

- Does it make sense to add range validators for the new settings (0, 1.0)?

bq. Is SESSIONS_PER_DEFAULT_QUEUE guaranteed to be >= 1?

The default value is 1 but it doesn't guard against values set by user. In .3 patch added guard against <=0 values and a unit test for the same.

 bq. Does it make sense to add range validators for the new settings (0, 1.0)?

.1 patch had RangeValidator but then I removed it as >1.0 values are also valid. Something like 120% oversubscription is a valid scenario. However under subscription is not allowed and is guarded by the return value
{code}
return Math.max(maxSize, llapMaxSize);
{code}
where maxSize is the initial no conditional task size.

Fixes the new test failure. 

dynamic_semijoin_user_level.q is failing already in master (tracked in HIVE-16540) and not related to this patch. 

Committed to master. Thanks for the reviews Gunther!

Doc note:  This adds two configs (*hive.llap.mapjoin.memory.oversubscribe.factor* and *hive.llap.memory.oversubscription.max.executors.per.query*) to HiveConf.java, so they need to be documented in the wiki.

* [Configuration Properties -- LLAP | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-LLAP]

Added a TODOC3.0 label.

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
