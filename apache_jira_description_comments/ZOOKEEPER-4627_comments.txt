Would love to see this PR merged and a build created ASAP.

I have committed this to master, branch-3.8 and branch-3.7. Mate already covered branch-3.6 in PR [#1957|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/1957] in preparation for the 3.6.4 release.

[~mdobozy] , thank you for the contribution. [~ghatage] , thank you for your work on the prior [#1941|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/1941]. (I gave you co-author credit on this one.) Thank you also to [~symat] for the additional review.

[~cnauroth] Happy to help. Just for my planning purposes, when should we expect a new 3.8 release that includes this fix to go out?

Hi [~mdobozy]. I don't think the community has set any specific timeline for a new 3.8 release yet. I recommend watching the dev@zookeeper.apache.org mailing list for news, similar to the recent discussion of 3.6.4 release planning:
