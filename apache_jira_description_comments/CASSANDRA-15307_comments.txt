Output of running it 50 times locally on trunk attached. 

 

After checking the initial implementation at CASSANDRA-12403, the fix at CASSANDRA-13050, and inspecting the logs - I changed Dcassandra.test.read_iteration_delay_ms to 2 milliseconds and it looks like this solves the flakiness also for v4 (it was already solved for 3.11 In CASSANDRA-13050).

Preliminary testing of 50 runs shows 100% success rate.

I will run it 300 times tonight to ensure the fix is stable.  

 

300 runs completed successfully. Attached is the output.

There are a couple of tests that show longer completion as my laptop fell asleep.
