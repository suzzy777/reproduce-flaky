IMPALA-6704: Skip config validations in session-expiry-test.

Just like expr-test, we can skip config checking when creating
the InProcessImpalaServer in session-expiry-test. This fixes
an issue where the test would fail when there is no minicluster.
(The test itself would actually race and only fail sometimes,
on some machines.)

Testing: ran session-expiry-test.
