Oh.... the TestAssignmentManagerMetrics was always flaky during the past 6 days ... Will take a look for this.. 

this is still failing on branch-2, branch-2.0, and master. you still taking a look [~openinx]?

OK,  will dig this today,  Thanks [~busbey] for reminding :-) 

I believe that it's a race problem.   I found that a region was in transition, but also was failed open status.   So the RIT_COUNT would be 2. 



Got it,  see RegionTransitionProcedure#execute(), at #1,  we add the region in to regionInTransition map,  and at #2,  the remote call  failed, we'll put the region into regionFailedOpen map,  then retries 10 times,  after the retry finished,  we'll remote the region from regionInTransition map.  if we check the RIT_COUNT_NAME when  retrying,  then the RIT_COUNT will be 2. 
{code}
if (!am.addRegionInTransition(regionNode, this)) {          //  #1
   ....
}
case REGION_TRANSITION_DISPATCH:
            // 2. send the request to the target server
            if (!updateTransition(env, regionNode)) {            //  #2
                // .... 
            }
{code}



[~chia7712], Mind you help review ? 

+1, I'm fine with changing the comment on commit.

+1 on commit to branch-2.0 too (Agree w/ Peter... can fix comment on commit).

+1

Pushed to master/branch-2/branch-2.0, Thanks all for reviewing.  Keep this issue open to see what flaky dashboard will say..

Not flaky any more, close this issue.
