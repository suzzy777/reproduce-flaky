In discussion of HBASE-4552 / HBASE-4677 there has been some discussion about whether and how to backport HBASE-4552 to the 0.90 branch.  This is a potentially compatibility breaking so several approaches hav ebeen suggested.

1) provide patch but do not integrate
2) integrate patch that extends and deprecates old api without removing old api.  It has been argued that  clients are supposed to use LoadIncrementalHFiles api and not at the internal HRegionServer RPC api.
