[Patch|https://github.com/belliottsmith/cassandra/tree/16934-trunk]

CI continues to be generally unreliable, however my most recent run of [trunk|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/belliottsmith/cassandra/148/workflows/55ac8b17-d828-4a4a-ae1d-064048e5a397] conveniently matches the most recent set of failures for [this patch|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/belliottsmith/cassandra/164/workflows/08fcf48d-d1e0-47a0-9a69-e5eb672b1ed0] except for {{test_bootstrap_with_reset_bootstrap_state}} which appears to be flaky and has an associated Jira.
