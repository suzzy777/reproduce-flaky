I would like to propose integration of [JaCoCo|http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/] coverage library with ZooKeeper.

h4. Purposes
 - To find poorly covered methods, and improve JUnit testcases to cover them
 - To estimate causes of flaky testcases (e.g. ZOOKEEPER-2080, ZOOKEEPER-2252, ZOOKEEPER-1868) by comparing reports from succeeded experiments and failed ones (I'm recently interested in how we can systematically realize this.)

h4. Advantages of JaCoCo
 - Support recent JDKs (including JDK 8)
 - Low overhead
 - Released under EPL
 -- Note: cobertura has been removed from the code base because it is released under GPL ( ZOOKEEPER-75, http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x )


h4. Usage
{panel}
$ ant test #(plus optionally, -Dtestcase=.. -Dtest.method=..)
$ ant jacoco-report
$ x-www-browser build/test/jacoco/reports/index.html &
{panel}
Example: jacoco-report-example.zip

h4. Possible Future Work
- Integrate to Jenkins buildbot so that we can check coverage after each of builds
