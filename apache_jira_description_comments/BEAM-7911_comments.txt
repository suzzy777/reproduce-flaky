Looks like the test is expecting an exception but it isn't always raised.
1. There's a bug in checking for the exception's text. (the AttributeError above)
2. There's a flake where the exception isn't always raised.


I figured it out. It's a python 3 issue. type(data[last_char_index]) is str in py2 vs int in py3, so it'll never match b'B' in py3.
