ClientServerCompatibilityTest fails for two reasons:

1. {{Failed to establish Ignite thin client connection, examine inner exceptions for details. (Connection refused 127.0.0.1:10892)}} - check process output, is there a different port used for the client connector?

2. {{GridUnsafe cannot access class jdk.internal.misc.SharedSecrets}} - we should pass {{--add-exports}} and {{--illegal-access=permit}} JVM options when running on Java9+, see {{Jvm.IsJava9}}.
