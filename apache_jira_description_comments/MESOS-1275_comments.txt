Is this a failure? Or is it enough to set an expectation on the {{offerRescinded}} mock method?

Likely the expectation is enough. Only one way to find out ... repeat a few thousand times :) 

it seems that we don't expect this to be called as we're not actually failing over the Master and the slave isn't checkpointing. I added an expectation for 0 calls to the offerRescinded method (https://reviews.apache.org/r/21819) and ran over 2000 repetitions of the test. I can't reproduce it.

Is it possible this is some interaction with other tests being run or a different order of tests?

The warning above tells that offerRescinded was called when we don't expect it. We don't have to explicitly set .Times(0) expectations for things we are not interested in. I suspect this was fixed with one of Adam's recent patches around slave disconnection. Lets mark it resolved for now (also drop the review) and re-open it if we see this again.

Agreed that this is probably related to my recent slave disconnection patch(es), since we were at one point (after Apr 25) rescinding offers when a slave tried to reregister (re-authenticate actually), which is what this test was doing. This behavior was fixed on May 2nd, but not before this flaky test appeared on April 30th. Timing matches up.
