If IGNITE_LOG_CLASSPATH_CONTENT_ON_STARTUP is enabled, IgniteKernel#ackClassPathContent parses the classpath and recursively  traverses the file system printing all jars and class files.
Traversing the files system could take much time in case of many class files or having a root folder in the classpath. 
The reasonable behavior is  to print only root classpath folders.
