Proposed fix is here:

I was wrong about this change.Â {{Socket.getInputStream().available)}} still works in jdk13 and beyond, however it doesn't report received data as quickly as before. This means fast networks may still encounter hangs when servers don't drain request bytes, but in most cases the buffers are large enough that responses are still detected. My test was run locally using a loopback interface where {{stream.available()}} never produced a nonzero value in time.
