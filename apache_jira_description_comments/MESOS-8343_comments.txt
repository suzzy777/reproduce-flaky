    Fixed flaky test `SchedulerHttpApiTest.UpdatePidToHttpScheduler`.
    
    The test was flaky due to a race between scheduler driver stopping
    during test teardown and the scheduler `error()` invocation.
    Adding the missing synchronization for the expectation should
    eliminate the race.
