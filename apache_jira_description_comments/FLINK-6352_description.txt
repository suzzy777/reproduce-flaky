    Currently "auto.offset.reset" is used to initialize the start offset of FlinkKafkaConsumer, and the value should be earliest/latest/none. This method can only let the job comsume the beginning or the most recent data, but can not specify the specific offset of Kafka began to consume. 
    So, there should be a configuration item (such as "flink.source.start.time" and the format is "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss") that allows user to configure the initial offset of Kafka. The action of "flink.source.start.time" is as follows:
1) job start from checkpoint / savepoint
  a> offset of partition can be restored from checkpoint/savepoint,  "flink.source.start.time" will be ignored.
  b> there's no checkpoint/savepoint for the partition (For example, this partition is newly increased), the "flink.kafka.start.time" will be used to initialize the offset of the partition    
2) job has no checkpoint / savepoint, the "flink.source.start.time" is used to initialize the offset of the kafka
  a> the "flink.source.start.time" is valid, use it to set the offset of kafka
  b> the "flink.source.start.time" is out-of-range, the same as it does currently with no initial offset, get kafka's current offset and start reading
