the test depends on hard coded cassandra version and the order in which keyspaces/datacenters are listed, this should fix those things;

https://circleci.com/workflow-run/6c0f0d61-3b5c-49dd-bdeb-22d24dc60b15

it also reduces the number of nodes started to 4 since starting 6 nodes is likely to fail in circle ci

[~jay.zhuang] or [~jasobrown] do either of you have time to review?

I'm unable to reproduce the problem locally, for the failed job in Jenkins, seems mostly it's because timeout to populate 6 nodes:

Other tests which requires 6 nodes all marked as {{@pytest.mark.resource_intensive}} (then these tests are skipped). I think reducing the node number from 6 to 4 should help.

+1 for the patch (also it passed 100 times locally run).
