In CDH 6.x, on the Hadoop 3 rebase, it is now a failure if items are added multiple times to the distributed cache. In CDH5, this was a warning. This is not an issue for most uses, as adding multiple times typically is user error, but this completely breaks Spark actions with keytabs (--keytab).

Oozie spark actions add everything in the distributed cache of the launcher job to the distributed cache of the spark job, meaning the keytab is already there, then the --keytab argument tries to add it again causing the failure [0].
