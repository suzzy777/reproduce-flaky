We need httpclient & httpcore jars to be present when rootdir is placed on s3(a).
Attempts to move to the fully shaded amazon-SDK JAR caused problems of its own. (according to [~steve_l])

Here are the versions we should use:

<commons.httpclient.version>4.5.2</commons.httpclient.version>
<commons.httpcore.version>4.4.4</commons.httpcore.version>

Currently they are declared test dependency.

This JIRA is to move to compile time dependency so that the corresponding jars are bundled in lib directory.
