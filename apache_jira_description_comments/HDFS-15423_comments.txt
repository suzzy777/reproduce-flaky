[~csun] I will work on this one.

[~csun] [~elgoiri] [~hexiaoqiao] Please review the PR. Thanks!

Thanks [~fengnanli] for the improvement.
Merged PR 2605.

Thanks [~elgoiri] [~ayushtkn] for the review! Let's see whether it can fix [HDFS-15878|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-15878]

Hi compile fails on trunk. Maybe it's related to this.

RouterWebHdfsMethods#chooseDatanode
{code:java}
resolvedNs = rpcServer.getCreateLocation(path).getNameserviceId();
{code}
But getCreateLocation is defined as this, it is used with wrong arguments.
{code:java}

RemoteLocation getCreateLocation(
    final String src, final List<RemoteLocation> locations)
    throws IOException {
...
}{code}

I reverted the merge.
[~fengnanli] do you mind creating a new PR fixing the compilation issue?
I'm curious on why Yetus didn't catch this.

[~elgoiri] Sure, I will create a new one.

[~elgoiri] [~ferhui] The dependent call was removed in this task: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-15884. Can we revert that?

Unfortunate timing...
I asked there to see if we should revert it but it might be faster for us to just add it in this PR.

Indeed. Let's wait for one day since by reverting the history would be cleaner...

I have reverted HDFS-15884, Was part of both these jiras and didn't realise one is gonna break another. Need to work on my memory. :)

[~fengnanli] can you raise a new PR

Thanks very much [~ayushtkn] I have opened: [https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2903] for it.

Merged PR 2903.
The build seemed to succeed a few hours ago.
