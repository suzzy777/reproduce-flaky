These look like great changes N.

On IT stuff, thats HBASE-6302

bq. => We should be able to use categories in all modules. The default should be small; but any test manipulating the time needs to be in a specific jvm (hence medium), so it's not always related to minicluster.
Right now, the only exception is hadoop-compat modules. 
See Elliot's comment: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-7109?focusedCommentId=13503984&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13503984
bq. => Add a chapter on flakiness.
+1.
bq. => We could actually activate the localTests profile whenever -Dtest is used. If we do that, we can remove the reference from localTests in the doc.
+1. -PlocalTets is not intuitive, and I was burned a couple of times by this. By having active in profile, this should be easy to do. 
bq. => Integration tests are described TODO: POINTER_TO_INTEGRATION_TEST_SECTION
We can just commit HBASE-6302. 


I happened to work on the issue a little bit and attached my patch to the issue. Inside the patch, there are following changes:

bq. => We could actually activate the localTests profile whenever -Dtest is used. If we do that, we can remove the reference from localTests in the doc.

Trigger localTest profile whenever "-Dtest" is specified so we can run individual tests like "mvm test â€“Dtest=MyTest" without specifying "localTests" profile. In addition, adding a note to let users pay attention on the number of "Tests run" because no error is reported when non-existent test cases are specified.

bq. => Integration tests are described TODO: POINTER_TO_INTEGRATION_TEST_SECTION

Instantiate "TODO: POINTER_TO_INTEGRATION_TEST_SECTION" with the right link

Change class name HBaseIntegrationTestingUtility to IntegrationTestingUtility because HBaseIntegrationTestingUtility doesn't exist at all.

I will commit Jeffrey's patch tomorrow if there is no objection.

Committed. Thanks, Jeffrey!
I removed as well a reference to localTests in zookeeper.xml.

Our last issue (SUREFIRE-800) is now tagged as fixed in the next (2.13) surefire release, so I'm going to be optimistic and wait for it before updating the remaining part...

It looks like this issue was resolved but never closed. Ping [~nkeywal], [~jeffreyz].

Actually, I'm waiting for 4955 to finish this one.



OK, 4995 is closed so I will close this JIRA too.

Closing this issue after 0.99.2 release.
