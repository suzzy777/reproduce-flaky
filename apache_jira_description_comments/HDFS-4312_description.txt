TestSecureNameNode does not work on Java6 without "dfs.web.authentication.kerberos.principal" config property set.

Also the following improved:
1) keytab files are checked for existence and readability to provide fast-fail on config error.
2) added comment to TestSecureNameNode describing the required sys props.
3) string literals replaced with config constants.
