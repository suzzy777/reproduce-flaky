Currently the list of admin users is defined in the {{adminusers.txt}} file hard coded to the Oozie config dir. For a more streamlined solution, we could define the list of admin users via {{oozie-site.xml}} by introducing the following configuration, which receives the comma separated values of the users that are admins.

{{oozie.service.AuthorizationService.admin.users}}
