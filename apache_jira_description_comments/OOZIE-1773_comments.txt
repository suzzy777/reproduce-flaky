have you double-checked that the query does not include the times clause before this change? I remember thinking it does, but I could've been mistaken.

also can you add a unit test for start and end nominaltime for sake of completeness?

it does include before, but parameters (time related part) in query were not substituted properly except for bundle ID

added startscheduledtime/endscheduledtime  in testcase
