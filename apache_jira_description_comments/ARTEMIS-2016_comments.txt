    ARTEMIS-2016 fix flaky test QueueControlTest#testRemoveAllWithPagingMode

    Parameters going into Wait.waitFor were originally wrong, because
    `durationMillis: 3, sleepMillis: 100` means you would test the condition
    only once. This commit is changing the durationMillis from 3ms to 3s,
    swapping the two numbers (duration 100ms, sleep 3ms) would also be reasonable, I think.
    
    Next, Wait.assertEquals is here being used, instead of Assert.assertTrue.
    
    I saw the test fail only once, and never was able to reproduce it again,
    but I think this commit does improve the test and so it is worthwhile.

(cherry picked from commit c1a191c547c0fb8e0bce4f17751e356b213f1ddb)


The {{org.apache.activemq.artemis.tests.integration.management.QueueControlTest#assertMetrics}} has been fixed.

The zero timeout in {{org.apache.activemq.artemis.tests.integration.clientcrash.ClientTestBase#assertActiveConnections(int)}} and {{org.apache.activemq.artemis.tests.integration.clientcrash.ClientTestBase#assertActiveSession(int)}} was not yet fixed. edit: because I don't know what to do with it.

I thought about this again and I now think the zero timeout is perfectly ok value (since the test works with it just fine, so why make it longer, right). Thanks.
