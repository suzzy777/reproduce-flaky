@Ted, could you please give this patch a try on your MacBook?  I could not reproduce the failure on my box.
I looked into the code carefully and this fix should make this testcase not flaky any more.

Nice find. +1 on patch.

I propose this patch based on Jimmy's where Thread is set as Daemon.

I looped TestReplication#queueFailover 5 times using both 5112-v2.txt and 5099.92 - no error

I am looping TestReplication itself 5 more times.

Will integrate both 5112 and 5099 if there is no error.

Thanks for the New Year present, Jimmy.

+1 on v2

Integrated to 0.92 and TRUNK.

Thanks for the patch, Jimmy.

Thanks for the review, Lars.
