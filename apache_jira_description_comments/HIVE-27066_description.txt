These tests are flaky due to Total Size in the query output.
The test is recently committed, and is around MV's in iceberg. It missed 


{noformat}
--! qt:replace:/(\s+totalSize\s+)\S+(\s+)/$1#Masked#$2/ 
{noformat}

Which is done in most of the tests adding totalSize in the query output to avoid flakiness
