Dear,

The VirtualSelectorCacheBrokerPlugin throws an error in the following method:
{code:java}
if (!(desc.getName().equals("java.lang.String") || desc.getName().startsWith("java.util."))) {
 throw new InvalidClassException("Unauthorized deserialization attempt", desc.getName());
 }
{code}
This exception is thrown because there are some lines in the selector cache file that do not match the given "startsWith("java.util.")". The code will throw an exception because of the "[L" prefix in front of some java.util. elements in the file:

My activemq.xml and file.data are attached to this ticket.

The selector cache is working fine if I use ActiveMQ version 5.15.11 or below.

I have tried to add jdk.serialFilters for the Concurrent Hashmap, like:

wrapper.java.additional.13=-Djdk.serialFilter=java.util.** (wrapper.conf) and also tried to add this to the java security file, but that did not work.

I hope this issue can be fixed or if it is not a bug, the documentation can be complemented with some notes on how to configure this filters the right way.

Best regards,

Joost
