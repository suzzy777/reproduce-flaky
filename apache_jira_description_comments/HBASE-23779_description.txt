Tests take a long time. Our fork count running all tests are conservative -- 1 (small) for first part and 5 for second part (medium and large). Rather than hardcoding we should set the fork count to be relative to machine size. Suggestion here is 0.75C where C is CPU count. This ups the CPU use on my box.

Looking up at jenkins, it seems like the boxes are 24 cores... at least going by my random survey. The load reported on a few seems low though this not representative (looking at machine/uptime).

More parallelism willl probably mean more test failure. Let me take a look see.
