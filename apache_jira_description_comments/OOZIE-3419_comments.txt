Thank you [~andras.piros]!

One note: In case we have an improper Java version (< 1.8.0_u40), and the png generation is skipped, I would add a warning log message.

 

Thanks [~andras.piros] , [~kmarton]I also think that a warning message could be useful here.

[~kmarton] [~asalamon74] added log messages.

After this commit it's no longer possible to compile Oozie without turning off checkstyle checking:

The [commit|https://github.com/apache/oozie/commit/96fcb401f81e1aaee3c3de41e77916af95b0e378#diff-65117e05229a1aa9618b6b13c9482667] changed line 9-11 of {{GraphVisualization.java}} but [checkstyle-header.txt|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/fluent-job/fluent-job-api/src/main/resources/checkstyle-header.txt] of fluent-job still requires the old style.

We should either create an amend commit which changes back the lines to the style, or we should update checkstyle-header.txt of fluent-job and also update all the source files to the new style.

[~andras.piros], reopened the issue because of the checkstyle problem.

Uploaded an amend patch which makes it possible to compile Oozie without turning off the checkstyle checking.

Thank you [~asalamon74] for the amend patch! +1

committed to master

Closing issue; Oozie 5.2.0 is released
