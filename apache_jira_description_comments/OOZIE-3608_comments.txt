This changes the logic and also amends the WARN to wrap the timezone in brackets.

This makes it easier to see erroneous whitespace.

The Jenkins run was aborted but this can't be due to this patch as it'll only affect a log message.

It timed out.

Thanks for the patch [~larsfrancke]! I'll use this ticket to test out the migration of our precommit testing to the new ASF Jenkins :)
To compensate for the possible spam from Jenkins, I'll do a review of your patch. :)


Thanks! I'll happily take that deal ;)

+1, this run is green :)

Committed to master!
Thanks for the contribution [~larsfrancke]!

Thank you [~gezapeti]!

I'm not sure if I'm missing something though but I don't see a commit for this in master?

It's there, I've just messed up the commit message: https://github.com/apache/oozie/commit/34b87e1ed8d22315da57acdd108873935c879826

We don't force push master, so it'll be like this forever. :( I'm sorry, I'll make sure your next contribution's message will be correct :)

Ah, no worries, as long as the code is there I don't mind.

Commit 7bcd9819dd825dc906f03978cd4e967c75d108b0 in oozie's branch refs/heads/master from Gezapeti Cseh
