    CB-10632: Fixing jasmine test contact removal

    This is related to the flaky tests that have been failing in the android-win CI. As the jasmine tests execute, they create contacts and occasionally fail to remove them. When that happens, the created contacts will never be removed and all of the tests that depend on those contacts not existing will fail until someone manually deletes the contacts on the emulator. This PR does not fix the test flakiness issue, but does fix the issue of the tests being permanently broken by a single failure. It also makes it so that the removal failures will actually be reported by jasmine where they were not previously so that we can hopefully pinpoint the real issue and fix the flaky test in a later PR.
