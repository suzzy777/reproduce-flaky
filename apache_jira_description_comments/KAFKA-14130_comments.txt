Hi, I am new to Kafka and noticed that this issue is tagged as newbie. 

I found that there is already have {{{}RackAwarenessStreamsPartitionAssignorTest{}}}.


Has this issue been resolved?

Hello [~guozhang] there is no RackAwarenessIntegrationTest Class existingÂ 

Hello [~hoping][~Eslam.hamdy] sorry about the confusion.. I have complete this ticket myself through this PR: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12476. I forgot to close this ticket though, which is my bad.. closing now.

Thank you [~guozhang] and good Job! :)
