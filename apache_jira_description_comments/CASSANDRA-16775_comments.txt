The primary aim of this patch was to reduce the logging level from ERROR to WARN for a number of exceptions that distract from the root causes of repair/validation failures. Along the way, i.e. while writing and debugging the new {{RepairErrorsTest}}, I discovered that we don't properly release off-heap Merkle trees through remote validation errors. To make sure that the new tests aren't flaky out of the box, I went ahead and fixed that as well.
