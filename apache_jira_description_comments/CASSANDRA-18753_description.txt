We currently offer only one sample configuration file with Cassandra, and that file is deliberately configured to disable all new functionality and incompatible improvements. This works well for legacy users that want to have a painless upgrade, but is a very bad choice for new users, or anyone wanting to make comparisons between Cassandra versions or between Cassandra and other databases.

We offer very little indication, in the database packaging itself, that there are well-tested configuration choices that can solve known problems and dramatically improve performance. This is guaranteed to paint the database in a worse light than it deserves, and will very likely hurt adoption.

We should find a way to offer a very easy way of choosing between "optimized" and "compatible" defaults. At minimal, we could provide alternate yaml files. Alternatively, we could build on the {{storage_compatibility_mode}} concept to grow it into a setting that not only enables/disables certain settings, but also changes their default values.
