This issue can have many different manifestations but you can grep you locator and server logs for "Allocating larger network read buffer". If you see that info message then you are at risk of having some type of inconsistency in your geode cluster.
The workaround for this issue is to set "socket-buffer-size" the same on all the members of your cluster (both servers and locators).

GEODE-9825: processInputBuffer resize retains data (#7131)



Merged to {{{}develop{}}}. Back-port PR to 1.14 is ready to merge. A flaky test failed in the PR for 1.13 (wrote a new ticket GEODE-9850 and re-initiated the test).

Back-port to 1.12 has a problem. I had to back-port the PR for GEODE-9713 (test framework enhancement). Unfortunately it relies on a newer version (4.1.0) of Awaitility (was at 3.1.6). Bumping just that version in DependencyConstraints.groovy was not sufficient as something (TBD) is dependent on Awaitility 2.0.0 and that version is taking precedence. I want to work this out and then merge all three PRs together (in close succession).
