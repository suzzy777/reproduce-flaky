The current Cassandra source sink is tightly coupled to the Datastax Object Mapper. [This requires users|https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/3.1/manual/object_mapper/] of the sink to provide a POJO describing  the table in Cassandra. Although the POJO is a easy and powerful way to describe the table it does requires users to always recompile the pipeline for each change in the table definition. 

I suggest adding a abstraction layer that allows users to inject their own mapper implementation. One example use would be a mapper that works with a generic [Row|https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.4.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/values/Row.html] implementation rather than a compile-time POJO. 

This abstraction layer could be implemented by simply supplying a MapperFactory through the Sink/Source builder.
