bq. This ticket is on hold until the ASF legal clears up its policy, and the project confirms the approach it wants to take with {{lib/}} dependencies. 

The ASF updated the [policy|https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#source-packages], to state: _A source release SHOULD not contain compiled code_.

Feedback to the current approach has been positive, particularly to the way it simplifies (and strengthens) the way the dependencies are declared and packaged.

(back-ported commits kept individual for review readability, they will be squashed) 


Because the ASF policy has been clarified as not strictly enforcing against compiled code or dependencies in the source artefact, back-porting to 2.2 has been dropped (as it is going into critical-fix only mode as soon as 4.0.0 is released).

Tests compare to upstream branches. (The comparison is a bit difficult because of the number of failures currently in those branches, but failures on the patches are timeouts or matching branch failures/flakies.)



Committed, thank you.  Just in time for releases.

This change has removed {{cassandra-thrift}} from {{{}cassandra-all{}}}. Was this removal intentional?

bq. This change has removed cassandra-thrift from cassandra-all. Was this removal intentional?

No as far as I can remember. It appears commented out, suggesting that may have been an oversight…
