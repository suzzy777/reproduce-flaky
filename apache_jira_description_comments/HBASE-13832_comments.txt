[~mbertozzi] [~enis] FYI

I think we should copy the same semantics for the FSHlog sync / log roll behavior. What we have in FSHlog / LogRoller is this: 
 - Log syncer catches IOException, and logs it, and requests log roll. 
 - Log roller tries to roll the log, and if it gets an IOException in file close, or generic IOException while rolling, it aborts the RS. 

The reason to have the same semantics is that we do not want to cause the master to abort prematurely in case of a recoverable IOException like the one in the jira title. If the RS can ride over generic IOExceptions, the master should do the same.  

Added a patch which has more or less the same logic as FSHLog. it tries to roll on sync failure before aborting the master. 
at some point I'll try to move out the FSHLog stuff and make a generic WAL, so we have a single implementation for the rolling/encryption and similar things.

Thanks Matteo, I'll take a look.

But in most cases, we have >3 data nodes.

Failure of master to start is a problem. Bumping priority and setting some fix-version targets.

[~jinghe] are you able to reproduce? Can you take the attached patch for a spin?

even with the patch the master will not start until the 3rd data node is back.
in theory you should ping pong between the backup masters until something a DN is available.
what the patch does is just retry for some time hoping that a 3rd data node is online, before giving up.

Looks good overall. 

Why RTE, rather than rethrow? 
{code}
+      throw new RuntimeException(e);
{code}

I think we may have an issue about {{syncSlots()}} never throwing an exception. If a procedure executor thread calls {{pushData()}} which internally will wait on {{syncCond}}. In case of an exception in syncer thread, {{syncSlots}} will start the master abort process, but returning from master abort does not guarantee that the proc executor or rest of proc store is stopped. Since {{syncSlots}} does not rethrow the exception,  {{syncLoop}} will continue on and call  {{syncCond.signalAll()}} which will cause the {{pushData}} to return and think that the proc state is persisted, while it is not. 

This new code seems to be a fix for it: 
{code}
+      if (!isRunning()) {
+        throw new RuntimeException("sync aborted");
+      }
{code}
but I think there is no guarantee that when {{master.abort()}} returns, the WALProcedureStore may still be not stopped which means that there is a time window that the procedure can execute assuming persisted state. I maybe missing something in the above analysis though. 

{quote}Why RTE, rather than rethrow?{quote}
to avoid unecessary headache to the caller. the store will succeed or the master will abort. you don't have to write extra code to handle exceptions, because the master is going down anyway. 

{quote}but I think there is no guarantee that when master.abort() returns, the WALProcedureStore may still be not stopped{quote}
we spin until we have running == false
{code}
sendAbortProcessSignal();
while (isRunning()) Thread.yield();
{code}

bq. we spin until we have running == false
Ok that would work. This is still a very indirect way of re-throwing the exception, and seems fragile. Can't we simply get an atomic ref to the exception in sync thread and rethrow it to the pushDate() caller, kind of like simulating SyncFuture ?  

I was trying a test on top of the v1 patch for a different issue, but realized that the attached test causes a hang on the master. I think the reason is that Sync thread now exists abruptly because of RuntimeException from rollWriterOrDie(). The next pushData() call just hangs on {{syncCond.await()}}.

How about this one. We save the exception from sync thread, and re-throw it from pushData() so that we do not do an indirection through {{while (isRunning()) Thread.yield()}}


rethrowing the exception is ok to me, but that is not equivalent to the while (isRunning())

in one of your comment above you said: "I think there is no guarantee that when master.abort() returns, the WALProcedureStore may still be not stopped".
which is true in a generic way, even though currently we know that at least running will be set to false immediately.
what the while (isRunning()) is doing, was just spinning until running was set in case the abort will not be "sync" as it is now. 

to get the same behavior you need to force running to false when you set syncException. so you prevent other procedure to be added.

bq. to get the same behavior you need to force running to false when you set syncException. so you prevent other procedure to be added.
Not sure whether we gain by ensuring that running is set to false before the next execution for syncLoop. Wal store will abort when the master calls abort. Before this happens, concurrent calls to {{pushData()}} will still get the exception because the exception from sync is not cleared at all. So the semantics is that if {{snyc()}} + wal roll fails, we effectively start rejecting all requests for {{pushData()}}, which is kind of similar to making sure to check isRunning(). 

v4 is Enis patch with a fix and a new test for a case with queued writers that were hanging.

still, that catched exception in the syncLoop() and the loop still going instead of aborting or at least spinning until !isRunning() seems strange to me. we know that we must die there. why not exit from that loop? (with the actual implementation of abort we know that running will be false after a sendAbortProcessSignal() but that may not be the case in the future)

bq. we know that we must die there. why not exit from that loop?
We can call {{stop(true)}} directly from Sync loop it is fine. It was not there in your original patch, that is why I did not change it. 
bq. with the actual implementation of abort we know that running will be false after a sendAbortProcessSignal() but that may not be the case in the future
The store can cause an abort to the whole procedure executor or the master itself. Right now, it does this through the ProcedureStoreListener calls. I'm fine with sending an {{Abortable}} directly to the store. These parts are mainly coming from the intiail proc v2 patch. 

Does the test rely on 1s / 2s timing? It may end up being flaky in slow jenkins hosts. Other than that +1 for the v4 patch. If you want to do the abort changes, we can do it here or a follow up. 

calling directly stop() was not what I was proposing. what I was saying was just exiting from the syncLoop(). before with the while (isRunning()) we were spinning after the signal, to make clear that there were no other run of the syncLoop(). in this case we may do another round of the loop and execute stuff which in theory is not what you expect after sending the abort signal.

the test does not rely on the 1s/2s timing, it passes even without. but I was trying to make the problem more clear  to someone looking the code.

bq. org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.procedure.TestWALProcedureStoreOnHDFS
This is the new test from the patch. Seems related. 
bq. before with the while (isRunning()) we were spinning after the signal, to make clear that there were no other run of the syncLoop(). in this case we may do another round of the loop and execute stuff which in theory is not what you expect after sending the abort signal.
I guess we can rethrow the exception after here: 
{code}
+        } catch (Throwable t) {
+          syncException.compareAndSet(null, t);
{code}

+1 for v6 patch.
