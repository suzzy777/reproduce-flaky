This Jira proposes to add the following two improvements:
 # wget -N option for checking timestamp of downloaded RC files, if the local copy of downloaded file is identical on the server, that file will be ignored.
 # mvn -fn to never fail running the tests, previously with option -fae I could not get the whole suite to run w/out failing.
