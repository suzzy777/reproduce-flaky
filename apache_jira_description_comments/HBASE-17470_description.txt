HBASE-16119 moves the merge region to the master-side.  There is no need to keep region_server-side merge region code to remove logic duplication.  

util.Merge and HMerge tools depends on RS-side merge region logic.  However, now we can merge regions using shell command.  It is dangerous to do offline merge.  For 2.0, it is a good time to remove those out-of-date tools.
