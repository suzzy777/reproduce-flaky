[~dhamon] did you add these new metrics? Can you take a look?

That's curious. That suggests that the status update is not being received at the master, but I see it in the log.

We could remove the metrics from the test temporarily, but it suggests that there's some wait missing in the test itself, or some check not present.

Assigning to [~dhamon]: please follow up, this test is consistently flaky on our internal CI.

looks like waiting for the status update acknowledgement message should be enough.

The master updates the metrics in {{updateTask}}, called from {{statusUpdate}}. It's possible that the StatusUpdate message has been sent (which we check for) but not acted on by the Master yet, hence the metrics have not been updated. Waiting for the explicit acknowledgement is a proxy signal that the Master has updated the metrics.
