{code}
        final ConsumerRecords<byte[], byte[]> records = pollRequests();

        if (state == State.PARTITIONS_ASSIGNED) {
{code}
Can the if block be lifted ahead of the pollRequests() call ?
When there is no active running task at the end of the if block, runOnce() can return early without calling pollRequests().

    [WIP] KAFKA-6085: Pause all partitions before tasks are initialized

    Mirror of #4085 against trunk. This PR contains two fixes (one major and one minor):
    
    Major: on rebalance, pause all partitions instead of the partitions for tasks with state stores only, so that no records will be returned in the same `pollRecords()` call.
    
    Minor: during the restoration phase, when thread state is still PARTITION_ASSIGNED, call consumer.poll with hard-coded pollMs = 0.

This is actually not a bug, but only introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/4085 trying to improve restoration latency. Resolving this as Not A Problem.
