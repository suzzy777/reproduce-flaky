The {{nodetool}} utility provides a utility to print out the {{gossipinfo}} for the cluster. The output is then printed out as text to stdout and consumed by operators and tools built around {{nodetool gossipinfo}}.

With the introduction of virtual tables in Cassandra, the {{gossipinfo}} virtual table can help operators and the tools built around {{gossipinfo}} to consume the gossip information more easily by providing a tabular output of the data, which can be easily queried by different clients.
