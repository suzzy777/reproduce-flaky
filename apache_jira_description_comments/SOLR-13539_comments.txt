SOLR-13539: Fix mv update of UUID, enum, bool and binary fields

Co-Authored-By: Thomas Wockinger


Pushed new version with additional DirectJson tests

Not sure if it's a similar issue or not, but we're seeing this problem with the {{removeregex}} atomic update operation (class cast when it tries to turn the javabin values into a String, inside the doRemoveRegex method).

btw I previously raised a Jira with more tests for these operations, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-9505 although I don't know if those would have caught the javabin problem.

First of all i think it is related and second i am pretty sure that [~gerlowskija] only merged it to branch v8, i am currently waiting on getting the whole tests on atomic updates into the main line too

Thanks Thomas, yes we're using 7.7.2 and having trouble, as we use AtomicUpdates heavily. We applied the patch from SOLR-13538 and then we applied your patch from your Github PR (although we excluded the unit tests from your patch) which fixes most thing (thank you). I have attached a further patch we had to do locally to make removeregex work (it looks like it was fixed for the single value case, but multiple values were still failing) perhaps you could add that further fix onto your larger change, or if not I can raise a separate ticket.

To be honest, this whole situation with the javabin change is getting confusing, with various partial fixes and it's not clear to me which fixes are on the 7.x branch. Right now, 7.7.2 standard is effectively broken. Thanks for your efforts to try and get this back stable.

I will have a look at your tests. If they are still failing at the master, i will create a different PR which is referencing your issue

bq. To be honest, this whole situation with the javabin change is getting confusing, with various partial fixes

I agree, the situation has become quite confused.  Partially to blame is my slowness in reviewing some of Thomas' PRs.  Also contributing is that this bug was found and reported in a handful of different JIRAs, each reporting various levels of progress and not kept up to date.

(This is worth apologizing again for: I thought tags on github PRs were making it through my email filters, but apparently not.  My inattention on Thomas' PR's is embarassing.  Sorry Thomas.  I'm glad you tagged me on jira.)

So let's try to clarify.  My understanding is that all of the atomic-update ByteArrayUtf8CharSequence cast issues have been fixed on {{master}} and {{branch_8x}}.  All the remaining open PRs are test improvements.  Thomas has two PR's open: PR #665 and PR #755.  It looks to me like #665 depends on #755 (755 introduces a new test-base, 665 changes some existing tests to use this new class).  And Tim has proposed some additional unit tests in SOLR-9505 (as well as suggesting a change to our documentation).  At a glance both of these sets of test changes are complimentary to each other, and we can merge both of them after review.

Does that match your understanding of things [~thomas.woeckinger]?

bq. it's not clear to me which fixes are on the 7.x branch. Right now, 7.7.2 standard is effectively broken.
Thomas is right- I haven't made an attempt to backport this to the 7x code line.  Primarily because I don't expect any more 7x releases.  There might be a 7.7.3 if some serious security issue is found, but even in that case the aim would be to introduce as little change into 7.7.3 as possible, and only fix the security issue itself.  I can make a case for backporting if a 7.7.3 comes up, but there might be pushback depending on the release manager.

Yes, i agree.

Thanks Jason and Thomas for summarising.

When you say all the cast issues are fixed on master and 8x, does that include the small patch I added to this ticket, for the removeregex multi-value situation?

It seems a shame that these fixes are not going to be on the 7x branch, as I say above it means the last 7x release is effectively broken. For us, we're using 7.7.2 but with the various fixes added on our local build, so we're OK .. but others using 7x with atomic updates, and not prepared to use a local build, should be aware.

bq. When you say all the cast issues are fixed on master and 8x, does that include the small patch I added to this ticket, for the removeregex multi-value situation?

It doesn't.  But I have bundled that in with Thomas' changes in my local testing and will make sure it makes it to master and branch_8x.

Speaking of which, test "beast" runs look pretty good, so I'll go forward with committing this later this week, or this weekend.

SOLR-13539: Fix MV removeregex atomic-updates

Prior to this commit, the ByteArrayUtf8CharSequence issues had been
fixed on single value removeregex commands, but not if multiple regex's
were used.

This commit fixes our NamedList parsing for this additional case.  It
also adds some tests for related atomic-update cases.

Hi [~TimOwen] and [~thomas.woeckinger], wanted to follow up on this.

As far as I know, all the pieces of this are now merged into {{master}}.

# the original fixes for the UUID, bool, enum, etc. field types
# Introduce an EmbeddedSolrServer test base-class (PR: 755)
# New Xml and Javabin tests (PR: 665)
# The patch attached on this issue covering a gap around mv removeregex operations
# Some additional test cases and changes Tim authored on SOLR-9505.

Have I missed anything in the list above?  I'm working on backporting these changes now so that they can all go into the 8.3 release.  Once that backporting is done I'll close this and the related issues.  But if I've missed anything, let me know!

That's great, thanks Jason.

I will close SOLR-9505 as that's now incorporated into this ticket's change so we don't need it anymore.
