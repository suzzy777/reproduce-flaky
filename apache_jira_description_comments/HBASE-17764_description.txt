When I doing testing for a feature I am working on, the TestMultiSlaveReplication test was flaky.  TestMultiSlaveReplication#testMultiSlaveReplication would always pass when running alone; however, it would fail occasionally when running with the suite (the other test TestMultiSlaveReplication#testZKLockCleaner always run first and I suspect that it withhold some zookeeper resource, which caused the problem).  

After I set start and shutdown zk cluster before and after each test, I no longer see the problem.
