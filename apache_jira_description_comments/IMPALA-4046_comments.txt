Same failure started showing up in the latest build in 2.7.0-5.9.x: http://sandbox.jenkins.cloudera.com/view/Impala/view/Evergreen-cdh5-2.7.0_5.9.x/job/impala-cdh5-2.7.0_5.9.0-core-asan/3/

[~twmarshall], [~kwho] any reason to believe this is a product bug, or are we confident it is a test issue?  What do we know so far?

I believe the failure is specific to the slowness of ASAN build. The test was expecting "'Cancelling Query" in stderr when the Impala shell was killed.
However, by the time Impala shell was killed, it was still slowly crawling through the import statements in impala_shell.py which is before the
signal handler is installed. As a result, we never got the error message expected.

From that perspective, it's likely a test bug. It's unclear what caused the extra slowness recently but the fix is likely to be increasing the sleep time before killing the shell in test_cancellation() test.

[~kwho] - just out of interest, why was Python code ({{impala_shell.py}}) so slow in the ASAN build? 

[~henryr], I have no solid idea. Is the system more loaded somehow with ASAN build ? It only started failing recently. Did we change the AWS instance for this test recently ?

It seems weird that it would be more loaded for the shell tests, which don't use a lot of concurrency IIRC. ASAN binaries are obviously much slower, and if the shell imports had a dependency on an RPC that called into an ASAN binary somehow that would explain it (but would be unexpected). 

Agreed that this is probably not a product bug. Michael's theory about asan being slow was my guess as well, though I haven't been able to reproduce it yet.

Could someone take this over for me? I'm out on PTO for a week starting tomorrow.

Has anyone seen this happen beyond the two builds mentioned here? I haven't been able to reproduce it, and if its not something anyone is seeing I'll downgrade the priority.

closing since we haven't heard anything about it happening in a while
