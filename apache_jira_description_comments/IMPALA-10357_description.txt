We found in a recent build that a test case in [test_basic_joins()|https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/tests/query_test/test_join_queries.py#L71] does not fail with the expected error. This test reads the test case at [joins.test|https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/testdata/workloads/functional-query/queries/QueryTest/joins.test#L846-L850] and verifies if the returned result is "{{Debug Action: FAIL}}".

According to the output to standard error, two related queries are of query id's "{{1a49038843b6b4da:30f6228100000000}}" and "{{9f4e869839247e75:d01b009300000000}}".

Using these two query id's, we excerpted the related log entries from two log files of impalad's.

Since this test was recently revised in IMPALA-9309, maybe [~tarmstrong] could offer some insight into it. Assigned it to Tim for now but feel free to re-assign it as you see appropriate. Also let me know if some other logs are needed for investigation. Thanks!
