- We annotate tests as Small/Medium/Large and define time limits for each, we should use them so tests fail fast and we can run Flaky-Tests job more frequently.
- It'll be hard to do so for all existing tests (1200+ Test*.java files), but I'd like to do it for at least those known to hang up. (Found by using report-flakies.py on TRUNK)
- In some places, we have @Rule Timeout but it actually sets timeout for atomic tests.
Basically we can't go the way where we define time limits on class level (Small/Medium/Large tests) and try to enforce timeouts on atomic tests level. It would be painful (probably why no one has done it yet).
So i'll be changing these timeouts to
{noformat}
@ClassRule
  public static final TestRule timeout = CategoryBasedTimeout.forClass(<test_class>);
{noformat}
