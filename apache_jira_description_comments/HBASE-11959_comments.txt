This is very likely related to HBASE-11604. After which, we don't put meta on master any more by default. Some tests will be flaky if meta region server is restarted in the middle.

Makes sense.

This is for branch 1 only. This patch puts meta on master during this test. We have separate tests to test meta region server recovery, where meta is moved to a region server from master at first.

+1 if the tests succeed. 

I tested related tests 10 times locally and they are good with this patch. Integrated into branch 1. Thanks.
