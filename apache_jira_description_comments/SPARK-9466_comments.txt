Tests in this sutie have 1 minute timeout. But, seems even when tests in this pass, tests take almost 1 minute (it may cause CLI gets terminated?). Let me try to increase the timeout and see it fixes the test.

I ran into this again today with what looks like a 2 min timeout ? https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/43069/consoleFull
