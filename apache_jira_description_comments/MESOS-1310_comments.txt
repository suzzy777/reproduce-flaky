I agree with your assessment after reviewing the log/stacktrace and walking through that code path myself.
I was, however, unable to reproduce the test failure on my box, even after >800 iterations of the same flaky test.
I am considering writing a test specifically for the case where a slave tries to (re)register before the master finishes authenticating, but here's the review for the fix in the meantime:
