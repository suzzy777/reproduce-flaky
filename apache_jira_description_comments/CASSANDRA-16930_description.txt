In order to support CEP-10 we must enable deterministic execution within Cassandra, support disabling certain optional features that are incompatible with simulation, and support overriding some existing features. 

Some determinism will be enabled by the Simulator itself, but there are aspects of Cassandra that must be made compliant as well. This includes: compression system-wide, memtable overhead computation, specifying the number of processors used for computation/decisions, specifing all cache sizes explicitly, enabling deterministic table IDs, and supporting deterministic node IDs for TimeUUID creation.

We also want to be able disable sstable activity tracking, and to be able to happily ignore problems with native filesystem methods and SIGAR. We also want to be able to override the migration delay, batch sync interval and system auth replication factor.

For pluggability we also want to be able to specify a custom FailureDetector.
