ZOOKEEPER-1634 introduced an option to allow user enforce authentication for ZooKeeper clients, but the enforced authentication scheme in committed implementation was SASL only. 

This JIRA is to generalize the authentication scheme such that the authentication enforcement on ZooKeeper clients could work with any supported authentication scheme.
