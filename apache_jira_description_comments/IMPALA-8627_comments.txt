IMPALA-8627: Enable catalog-v2 in tests

This patch enables catalog-v2 by default in all the tests.

Test fixes:
1. Modified test_observability which fails on catalog-v2 since
the profile emits different metadata load events. The test now looks for
the right events on the profile depending on whether catalogv2 is
enabled or not.
2. TableName.java constructor allows non-lowercased
table and database names. This causes problems at the local catalog
cache which expects the tablenames to be always in lowercase. More
details on this failure are available in IMPALA-8627. The patch makes
sure that the loadTable requests in local catalog do a explicit
conversion of tablename to lowercase in order to get around the issue.
3. Fixes the JdbcTest which checks for existence of table comment in the
getTables metadata jdbc call. In catalog-v2 since the columns are not
requested, LocalTable is not loaded and hence the test needs to be
modified to check if catalog-v2 is enabled.
4. Skips test_sanity which creates a Hive db and issues a invalidate
metadata to make it visible in catalog. Unfortunately, in catalog-v2
currently there is no way to see a newly created database when event
polling is disabled.
5. Similar to above (4) test_metadata_query_statements.py creates a hive
db and issues a invalidate metadata. The test runs QueryTest/describe-db
which is split into two one for checking the hive-db and other contains
rest of the queries of the original describe-db. The split makes it
possible to only execute the test partially when catalog-v2 is enabled
