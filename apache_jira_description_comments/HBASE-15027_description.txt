As per suggestion given over in HBASE-14970, if we need to create a single thread pool service for the CompactionHFileDischarger we need to create an exectuor service in the RegionServer level and create discharger handler threads (Event handlers) and pass the Event to the new Exectuor service that we create  for the compaction hfiles discharger. What should be the default number of threads here?  If a HRS holds 100 of regions - will 10 threads be enough?  This issue will try to resolve this with tests and discussions and suitable patch will be updated in HBASE-14970 for branch-1 once this is committed.
