Today, Windows and parts of the Hadoop source code still use HADOOP_HOME.  The switch to HADOOP_PREFIX back in 0.21 or so didn't really accomplish what it was intended to do and only helped confuse the situation.

_HOME is a much more standard suffix and is, in fact, used for everything in Hadoop except for the top level project home.  I think it would be beneficial to use HADOOP_HOME in the shell code as the Official(tm) variable, still honoring HADOOP_PREFIX if it is set.
