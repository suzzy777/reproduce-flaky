The case fails at line 116, where message is null. I guess this may be an openjdk-specific behavior, but it would be nice to have it fixed although openjdk is not officially supported.

FYI: The exception is thrown with null message at java.net.SocksSocketImpl.

{code}
    private static int remainingMillis(long deadlineMillis) throws IOException {
        if (deadlineMillis == 0L)
            return 0;

        final long remaining = deadlineMillis - System.currentTimeMillis();
        if (remaining > 0)
            return (int) remaining;

        throw new SocketTimeoutException();
    }
{code}
