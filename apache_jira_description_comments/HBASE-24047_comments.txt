Attach patch of one-liner disable. Did it on branch-2 and branch-2.3 only for now. Master seems more stable and is using different technique according to comment in test method so leaving for now.

Pushed on branch-2.3 and branch-2 but not on master.

The patch for this has been +1ed, ready to be merged. https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/1260

Nvm, ignore my last comment, taking deeper look, this is a different issue.

[~bharathv] would be cool if related. Can retry once it goes in...

Thanks Stack. I'll investigate after I get that other one wrapped up. A couple of follow on things for it, as well.
