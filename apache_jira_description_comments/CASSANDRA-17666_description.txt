For the CDC-enabled tables, a special write path is employed during streaming. The mutations streamed are written into commit log first. 

There are scenarios that the commit logs can accumulate, which lead to failure of streaming and blocking writes. 

I'd like to propose adding a dynamic toggle to disable the special write path for CDC during streaming. 

Please note that the toggle is a trade-off. Because the special write path is there in the hope to ensure data consistency. Turning it off allows the streaming to pass, but in some extreme scenarios, the downstream CDC consumers may have holes in the stream, depending on how they consumes the commit logs.
