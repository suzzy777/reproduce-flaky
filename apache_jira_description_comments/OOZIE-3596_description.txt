When the SSH action is terminated via the kill API, only the ssh-wrapper.sh file (created for ssh execution in oozie) is terminated, and the child-processes that has occurred is still running.

For example, if the shell file for running spark-shell (e.g. called "run-spark.sh") runs and exits as an SSH action, only the ssh-wrapper.sh file exits and the child-processes (run-spark.sh and spark-shell) are still running.

Therefore, when the SSH action is killed, it must be changed to the kill command that can terminate the related subprocess.
