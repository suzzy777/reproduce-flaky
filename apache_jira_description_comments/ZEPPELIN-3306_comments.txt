    @zjffdu 
    Can you help review this? Looks like this was actually because of the latest version of chrome (65.0.3325.146) and had to update webdriver-manager's chrome version.

    Thanks @prabhjyotsingh , LGTM, the selenium test still fails due to corrupted scala jars, could you clean travis cache and rebuild it again to make sure all the test pass ?

    @felixcheung it doesn't happen always but at times before could Zeppelin-server start test case starts executing, and by making `spawn="false"` maven waits for the command (./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start) to complete, and `CI=true` make zeppelin-daemon to wait for localhost:8080 to be active.
