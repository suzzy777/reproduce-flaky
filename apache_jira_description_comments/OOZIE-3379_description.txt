We have a program that connects to multiple Oozie clusters with multiple {{AuthOozieClient}} instances, which frequently request the KDC server because the authentication token cache is invalid.

After some investigation we found that the auth token cache file is incorrectly shared by all {{AuthOozieClient}} instances. Therefore, we propose that the auth token cache file name include Oozie URL as postfix.
