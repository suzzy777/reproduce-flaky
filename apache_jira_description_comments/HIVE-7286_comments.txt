With this patch, the above tests are running (and passing) against the following storage formats: RCFile, ORC, SequenceFile.

With HIVE-4329 fixed, then the tests should be able to pass when run against the Avro and Parquet SerDes as well.

I don't think these two test failures are related.

Hi, I have some high-level comments.  This is a good idea, but I think it will be much cleaner once HIVE-5976 is implemented?

One more thought, I'm a bit hesitant on enforcing all new HiveSerdes to must plugin to this test.  It seems hard for some Serde, the way the test is written.  As test uses metastore schema, to get Avro to plugin, you have written a lot of test-code to translate metastore-table to avro schema, and even tests to test that code, maybe its over-complicated.

There is a conf SERDESUSINGMETASTOREFORSCHEMA, would it work to first enforce tests for those serdes?  Or not sure if the test can be re-factored to make it simpler for avro to be pluged-in?  What do you think?


Thanks for your feedback, Szehon.

I also think that this patch will be much cleaner once HIVE-5976 is done. Do we expect that it will be committed soon?

For SERDEUSINGMETASTOREFORSCHEMA, do you mean that we can use it to have the AvroSerDe use the metastore schema and not have to specify an Avro schema?

Yea it seems worthwhile to get HIVE-5976 in, thanks for your help in that.

Sorry for late response.  Those Serdes in SERDEUSINGMETASTOREFORSCHEMA use the native hive metadata to determine schemas, instead of ones like avro that specify it outside.  Hence those can easily plug into HCatMapReduceTest via params, as it creates table using native hive metadata.  But I'm personally not that eager to force other Serde to plugin to the test, as you had to write lengthy schema-conversion code for avro to do that, that is test-only code and a burden to maintain as there's no real use-case elsewhere for that.  I think its wonderful if a test framework can automatically generate tests for new serdes, but I don't think it should enforce this unnecessary work on new-serde devs, as test-coverage can be achieved in more natural ways.  

Hence, would it make sense to just automate/enforce paremeterization of the test for serde's in SERDEUSINGMETASTOREFORSCHEMA, and handle other serdes like avro as a one-off?

Hi [~szehon], thanks for taking the time to review this patch and for your feedback and advice.

I have made some progress finishing HIVE-5976 and fixing the remaining test failures. However, as I am working on that patch, I realized that it only covers the current set of "native" SerDes, i.e. Sequence File, text, Parquet, ORC, and RCFile but not Avro and any of the other SerDes found throughout the Hive codebase. However, I do not think that this test should be limited to only covering those storage formats or only the ones in SERDESUSINGMETASTOREFORSCHEMA. They should cover all SerDes in the Hive codebase, especially since it is very likely that the other SerDes are actually being used; we use Avro almost exclusively here at LinkedIn.

After further thought, Avro is a particular special case because it requires an Avro schema to be set in the SerDe or table properties, and as a result, the test code must provide the TypeInfo to Avro Schema converter. This is a requirement that other SerDes do not have. At the same time, the TypeInfo to Avro Schema converter has good test coverage and will become useful when we make the AvroSerDe a native Hive storage format and remove the requirement for specifying an Avro schema, which should definitely be done in the future.

SerDe devs would only be required to add an entry to the table in the test with the SerDe class and nulls in the other fields. This would indicate that HCatalog is not being tested against the new storage format.

I am currently blocked on HIVE-5976 because there seems to be some issues with the pre-commit tests; even so, I think I will need to spend some more time to finish that patch. After further thought, after HIVE-5976 is committed, I think we will still want to keep most of the code in this patch and just modify the test to make exceptions using the enumeration of StorageFormatDescriptor in place of the TestStorageFormat classes (which is nearly identical to StorageFormatDescriptor).

Since this patch is ready and expands the coverage of the HCatMapReduceTest tests to run against RCFile, ORC, and SequenceFile and that HIVE-5976 will take more time to complete, I think we should go ahead and commit this patch and open a new ticket to make the necessary changes to these tests once HIVE-05976 is done. I am also working on adding a similar fixture to the HCatalog Pig Adapter tests, which also requires this patch.

OK that sounds reasonable.  So if I understand correctly, this patch will enforce test only on serde's registered via StorageFormatDescriptor, which is trivial for serde author.  Avro wont be tested until its registered that way, at which point there wont be a need to specify avro-schema and hence also trivial.

bq. SerDe devs would only be required to add an entry to the table in the test with the SerDe class and nulls in the other fields. 

Can we make a total no-op for serde author, ie the test auto-generates the parameters based on StorageFormatDescriptor list?

Currently, the patch will only test against the entires in the table that specify a TestStorageFormat class since there is currently no way to infer the mapping of SerDe to InputFormat/OutputFormat. Once HIVE-5976 is in, then the TestStorageFormat classes will be removed and the StorageFormatDescriptor classes will be used. However, this will require additional code changes to properly handle storage formats with configurable SerDes, such as RCFile. The test code for Avro is in this patch, but the tests (along with the tests for Parquet) will currently fail due to HIVE-4329.

To clarify, once HIVE-5976 is in and the corresponding changes to this fixture are made, then SerDe devs would only need to add an entry to the table if they _do not_ want their SerDe tested against HCatalog.

HIVE-5976 has been committed. I have rebased on trunk and updated the fixture to make use of StorageFormatDescriptor from HIVE-5976.

I have updated RB and attached a new patch.

Adding a new patch with updated code comments.

Since this patch pretty much contains test changes and the above test that are failing, including the TestHCatLoader test, are in other projects, they do not seem related.

Hi David, can we get rid of StorageCustomHandler once HIVE-6806 is committed?  Would it make sense to commit that first, so this is cleaner?

Also just my two cents, I'm still not in favor of the test inspecting the classpath and failing if a certain serde hasn't been either registered by StorageFormatDescriptor or excluded by the test.  Like what if you wrote a test serde, then you need to go to this test and put it on the exclude list otherwise it will fail.  Or what if you have a dirty classpath, it still seems a bit flaky to me.  Can we get rid of that part?  Again I'm ok with generating parameters for the StorageFormatDescriptor serdes and even the 'additional' serdes

Hi Szehon,

Thank you for your feedback.

Yes, once HIVE-6806 is committed, we will be able to get rid of StorageCustomHandler. However, since this patch has been complete and working for quite some time now, I think it is better to push ahead and get this patch in, even if HIVE-6806 has not been committed yet. Removing StorageCustomHandler is easy to do, and I can open a separate ticket and do that once HIVE-6806 is in. My main concern is that it is difficult to say when HIVE-6806 will be done and committed, and I would rather not have this patch be blocked for too long because it is blocking other HCatalog test work that I am doing.

I understand that the use of reflection in the test will make SerDe development a bit more involved, but I think that it is, in fact, better if SerDe development is made more rigorous. I think that ideally, all SerDes and Input/OutputFormats in Hive should be accounted for by the set of StorageFormatDescriptors in Hive. Otherwise, it will be increasingly difficult to enforce a consistent code quality and test coverage for all available storage formats supported by Hive.

[~szehon] - By the way, I have opened HIVE-7440 to remove StorageCustomHandler once both this patch and HIVE-6806 are committed.

Thanks David.  I'd rather have HIVE-6806 committed first if it shouldn't take too long. 

As for the classpath part, we are at a disagreement.  I respect your desire to make the Serde contract stricter, although I feel its a bigger topic than this JIRA.  But even if thats the decision, having an HCat test be the enforcer seems strange.  To me, its an illogical module to enforce that (should be in Hive if thats the case), and prone to error (say if you end up in an environment where the test's classpath is different).

Thanks for reviewing this patch, [~szehon]. I have removed the reflection code. The fixture is now testing against the set of native storage formats and the ones specified in additional storage formats list in the test since the native storage formats are regarded as the "official" and most complete storage formats supported by Hive.

I will open another ticket to add documentation about this to the Wiki.

Thanks a lot, David, appreciate it.  Can you update the review board if you haven't already? 

Thanks, Szehon.

I have uploaded a new patch with the code for enumerating storage formats into its own utility class for better reuse with other tests. I have updated RB as well.

[~cwsteinbach] has added a comment to HIVE-6806 asking whether there is any more feedback on that patch. Unless there is additional feedback, it looks like HIVE-6806 might get committed in the next few days. In that case, let's wait for that patch to go in, in which case I will be able to remove the StorageCustomHandler code from this patch.

By the way, I have opened HIVE-7485 for adding the documentation.

HIVE-6806 was just committed today. I have rebased my patch on trunk and removed all the code that special-cases for Avro (i.e. StorageCustomHandler, etc). I also moved the utility class for enumerating storage formats into the ql module's test sources for better code reuse.

I have attached a new patch and updated RB.

Thanks David, took a look and just had a few more comments/questions on the rb.
