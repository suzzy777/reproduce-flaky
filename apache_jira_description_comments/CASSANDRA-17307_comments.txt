[Repeated runs|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1680/workflows/f8c846a3-7768-4326-b7cb-e25da4dab2d7/jobs/17618] of this test hit both the timeout mentioned on the description and the failure reported on CASSANDRA-17641, CASSANDRA-17642, CASSANDRA-17651 and CASSANDRA-17652.

The test combines queries expected to succeed with writes expected to timeout. One one hand, the queries that should succeed require a timeout config large enough to avoid accidentally timeouts queries due to a slow env. One the other hand, the queries that should timeout benefit from a not-so-long timeout config so the entire test doesn't hit a JUnit timeout.

I guess that what we can do here is increasing the query timeout config, so the queries expected to succeed don't timeout on the coordinator, and also split the test into multiple classes so there are less queries per test. That ways the queries that should timeout on the coordinator wouldn't produce a Junit timeout.

The problem is that the {{ShutdownException}} reported on the other tickets is far more common than the timeout, so it's difficult to solve the timeout without fixing the {{ShutdownException}} bug before.

Agreed CASSANDRA-17636 is the probable root cause. It didn't repro now that it has been merged. Should we optimistically close and reopen if needed [~adelapena]?

[~bereng] I'm afraid that there is more than CASSANDRA-17636 going on here. As mentioned in my comment above, the test hits CASSANDRA-17636 quite frequently but it also has a problem due to timeouts. The error reported on the description is one of these. It can still be reproduced after applying the patch for CASSANDRA-17636, as it's shown by [this run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1807/workflows/96f294f3-b960-41d0-a82a-a1f8e8ead584].

The patch spitting the test is almost ready, I'll publish it in a bit.

The proposed patches for [4.1|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1714] and [trunk|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1715] split {{MixedModeAvailability*}} tests so each read-write consistency level pair is tested on its own class. That gives us a lower runtime for each class, so we can increase query timeouts a bit without hitting the JUnit timeout.

The patch for 4.1 also ports back the fixes applied to {{MixedModeAvailabilityTestBase}} in trunk by CASSANDRA-17656 and CASSANDRA-16586.

Here are repeated runs for the six test classes extending {{{}MixedModeAvailabilityTestBase{}}}:

All of them pass, except the one for {{MixedModeAvailabilityV3XQuorumQuorumTest}}. It has hit a different error that seems related to cluster shutdown. Not sure whether we should try to address that issue here or proceed with this test splitting as it is.

It seems there was a mistake on the way that exceptions are handled on the test, I've just fixed that too. With that and the splitting it survives 400 iterations on every split:
