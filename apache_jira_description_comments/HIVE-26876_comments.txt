I merged the PR but in the future when disabling a flaky test please provide some URLs showing that a test is flaky. Also include any kind of relevant information (e.g., stacktraces) in the JIRA ticket (see previous JIRA tickets for examples). 

Fixed in https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/3dd34eade1c56c594693f0179f386a03969111f6. Thanks for the PR [~amanraj2520]!
