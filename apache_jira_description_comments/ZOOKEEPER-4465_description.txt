zooinspect logback config file logback.xml currently use a pattern of this

 
{code:java}
<pattern>%5p [%t] (%F:%L) - %m%n</pattern> {code}
which not escape the '(' and ')', cause logback to ignore parts after ')'.

 

 

according to logback documents, '(' and ')' is used for grouping, need escape by '\' if used as normal char

will create pr update it to 
{code:java}
<pattern>%5p [%t] \(%F:%L\) - %m%n</pattern> {code}
