- Remove the configuration hbase.coordinated.state.manager.class
- Keep following interface since they nicely separate ZK based
implementation: SplitLogWorkerCoordination, SplitLogManagerCoordination,
ProcedureCoordinatorRpcs, ProcedureMemberRpcs
- Replace CSM (interface) + BCSM (unnecessary middle hierarchy) with single
CSM interface.
- Don't pass whole CSM object around (with server in it which gives acess to pretty much everything), only pass the relevant dependencies.
