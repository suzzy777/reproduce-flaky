There are instances where we log, and output strings for json objects and other things that are quite expensive.

These are done regardless of the log level being enabled and can increase performance significantly:

https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-platform/metron-writer/metron-writer-storm/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/writer/hdfs/HdfsWriter.java#L127

We need to find places where this happens, and employ the best practice check for the log level being enabled ( best practice if your parameters or log message construction takes a lot of time ).
