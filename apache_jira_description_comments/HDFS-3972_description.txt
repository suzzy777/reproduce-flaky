In a secure HA cluster, we're seeing the following issue on the NN when the trash emptier tries to run:

WARN org.apache.hadoop.fs.TrashPolicyDefault: Trash can't list homes: java.io.IOException: Failed on local exception: java.io.IOException: javax.security.sasl.SaslException: GSS initiate failed [Caused by GSSException: No valid credentials provided (Mechanism level: Failed to find any Kerberos tgt)]; Host Details : local host \
is: "xxxxx"; destination host is: "xxxx":8020;  Sleeping.

The issue seems to be that the trash emptier thread sends RPCs back to itself, but isn't wrapped in a doAs. Credit goes to Stephen Chu for discovering this.
