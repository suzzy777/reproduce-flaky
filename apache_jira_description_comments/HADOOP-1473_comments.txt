This sounds reasonable to me.  +1

This patch adds the "job tracker start time" to all of the job and task ids. This should make all of the job ids unique on a given job tracker.

Having job ids contain an easily-readable jobtracker start time does not add much utility, and it costs a lot of screen space.  I'd vote to use base 36 instead, for both the jobtracker start time and the job number.  This would render a job id as something like "jkxio1-001", half the size for the same range of values.

The Hadoop-QA failure seems to be streaming TestSymLinks, which is generally flaky and not the fault of the patch. (Although I did have to change other tests to work with the new job ids.)

Base-36 numbers are ugly and hard for users to remember and distinguish. I can figure out yesterday's date in the readable form, but not in base-36. I think it is a big usability hit to make the numbers unreadable. I often have people tell me look at job 75 on node1000. That is much harder if it is some strange combination of digits and numbers.



> Base-36 numbers are ugly and hard for users to remember and distinguish.

Longer numbers are harder to remember and distinguish.  Personally, it is easier for me to remember "jkx3y7" than "200706081453".  In both cases, if I'm scanning visually I'm likely to check only the last few digits.

> I often have people tell me look at job 75 on node1000.

That would change to "look at job 23 on node1000".  Is that onerous?  Even if it were "look at job 2v" would that be a problem?

+1 on owen's suggestion. its looks much cleaner  and also is easy to grep on the logs with the jobs ran on some day and some month.

+1 for date/times, they're generally easier to remember than random strings.

Also, do we want the date/time of the jobtracker re-start to be in the job name? Would it make sense to just re-cycle job id's every day? 
When scanning for a job it would be easy to scan for 'job 4 from Wednesday the 11th', rather than 'job 4 after the restart on Wednesday the 11th'



> its looks much cleaner and also is easy to grep on the logs with the jobs ran on some day and some month.
The date in the job's id is not intended to be the date job is run but the JT is started.

> +1 for date/times, they're generally easier to remember than random strings.
you do not have to remember the dates' unless you're dealing with jobs' which run on (now) stopped JT. 

IMO as far as "look at job 75" is concerned, i think either method would make no difference. 
       look at job 75 => find {{job_200706081450_00075}}
or   look at job 75 => find {{job_jkx3y7_00075}}

my vote is to 4-6 digit hash of the JT start time
       look at job 75 => find {{job_4390_00075}}

but now it is harder to explain what 4390 is to new comers. 


I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!
