[~satishsaley], can you please check if TestBundleSubmitXCommand can be extended with one test case covering this issue?

I have also noticed that the implementation of
{code:java}
ELUtils#resolvEnabled(String expression, Configuration conf){code}
is almost the same as 
{code:java}
ELUtils#resolveAppName(String name, Configuration conf){code}
Also, there are some places when resolveAppName is used for resolving other expressions than the name. This can be a little confusing.

Wouldn't be better to have instead of this two methods only one containing a third parameter of type class? Something like:
{code:java}
public static <T> T resolveExpression(String expression, Configuration conf, Class <T> clazz){code}
