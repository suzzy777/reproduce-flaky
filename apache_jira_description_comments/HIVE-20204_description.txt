Noticed this while looking at HIVE-20082.
The type conversion done during GenericUDFIn (via ReturnObjectInspectorResolver) uses FunctionRegistry.getCommonClass(), whereas the other comparison operators (=, <, >, <=, >=) use FunctionRegistry.getCommonClassForComparison(). As a result, dec_column IN ('1.1', '2.2') compares the values as strings, whereas dec_column = '1.1' would compare the values as doubles. This makes a difference for HIVE-20082 since it is related to changing the 0-padding during decimal-to-string conversions.
