Two tests always fail on TC with the assertion

{noformat}
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Failed to wait for disconnect/reconnect event.

from client disconnect/reconnect events check. Obviously client doesn't generate these events as it supposed to do.
(TC runs can be found [here|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_IgniteZooKeeperDiscovery&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F3730%2Fhead&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv]).

It is possible to reproduce test failure locally as well, but with low probability: one failure for 50 or even 300 successful executions.
