{{AsyncCreateReplica}} is the class that sends CreateTablet request and retries in case of failure.

Constructor of {{AsyncCreateReplica}} sets a default deadline of 30 secs which is less than the default deadline of 1hr set by the base class constructor {{RetryingTSRpcTask}}.
https://github.com/apache/kudu/blob/master/src/kudu/master/catalog_manager.cc#L3390

{{FLAGS_tablet_creation_timeout_ms}} is used in 2 places:
 - while setting deadline for the {{AsyncCreateReplica}}
 - issuing DeleteTablet RPCs in case of failure to CreateTablet after the timeout of FLAGS_tablet_creation_timeout_ms

The deadline is honoured and no additional RPC requests are scheduled on crossing the deadline.

https://github.com/apache/kudu/blob/master/src/kudu/master/catalog_manager.cc#L3287

I was able to verify this by tweaking {{CreateTableITest::TestCreateWhenMajorityOfReplicasFailCreation}}.
Verified that CreateTablet RCPs time out and no additional ones are issued to the tablet servers.

Next I can work on a unit test that proves that CreateTable RPCs are not retried indefinitely.

----

On other note, I noticed a bug in the {{CreateTableITest::TestCreateWhenMajorityOfReplicasFailCreation}} test that would have been the cause of flakiness fixed by this [commit|https://github.com/apache/kudu/commit/d119d529beb691a84134d02e33ecdce6102a7a35]

https://github.com/apache/kudu/blob/master/src/kudu/integration-tests/create-table-itest.cc#L133-L134

Thanks for finding that 30s deadline; I didn't notice that and assumed the retrying is indefinite (or "close to indefinite" i.e. 1 hour). I was working off the behavior I saw in CreateTableITest_TestCreateWhenMajorityOfReplicasFailCreation which finishes in under 30s.
