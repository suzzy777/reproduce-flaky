RetryingMetaStoreClient has a bug in the following bit of code:

{code}
        } else if ((e.getCause() instanceof MetaException) &&
            e.getCause().getMessage().matches("JDO[a-zA-Z]*Exception")) {
          caughtException = (MetaException) e.getCause();
        } else {
          throw e.getCause();
        }
{code}


The bug here is that java String.matches matches the entire string to the regex, and thus, that match will fail if the message contains anything before or after JDO[a-zA-Z]\*Exception. The solution, however, is very simple, we should match (?s).\*JDO[a-zA-Z]\*Exception.\*
