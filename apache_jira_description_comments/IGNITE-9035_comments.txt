    IGNITE-9035 Update log4j 2x version in Apache Ignite

----


[~dpavlov], I changed log4j version to 2.11.0. Also I successfully built fabric by DEVNOTES.txt steps. Tests are ok - they don't fail by log4j change.

[~SomeFire], I've also checked tests run, and all suspicisous test are rare flaky failures.

Merged to master.

Thank you for contribution!
