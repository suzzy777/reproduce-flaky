LeaderElectionContextKeyTest is very flaky -- and on millers beastit reports it shows a suspiciously close to "50%" failure rate.

Digging into the test i realized that it creates a 2 shard index, then picks "a leader" to kill (arbitrarily) and then asserts that the leader election nodes for *shard1* are affected ... so ~50% of the time it kills the shard2 leader and then fails because it doesn't see an election in shard1.
