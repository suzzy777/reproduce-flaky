This will throw a retriable `RebalanceInProgressException` which Streams does not currently expect. 

A possible fix is to change the condition of while(isRunning()) inside runLoop to sth. like isRunning() || !taskManager.rebalanceInProgress(), and within an iteration after weâ€™ve added the records we will check isRunning() again and if false we would skip processing any records anyways.
