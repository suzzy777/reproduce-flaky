bq. would it make sense to increase the timeout again?

If you see the test becomes more stable with this change, then why not. Alternatively, the test can potentially be changed to not depend on timing, but I don't know how difficult that is.

It seems that the issue might not be the interval itself, but the "delay" method in BlobStoreStatsTestableFileDataStore.

EDIT: NOT TRUE

So it seems that the actual problem is in the test case; it uses jackrabbit-data's RandomInputStream with System.currentTimeMillis as seeds for two streams which are supposed to be different. However, the return value can be the same, either because the system is really fast, or the time resolution is >> 1ms, as usually under Windows.
