When indexing to SolrCloud, an error may occur: "ClusterState says we are the leader ..., but locally we don't think so".  It's temporary and should be retried by SolrJ.

Original title: "CollectionsAPIDistributedZkTest.testCollectionsAPI fails regularly with leader mismatch"
Original description by Varun:
I've been noticing lots of failures on Jenkins where the document add get's rejected because of leader conflict and throws an error like 

{code}
ClusterState says we are the leader (https://127.0.0.1:38715/solr/awhollynewcollection_0_shard2_replica_n2), but locally we don't think so. Request came from null
{code}

Scanning Jenkins logs I see that these failures have increased since Sept 28th and has been failing daily.
