Writing a slice from row n of length m of an array to feather would write the first m rows, instead of the rows starting at n.

The null bitmap also ends up misaligned. Also tested and fixed in the pull request below.
 I've created a pull request with tests and fix here: [Pullrequest#1766|https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1766]
