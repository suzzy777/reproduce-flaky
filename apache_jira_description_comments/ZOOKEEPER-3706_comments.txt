[~yfx416] [~hanm] I think I am facing a similar issue (maybe because of the fix or the cause of 3706) in my environment. I have created a ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3828 which has the logs and behavior similar to it. The SendThread of ZooKeeper client stays in the connecting (or rather reconnecting) state until I restart the leader node again. 
I feel we need to re-look this.

[~symat] Can this be a reason for my issue (3828)?

This issue is not merged in 3.6.1. It seems this is merged only in master. 

This JIRA change is present in master, branch-3.7 and branch-3.7.0. So changed the fixed version from 3.6.1 to 3.8.0,3.7.0

this was actually cherry-picked to multiple branches already. Usually we haven't created separate Jira tasks / PRs for the cherry-picks (except ZOOKEEPER-4223 for branch-3.6). I updated the fixed versions to: 3.5.10, 3.6.3, 3.7.0, 3.8.0
