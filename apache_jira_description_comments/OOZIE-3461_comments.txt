Thanks [~nobigo] this patch looks great. I thinkÂ we could clean up the followings in this class:
 * It should be also useful to log the lock acquiring and not only the releasing ( like in PauseTransitService ).
 * Some of the methods have useless {{throws}} in the declaration. For instance {{materializeCoordJobs}} never throws {{JPAExecutorException}}.
 * We could use the diamond operator in several places.

Could you also address these issues? It would also be useful to check the findbugs/checkbugs output.

Hi,[~asalamon74],Ok, I will address these issues.
