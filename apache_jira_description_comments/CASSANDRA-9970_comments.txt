Thanks for reporting the problem. The issue is a perfectly valid one.

The problem comes from the fact that the second query is not considered as an {{IN}} query due to a problem in {{PrimaryKeyRestrictionSet}}.

The patch fixes the problem and add a unit test to verify the behaviour when paging is off.
The DTest patch add a test to verify the behaviour with paging.

[~Stefania] could you review?

Sure.

Patch is +1, great job! 

Let's rerun the 2.2 dtests to shake off some flaky tests and let's apply the patch to 3.0 as well and check the CI results there too before committing.

The new unit tests caught a problem in the 3.0 branch. I found that there was an issue with the descending ordering for IN relations on the partition key columns. 

I added some extra tests.

+1.

I found a dtest on 2.2 failing only on this branch but it is clearly unrelated (Gossip) and therefore I opened CASSANDRA-10089 for it.
