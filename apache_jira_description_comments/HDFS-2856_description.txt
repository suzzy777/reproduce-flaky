Since we send the block tokens unencrypted to the datanode, we currently start the datanode as root using jsvc and get a secure (< 1024) port.

If we have the datanode generate a nonce and send it on the connection and the sends an hmac of the nonce back instead of the block token it won't reveal any secrets. Thus, we wouldn't require a secure port and would not require root or jsvc.
