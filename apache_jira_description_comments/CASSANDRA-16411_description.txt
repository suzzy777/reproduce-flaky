Dtests with multi-dc setups don't update the topology properties file of a newly joining node without dc post cluster creation.

The new node will join dc1 but it's snitch will report the default snitch config as it doesn't get updated == dc1 == all nodes are in dc1 == there are no other dcs. That leads to bootstrap, token, startup,... problems. Let's see an example:
- populate [1, 1, 1]
- Node1 sees: dc1/ip1, dc2/ip2 and dc3/ip3
- Node2 sees: dc1/ip1, dc2/ip2 and dc3/ip3
- Node3 sees: dc1/ip1, dc2/ip2 and dc3/ip3
- Add a new Node4
- Node4 sees: dc1/ip1+ip2+ip3+ip4

All multi-dc dtests that add a node after cluster creation suffer this problem.

Solution: When a new node is added without specifying a dc in dtests check for existing dcs. If there are any force to specify one to update the topology file.
