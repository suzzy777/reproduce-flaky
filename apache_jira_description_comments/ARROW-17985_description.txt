A few odd things are going on with the Python bindings:
 # Statefulness. I ran the following code:

{code:java}
import os
import pyarrow.fs as arrow_fs
def fs_():
    s3_fs = arrow_fs.S3FileSystem(
        access_key="<token>",
        secret_key="<token>",
        endpoint_override="<cloudflare r2 url>",
    )
    return s3_fs
fs = fs_()
print(fs.get_file_info("data"))
{code}
and it worked on one machine but not the other. Only setting
{code:java}
region="auto"
{code}
 allowed the code to work consistently on both computers.
Furthermore, the error message is very opaque:

{code:java}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "cluster_scripts/test_s3.py", line 51, in <module>
    print(fs.get_file_info("data"))
  File "pyarrow/_fs.pyx", line 439, in pyarrow._fs.FileSystem.get_file_info
  File "pyarrow/error.pxi", line 143, in pyarrow.lib.pyarrow_internal_check_status
  File "pyarrow/error.pxi", line 114, in pyarrow.lib.check_status
OSError: When getting information for bucket 'data': AWS Error [code 100]: No response body.
{code}

Googling this error gives no information whatsoever. I managed to figure out the issue by switching from Cloudflare to S3, and when the issue was still going on, I explicitly set a region, but the experience was pretty painful.
