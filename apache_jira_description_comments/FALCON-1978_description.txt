1. The unit tests in MetadataMappingServiceTests are failing randomly as the test cases depend on specific sequence of execution, but they do not have dependency annotation set properly.

2. A specific test related to cluster update MetadataMappingServiceTest.testOnClusterEntityChange() is failing because the COLO (data center) relationship to CLUSTER is not properly added/updated during cluster update.
