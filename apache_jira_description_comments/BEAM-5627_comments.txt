[~tvalentyn] can you also add the command and tips to reproduce it?

[~tvalentyn] can you also assign this Jira ticket to me. Currently, I am not able to assign this to me.

[~rakeshkumar] & [~splovyt]: this is caused by the test that create inputs with `str()`, which behaves differently between Py3 and Py2. See table below([source|https://timothybramlett.com/Strings_Bytes_and_Unicode_in_Python_2_and_3.html]): 
|Python 2|this string literal is called a "str" object but its stored as bytes. If you prefix it with "u" you get a "unicode" object which is stored as Unicode code points.|
|Python 3|this string literal is a "str" object that stores Unicode code points by default. You can prefix it with "b" to get a bytes object or use .encode.|

Adding .encode('utf-8') will resolve these issues.

Rakesh FYI. 

 

Fixed this issue in a few modules while I am already fixing some other issues.  [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/6610]

 

 

[~ruoyun] thanks for fixing this.

[~rakeshkumar] Did you check if there are any other tests in IO module that still fail with this error?

[~rakeshkumar] Feel free to close if this error is completely gone.

Valentyn is right, there are a lot of them in the tests.

 

I will take care of [filesystems_test.py|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/6610/files#diff-9bc1968a10d6ef5df1a1690027a774b0] and [io/sources_test.py|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/6610/files#diff-aa300c32e00d2cbf44349027b526271f] (apparently they will affect internal test, will need extra efforts anyway). 

I'm currently porting the full io package, and have already fixed a lot of these tests, so I've assigned the issue to myself.

The test passes on Python 3, but consistently leaves a trail of warnings:

WARNING:root:After 101 concurrent splitting trials at item #1, observed only failure, giving up on this item
WARNING:root:After 101 concurrent splitting trials at item #2, observed only failure, giving up on this item

These warnings are rare on Python 2. We should investigate this.

[~tvalentyn] I don't see these warnings when running the test locally.

Can you check [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7878] and see if you still get these warnings?

[~Juta], I still see these warnings, see below. I reproduced them on my linux laptop with Python 3.5.4, as well as inside a Docker container running 3.5.6 following the setup described in  [https://s.apache.org/beam-py3-conversion-quick-start].

I investigated why this test leaves warnings:

This test executes two threads  where one will try to read data and the other thread will try to spilt the data which is only possible if the first thread did not finish executing. The test will not leave any warnings if both execution orders are observed when running the threads 100 times (at least once succeeding the split and at least once failing). In python 3 threads are implemented differently which results in the threads always executing in the same order even when executing 1000 times because the threads duration is too short to be interrupted. If I increase the duration of both threads by adding `time.sleep(0.003)` the test does not leave any warnings.

Test code regarding threads: [https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/source_test_utils.py#L651]

Conclusion: this test needs to be redesigned for Python 3. Do you have any suggestions on how to handle this?
