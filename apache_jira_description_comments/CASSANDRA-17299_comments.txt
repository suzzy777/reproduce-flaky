I would say we check whether this one fails often and either take care to raise the timing or whatever is needed or if it happens extremely rare we can mark as not a blocker but just 4.x

Marking as duplicate of CASSANDRA-17606 as I noticed the recent failures, the only we have logs for, match in both tickets.
