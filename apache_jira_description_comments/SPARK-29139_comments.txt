Looks like the build was super slow at that moment:
|[test driver discovery under local-cluster mode|https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/110759/testReport/org.apache.spark/SparkContextSuite/test_driver_discovery_under_local_cluster_mode]|15 sec|Failed|
|[test gpu driver resource files and discovery under local-cluster mode|https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/110759/testReport/org.apache.spark/SparkContextSuite/test_gpu_driver_resource_files_and_discovery_under_local_cluster_mode]|10 sec|Failed|

Though "test resource scheduling under local-cluster mode" was successful, it has been elapsed mostly under 10 secs, even under 20 secs for longestÂ around 5 pages of history.

Other tests should have pretty higher timeout like it to handle such kind of slowness.

Somehow this wasn't marked as resolved when PR was merged. Could you handle this? Thanks in advance!

This is resolved via https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25864

Sure. Sorry for the delay, [~kabhwan].

No problem! I was trying to resolve by myself and realized I can't change assignee so needed to ask for help. Thanks for the quick turnaround!
