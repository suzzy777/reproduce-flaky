Scan queries with Local flag and non-null Partition can be executed directly against Platform Near Cache, avoiding Java calls.

Partition must be reserved before iteration to guarantee that it is local and does not move away while we iterate. Failed reservation should cause an exception - canâ€™t do a local query for a non-local partition.
