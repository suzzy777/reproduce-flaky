Right now in StateStoreSuite, the tests of get/put/remove/commit are mixed with numKeys metric test. I found it is flaky when I was testing with other StateStore implementation. Specifically, we also are able to check these metrics after state store is updated (committed).  So I think we can refactor the test a little bit to make it easier to incorporate other StateStore externally.
