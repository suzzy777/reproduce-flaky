report-flakies.py now outputs a file dashboard.html.
Then the dashboard will always be accessible from https://builds.apache.org/job/HBASE-Find-Flaky-Tests/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dashboard.html
*(See [this external link|http://hbase.x10host.com/flaky-tests/] for pretty version.)*

Currently it shows:
Failing tests
flakyness %
count of times a test failed, timed out or hanged
Links to jenkins' runs grouped by whether the test succeeded, failed, timed out and was hanging in that run.

Also, once we have set timeouts to tests, they'll not be "hanging" anymore since they'll fail with timeout. Handle this minor difference in findHangingTests.py and show the corresponding stats in dashboard.
