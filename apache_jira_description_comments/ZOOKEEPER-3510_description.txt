As mentioned in https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/1054#discussion_r314208678 :

There is a {{sleep 3}} statement in {{zkServer.sh restart}}.  I am unable to unearth the history of that particular line, but I believe part—if not all—of that {{sleep}} should be part of {{zkServer.sh stop}}.

I frequently observe {{FAILED TO START}} errors in the C test suite; the logs consistently show that those are caused by {{java.net.BindException: Address already in use}}.  Adding a simple {{sleep 1}} before {{echo STOPPED}} "fixes" it for me.  I will submit an initial PR with the corresponding change and a commit message akin to:

ZOOKEEPER-XXXX: Make zkServer.sh stop more reliable

Kill is asynchronous, and without the sleep, the server's TCP port can still be busy when the next server is started—causing flaky runs of the C client's test suite.

(It would probably be better to spin a few times, probing with ps -p.)

As noted above, the sleep is far from optimal, an adaptive mechanism would be better—but I do not want to make the first iteration too complicated.
