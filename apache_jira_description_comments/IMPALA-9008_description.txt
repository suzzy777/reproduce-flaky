Building impala-minimal-hive-exec fails time to time while downloading one of it's dependencies (Guava 14.0.1). In the mvn logs of failed builds impala-minimal-hive-exec and ext-data-source were running in parallel, and latter also downloads Guava 14.0.1. This lead me to assume that this is a similar issue to IMPALA-7051.
