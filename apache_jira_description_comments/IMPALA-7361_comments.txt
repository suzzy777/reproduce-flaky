I looked at the logs and it seems like the instance of the first query that ran in this test (which reserves 2G of memory on each host) never completed on the host on the port 22001. Since admission controller looks at the max of (mem_admitted[host], mem_reserved[host]) == max (0, 2GB) it queued the query based on that and it eventually timed out with the wrong error message.

Note: The mem reserved for a query that is currently executing is its limit_, if set (which should be the common case with admission control). Otherwise, if the query has no limit or the query is finished executing, the current consumption is used.

IMPALA-7361: Fix flakiness in test_heterogeneous_proc_mem_limit

This patch fixes flakiness in test_heterogeneous_proc_mem_limit wherein
one of the fragments on a host from a previous query lingers and holds
on to resources which causes the next query to fail the test since it
expects the cluster to be idle at that point.
