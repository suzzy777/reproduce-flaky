Many EC tests are failing in pre-commit runs. e.g.
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/21055/testReport/
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/21052/testReport/
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/21048/testReport/

This is creating a lot of noise in Jenkins runs outputs. We should either fix or disable these tests.
