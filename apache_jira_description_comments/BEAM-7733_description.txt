Some of Python performance cron tests on Dataflow experience some problems because of: 
{code:java}
AssertionError: Job did not reach to a terminal state after waiting indefinitely.
{code}
 

Dataflow returns following errors: 
{code:java}
"error": {
     "code": 404,
     "message": "(bf55d279f24d1255): Information about job 2019-07-07_08_42_42-8241186059035490445 could not be found in our system. Please double check the id is correct. If it is please contact customer support.",
     "status": "NOT_FOUND"
   }
 }
{code}
Those tests are success on Dataflow, but Jenkins returns failure. 

It already happened in Combine and CoGroupByKey tests:

 * [example of CoGBK|https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Beam/view/All/job/beam_LoadTests_Python_CoGBK_Dataflow_Batch/3/console]
