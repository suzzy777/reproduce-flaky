The stats tables such as TAB_COL_STATS, PART_COL_STATS have redundant columns such as DB_NAME, TABLE_NAME, PARTITION_NAME since these tables already have foreign key like TBL_ID, or PART_ID referencing to TBLS or PARTITIONS. 
These redundant columns violate database normalization rules and cause a lot of inconvenience (sometimes difficult) in column stats related feature implementation. For example, when renaming a table, we have to update TABLE_NAME column in these tables as well which is unnecessary.

This JIRA is first to deprecate the use of these columns at HMS code level. A followed JIRA is to be opened to focus on DB schema change and upgrade.
