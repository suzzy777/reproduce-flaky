[~stoty] [~vjasani] Hello. As I understand it, the 2.4.8 is soon available. So, I am going to wait for this release and change the pull request to `Bump default HBase version to 2.3.7 and 2.4.8`, what do you think?

   The test failure is a limitation of the Yetus HBase rebuild logic, which doesn't rebuild the old version.
   
   Please run a full test (dev/rebuild.sh <hbase_version>, then mvn verify -Dhbase.profile=<profile>) with both HBase versions manually, and check the results. 
   (There are some flaky tests, you may ignore or re-run those)

   I have manually triggered the build for this PR. At least we will get test results for 2.4.8 version. @luocooong thanks for your work, if you are planning to include 2.3.7 as well, could you please run `mvn verify` as suggested by @stoty ?

   Thanks @luocooong. Or on the other hand, we can bump 2.3.7 on 2.3 release line as a separate PR and on that PR we will try to run test with 2.3.7 with a temporary commit to change default profile. Once satisfactory QA results are available, we can revert that temp commit and merge the PR.
   That way this PR can focus on 2.4.8 alone.

   @virajjasani That's how it was! Before that, I was curious about why we separated the different versions to commit. Thanks for your explanation.
