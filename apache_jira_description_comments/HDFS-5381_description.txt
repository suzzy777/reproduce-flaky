{{ExtendedBlock#hashCode}} contains both a block pool ID and a block ID.  The {{equals}} function checks both.  However, {{hashCode}} only uses block ID.  Since HDFS-4645, block IDs are now allocated sequentially.  This means that there will be a lot of hash collisions when federation is in use.  We should use both block ID and block pool ID in {{hashCode}} to prevent this.
