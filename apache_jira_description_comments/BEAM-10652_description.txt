[Clustering|https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/clustered-tables] without time partitioning is allowed in BigQuery, but we specifically reject it:

https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/5e0e798ddd827fd212ac89b8c6f6f2cf9e4b29a5/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryIO.java#L2511-L2515

We should remove this check and add tests for clustering without time partitioning.
