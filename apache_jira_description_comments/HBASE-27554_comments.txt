Deleting the latest x flaky reports would not solve the problem because all the currently available exclude list contains this "malformed" test name. The Nightly test does have some older runs without this failure. I'm considering dropping the newer branch-2.4 nightly runs so the flaky finder tool would not consider it as a failing test.

Found [this nightly test|https://ci-hbase.apache.org/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-2.4/473/artifact/output-jdk11-hadoop3/patch-unit-root.txt] output where the WARNING is in the same line with the Running org... line. The Find Flaky Job considers this test as hanging because there is no finished test of this name:

"org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.TestZKReplicationQueueStorageWARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release"

{noformat}
WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
[INFO] Running org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.TestZKReplicationQueueStorageWARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release

[INFO] Running org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.TestZKReplicationPeerStorage
[INFO] Running org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.asyncfs.TestFanOutOneBlockAsyncDFSOutput
{noformat}

Sidenote: It seems like the report-flakies.py script gets the first patch-unit-root.txt from the archived artifacts list and does not check the rest. In this case, it was the output-jdk11-hadoop3/patch-unit-root.txt and the rest of the runs are ignored.

After deleting the corrupted nightly build the new flaky dashboard does not contain this invalid test name. I've triggered a new Nightly job on branch-2.4.

Recent nightly tests were successful on branch-2.4 after the cleanup.

Thanks [~psomogyi] for fixing this!
