I have cherry-picked the branch-3.7 commit to branch-3.6 we can close this issue.

I tested manually the server

I cherry-picked this to branch-3.5 and tested manually. (haven't touched the ant build scripts, but using maven on branch-3.5 now we have reload4j)

Hi [~eolivelli] . It's mentioned here that the issue is also fixed as a part of 3.6.4 version of Zookeeper. But there is no 3.6.4 available in maven central / repo. Am I missing something here?Â 

Because 3.6.4 has not been released yet.

Please ask on [dev@zookeeper.apache.org|mailto:dev@zookeeper.apache.org] about the release date, we can find a volounteer to cut the release
