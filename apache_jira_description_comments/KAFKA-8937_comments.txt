This failure is for `SaslScramSslEndToEndAuthorizationTest.testNoDescribeProduceOrConsumeWithoutTopicDescribeAcl`

Seems both are related.

This test has just failed again for me. Apparently, it is not fixed.

Unfortunately, Jenkins didn't capture the logs or exception, so the only thing I have is the console output:
{noformat}

kafka.api.SaslPlainSslEndToEndAuthorizationTest > testNoDescribeProduceOrConsumeWithoutTopicDescribeAcl FAILED
    org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: Consumed 0 records before timeout instead of the expected 1 records
{noformat}

I doubt this is enough to go on, though...

This is a bug in the implementation and is being fixed under KAFKA-9190.
