Pushed a commit with the change [here|https://github.com/iamaleksey/cassandra/commits/13953-4.0]. Jenkins dtest run results to be available [here|https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Cassandra/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/373/], and circle utests [here|https://circleci.com/gh/iamaleksey/cassandra/56].

Changes made:
1. Simplified {{MetadataSerializer.deserialize()}} method by splitting toc decoding logic into two loops and removing some nesting/branching in components decoding loop
2. Switched from MD5 to CRC32
3. Added checksums to size and overall toc, so that we don't allocate buffers too big because of corruption in either size or toc offsets.

In addition to that, removed {{MetadataSerializerTest.testMcReadNa()}}, as there is no expectation of compat between majors. Also added a few tests (ma read ma, mb read mb, mc read mc, and na read na) to cover roundrtip ser/deser.

+1

Utests had a 100% perfect run, dtests were noisy as they recently have been.

I've diffed the error report with cassci's most recent trunk run, and the following tests failed that shouldn't have:

I ran every single one of them locally, and all of them passed (one or two are flaky and required two attempts).

Committed to trunk as [912fdb3ea4ff58ae9e1fe0c9b230ec76273ff601|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/912fdb3ea4ff58ae9e1fe0c9b230ec76273ff601].

Thanks for the review!

Running {{ant eclipse-warnings}} will fail with the following error:

[~spodxx@gmail.com] yeah, CASSANDRA-13996

It's a bogus warning, but the fix is underway anyway.
