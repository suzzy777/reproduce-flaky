Many of the tests in {{org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.capacity.TestLeafQueue}} fails with the following error message running on JDK11:

{noformat}
[ERROR] testSingleQueueWithOneUser(org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.capacity.TestLeafQueue)  Time elapsed: 0.204 s  <<< ERROR!
org.mockito.exceptions.misusing.WrongTypeOfReturnValue:

YarnConfiguration cannot be returned by getRMNodes()
getRMNodes() should return ConcurrentMap
***
If you're unsure why you're getting above error read on.
Due to the nature of the syntax above problem might occur because:
1. This exception *might* occur in wrongly written multi-threaded tests.
   Please refer to Mockito FAQ on limitations of concurrency testing.
2. A spy is stubbed using when(spy.foo()).then() syntax. It is safer to stub spies -
   - with doReturn|Throw() family of methods. More in javadocs for Mockito.spy() method.

This is due to the actual execution of the call, while we need to record only the invocation of it. According to the javadocs and other folks.
