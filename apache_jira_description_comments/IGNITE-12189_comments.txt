[~Yuriy_Shuliha], good try. I've left few comments to the PR.

Change in PlatformCache can broke text queries in .NET. Let's make a stub and fix it later within a new ticket.
Other my comments relates to code styles.

[~Yuriy_Shuliha], looks better. 
I've added a few more comments and start a TC.

[~amashenkov] thank you for starting TC Bot.
Can the results be interpreted as positive for current PR ?

Yuri,
Check code style test failed due to
[10:00:03][ERROR] /opt/buildagent/work/7bc1c54bc719b67c/modules/indexing/src/test/java/org/apache/ignite/internal/processors/cache/GridCacheFullTextQuerySelfTest.java:71: 'VARIABLE_DEF' should be separated from previous statement. [EmptyLineSeparator]

I've found you mark all my PR notes as resolved, but not all of the issue are actually fixed.
Please, check if you forget to push some changes.

"Queries 1" test results looks weird as they doesn't look flacky and I can't figure out how your changes can affect them.
Possibly, you've created a branch from quite old master when these tests were broken.
Please, merge you branch (PR) with the latest master and re-run tests.

[~amashenkov] - I have made corrections according to your notes. Here's the tests run result (above).
Can the PR be merged now ?

Thanks.
I've just found you apply 'limit' on reduce side inside CacheQueryFutureAdapter.

Assume, you have few nodes, small pageSize (10 entries per page) and large enough 'limit' = 1000.
So, you'll get about 100 pages from every node and about 1000 in total, but most likely you want only first 100 pages.

For now query initiator node sends 1 GridCacheQueryRequest and can get multiple GridCacheQueryResponse-s per remote.
TextQuery processing finishes when all remotes send GridCacheQueryResponse with 'finished' flag.
Seems, TextQuery processing  should be reworked like it was done for SQL queries.

Ignite has GridQueryNextPageRequest \ Response classes for SQL result processing.
Similar processing should be implemented for TextQueries. 
This looks like a big change which allow us to add correct sorting and apply limit correctly on reduce . 

Let's create a separate ticket for this and link it to current one, then I'll merge PR to master.



[~amashenkov] IGNITE-12291 ticket was created and linked

On behalf of [~amashenkov] 
>>>
I've found GridCacheQueryFutureAdapter has newly added AtomicInteger
'total' field and 'limit; field as primitive int.

Both fields are used inside synchronized block only.
So, we can make both private and downgrade AtomicInteger to primitive int.

Most likely, these fields can be replaced with one field.
>>>

'total' and 'limit' merged into single 'totalCnt' int variable
Corresponding unit tests have run successfully.

[~Yuriy_Shuliha],
i've left a comment to the PR. 

Let's keep correct semantic for 'limitCnt' field. This costs nothing, but makes code easy to understand and debug.

[~amashenkov], [~Pavlukhin] the recent changes requested by you were implemented.  Current realization still coming with 0  or less as unlimited value. Lets go with this or consider -1 to move forward this PR.

[~Yuriy_Shuliha], sorry a delay. A little rush these days on my schedule. I will return to it tomorrow.

[~Yuriy_Shuliha], I left comments on GitHub.

[~Pavlukhin]  - did resolved according to your comments. Please check GitHub.

[~Yuriy_Shuliha], check a couple of comments on GitHub. I see that a couple of new tests fail on [TC|https://mtcga.gridgain.com/pr.html?serverId=apache&suiteId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll&branchForTc=pull/6917/head&action=Latest]. Please fix failures and get TC bot visa once again before merge.

[~Pavlukhin]  - #2 did resolved according to your comments. Please check GitHub

[~Pavlukhin] - running TC tests now ([https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=4747159&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll])
From 19 failed tests 15 are suggested by TC as flaky, 14 of them are new as well. The tests related to Text Queries are green.
 Could you please suggest how to proceed with this? What is the acceptable steps to resolve/consider this PR to be ready to merge?

[~Yuriy_Shuliha], the PR looks fine to be merged. If there is no work to be done, I will merge it, please confirm.

[~Yuriy_Shuliha], could you please create a ticket about passing `List` instead of `Collection` to `GridCacheQueryFutureAdapter#enqueue` method?

[~Pavlukhin] There's no more work to be done on the ticket. Please do merge.
CC [~dmagda@apache.org]

[~Pavlukhin]  - Sorry for delay, was on vacation last week. I will create the ticket about passing `List` in nearest day-two.

[~Yuriy_Shuliha], thank you for contribution! Merged to master in https://github.com/apache/ignite/commit/cee961560f410653009915b61d821dab84ea490a

[~Yuriy_Shuliha], could you please fill in "Release Note" field with short description of introduced feature?

[~Pavlukhin] - added the "Release Note"
