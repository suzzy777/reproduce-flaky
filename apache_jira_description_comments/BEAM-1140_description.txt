The test fails about one in 10-20 times or so when run in "Run until failure" mode in IntelliJ (I did it 3 times; once it failed on the 3rd run, once on the 15th, once on the 40th).

It's making precommits unstable (e.g. currently https://github.com/apache/incubator-beam/pull/1565 failed with this test error).

Unfortunately I don't understand enough about the Apex runner to understand what's going on and fix this myself...
