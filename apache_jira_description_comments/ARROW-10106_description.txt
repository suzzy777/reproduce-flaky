OutboundStreamListener has a method isReady() that FlightProducers need to poll during implementations of getStream() to avoid buffering too much data.

An enhancement would be to allow setting a callback to run (for example, notifying a CountdownLatch) so that FlightProducer implementations don't need to busy wait.
