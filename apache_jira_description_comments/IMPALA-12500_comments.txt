Hi [~csringhofer], assigned this JIRA to you since you recently revised the test at [IMPALA-12430|https://github.com/apache/impala/commit/fb2d2b27641a95f51b6789639fab73b60abd7bc5#diff-a317a4067b5728a2d0af9839c1dce94710e7bd50825ceffc0a3c88aca3e27de3R553] and thus may be more familiar with the test. Please feel free to reassign the JIRA as you see fit. Thanks!

IMPALA-12500: Reduce flakyness of test_global_exchange_counters

to make the test consistently green.
