We've seen a few flakes like this; where the link fails during the test and then works later. I wonder if there's a way to configure some retry+backoff on the test.

I haven't seen this in a while, but I'll keep open for a bit just in case.

Ack, I'll take a look. Thanks for attaching context to this bug.

I ran this locally without hitting these failures many times, so they seem like uncommon flakes.

The website pre-commit validates external links, and has [sane timeouts configured|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/41dd6e1d651b41bd75f04e7a8ac536c8a62ef0ea/website/Rakefile#L7] (90s connect, 3min roundtrip).

It would be nice to be able to add retries, but the html-proofer doesn't have this functionality. There is an [existing feature request|https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer/issues/310] which we can track.

I don't think there is anything actionable right now. If we find a particular domain is unreasonably flaky, we can exclude it. Otherwise, I think our configuration is sane and it's valuable to have these checks.

I've opened https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7393 with various cleanup to the config file.
