This is on 8u45. Haven't see it flake on 7u79 locally. Also happens on ASF Jenkins from time to time.

Related, and what I've seen up on Jenkins before:

FlushRegionEntry includes the amount of remaining delay, a _wall clock time dependent value_, into its calculation of hashCode. The test injects a ManualEnvironmentEdge with a fixed value for currentTime, with the expectation this will produce objects that are equal to each other, but TestFlushRegionEntry is a small test, so isn't the only test running in the JVM, or using EnvironmentEdgeManager.

+1

I cleaned up the unit test in general, but the observed problems were confined to 0.98 code. 

On that branch FlushRegionEntry used System.currentTimeMillis instead of EnvironmentEdgeManager in some places, and EnvironmentEdgeManager in others. I didn't catch that right away. So, we'd flake whenever creation of 'other' was ahead in system clock time from when 'entry' was created. I've fixed that in the 0.98 patch here. The other patches are just the test improvements. 

Thanks for the +1 Ted, will commit later today.
