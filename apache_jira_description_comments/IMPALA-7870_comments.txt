[~tianyiwang] Since you've seen this before, assigning to you.

We've been hitting this at least once a week - can we fix it or tweak the timeout?

IMPALA-7870: Increase the timeout in test_v1_catalog

TestAutomaticCatalogInvalidation.test_v1_catalog need to wait for a
predefined time for the invalidation to take effect. The test is flaky
recently because of it. This patch increates the timeout by 2.5x.
