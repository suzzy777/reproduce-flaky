Randell,

The 'expect: 100-continue' stuff was very flaky and was giving us a lot of
headaches, which finally prompted us to refactor it just a few days ago. Two
phase request body write has been eliminated. I regret that you have had to make
this massive research in order to fix this ugly piece of code. 

I'll mark the report as invalid for the time being. Please re-test your
application against the CVS HEAD and re-open the bug report if the problem persists.

Oleg
