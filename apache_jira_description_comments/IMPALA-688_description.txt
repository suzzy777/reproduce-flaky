These tests fail with wrong results on some builds. Unlikely there is a product issue we need to fix now but the failed builds is annoying.

At least one of the problems is how we estimate #rows. We do this based on the size of the table in hdfs which is not deterministic (WAL, compaction, etc).

It seems there might be another issue with col stats.
