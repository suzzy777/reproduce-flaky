Hi [~maoling],

Thank you for these reports about flaky tests. We have to fix/improve them, one by one, and having tickets is a first step.

I believe this one has been taken care of, however: I widened its window from 5s to 20s in ZOOKEEPER-4200, which was merged by Enrico on 2021-02-17â€”two days before this ticket was filed. And looking at this:
{noformat}
AssertionFailedError: expected: <20.0> but was: <27.3333>
{noformat}
it looks like it would have succeeded with the new version.

Would you have a reference of the commit with which it happened?
