When hive.fetch.task.conversion kicks in - UDF configure is not called.

This is likely due to MapredContext not being available when this conversion occurs.

The approach I suggest is to create a dummy MapredContext and provide it with the current configuration from ExprNodeGenericFuncEvaluator.

It is slightly unfortunate that the UDF API relies on MapredContext since some aspects of the context do not apply to the variety of engines and invocation paths for UDFs which makes it difficult to make a fully formed dummy object such as the Reporter objects and the boolean around if it is a Map context.
