    SAMZA-1261: Fix TestProcessJob flaky test

    Fix flaky test TestProcessJob testProcessJobKillShouldWork which was failing due to thread timing issues that were causing the test to fail intermittently. Also refactored ProcessJob to make it less prone to similar issues and added more unit tests.
