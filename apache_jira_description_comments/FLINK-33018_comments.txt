[~jjayadeep] [~rskraba] Any thoughts on what might cause this? The only update that was merged recently was FLINK-32031

[~martijnvisser] - Shouldn't the assert just check for ("A","B") as mentioned - [https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-gcp-pubsub/blame/4fdaca7b42969d19bd939c0823afb5372c51461b/flink-connector-gcp-pubsub/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/gcp/pubsub/PubSubConsumingTest.java#L109-L119C62] or change the assert to include Array List to ("A","B","C")

[~jjayadeep] I don't know, if you think that's the fix then more then happy to get it merged :)

Let me look into it and raise a PR

I checked and looks like the test was flaky, I re-ran it in my environment and it passed successfully. Can you please re-run the test

_If I understand correctly_ -- the *"C"* element is meant to be acked but not emitted in this test.  This (third) end-of-stream message indicates that processing is finished, so it _should_ have two emitted elements (A and B) but three acknowledged ids (1, 2, and 3).

I'm reading through the code, and I don't believe there's any relevant changes due to the bom bump.  Is this always reproducible in the build environment or is it flaky?  If flaky -- how flaky?  Often or rarely?

I don't have any good hypothesis for the moment. Maybe there's a synchronization issue on the private test class [collecting the acks|https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-gcp-pubsub/blob/c06e25a97c5f74873db9d272a4f2cf4787185c4a/flink-connector-gcp-pubsub/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/gcp/pubsub/PubSubConsumingTest.java#L214]?  That doesn't seem quite right, since the {{notifyCheckpointComplete}} should have [already occurred|https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-gcp-pubsub/blob/c06e25a97c5f74873db9d272a4f2cf4787185c4a/flink-connector-gcp-pubsub/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/gcp/pubsub/common/AcknowledgeOnCheckpoint.java#L84] just before the assert.

Any other clues that might help narrow this down?

Hey, I can reproduce this -- all you need to do is run this test about 12,000 times ;)  (using IntelliJ repeat until fail).

{code}
Connected to the target VM, address: '127.0.0.1:44879', transport: 'socket'

org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: 
expected: ["1", "2", "3"]
 but was: ["1", "2"]
Expected :["1", "2", "3"]
Actual   :["1", "2"]
{code}

I'm taking a look.

I ran it 23K times yesterday and didnt face any issue hence stopped the test :). Good that you were able to reproduce the error!

I think I have a fix -- it looks like occasionally (every 10K runs or so) we hit the explicit cancel() written in this specific test, before we hit the implicit cancel() due to the endofStream message being discovered.  I'm letting this run for a while before submitting a PR.  -This test also slows down in consecutive runs, which might indicate a leak but I'm hoping this is not the case.- (Edit: it's not, it was definitely an IntelliJ issue with conditional breakpoints).

I can't seem to _prove_ this is a fix yet, because both IntelliJ and standalone maven will eventually segfault when I try to run it 100K times with the changes.  I'm looking into it.

I am the [Flink Jira Bot|https://github.com/apache/flink-jira-bot/] and I help the community manage its development. I see this issues has been marked as a Blocker but is unassigned and neither itself nor its Sub-Tasks have been updated for 1 days. I have gone ahead and marked it "stale-blocker". If this ticket is a Blocker, please either assign yourself or give an update. Afterwards, please remove the label or in 7 days the issue will be deprioritized.


I don't think this JIRA is necessarily a blocker -- it looks like an error in the test that shows up as flakiness (as opposed to an error in the connector).  The above PR fixes the test, if anybody wants to take a look!

The "eventual segfault" that I noticed early happens before and after the fix, and is *very likely* a different error due to the {{MockStreamingRuntimeContext}} creating and not closing a {{MockEnvironment}}.  We could probably fix this, but it should never occur unless you try and run one of these tests 100K times!  What do you think?

This issue was labeled "stale-blocker" 7 days ago and has not received any updates so it is being deprioritized. If this ticket is actually a Blocker, please raise the priority and ask a committer to assign you the issue or revive the public discussion.


Hey [~jjayadeep], would you like to take a look at the [PR|https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-gcp-pubsub/pull/19]?  It's not likely that it's related to the version bumps, but there's a lack of eyes in the Pub/Sub area :D  Any review would be appreciated!

Hi [~rskraba] - I looked at the PR and tested it as well and it looks good to me.Â
