Added a patch that calls into state store and unit test that verifies after recovery state the new RM gets the reservations saved from previous RM.

Since updateReservation does an add and remove we do not have need to update reservation state in the state store. I can remove it if needed in either this or a separate patch.

failures are due to rebase with YARN-3656. Will update those new tests and submit a new patch

Updated patch to modify new tests to add valid ReservationDefinition thats required by the state store processing.

All the failed tests passed locally for me. Rerunning the tests

Thanks [~adhoot] for the patch. LGTM, just a minor nit - *TestSchedulerPlanFollowerBase::testPlanFollowerRecovery()* is not used so can be removed.

Kindly open a JIRA for removing _updateReservation_ from the State store as it's redundant.

Addressed feedback and opened YARN-4184 for removing updateReservation

Thanks for the patch [~adhoot] and the review [~subru]

I guess it looks pretty straightforward. Minor nit though :
* {{TestReservationSystemWithRMHA.testSubmitReservationAndCheckAfterFailover()}} uses explicit Thread.sleep to wait for the plan followers to synchronize. Is it maybe better to explicitly call ReservationSystem.synchronizePlan with the plan name and not have to perform a thread sleep and reduce possible test flakiness.

+1 pending your decision on the above.

Thanks for the review [~asuresh]. Attached patch removes sleep by adding the plan synchronization and a DrainDispatcher await needed to ensure the node capacity is added to the scheduler and to the plan capacity.

+1, pending jenkins

Added a retry since there are multiple events that we need to wait for. Draindispatcher await can return if we have drained the first event from the queue and the next event has not yet been added. So a simple await does not seem to work reliably. 

Reran the test multiple times without failure
