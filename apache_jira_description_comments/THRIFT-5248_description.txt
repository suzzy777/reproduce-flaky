Inspired by THRIFT-5214 and [this blog post|[https://github.blog/2020-05-20-three-bugs-in-the-go-mysql-driver/]] by proxy, I'd like to make Python's TSocket.isOpen() method check if the other end has closed the connection (using a non-blocking recv()). This will allow clients to discard disconnected sockets in connection pools before wasting time by sending a doomed RPC.
