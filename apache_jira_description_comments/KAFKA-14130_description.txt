While working on KAFKA-13877, I feel it's an overkill to introduce the whole test class as an integration test, since all we need is to just test the assignor itself which could be a unit test. Running this suite with 9+ instances takes long time and is still vulnerable to all kinds of timing based flakiness. A better choice is to reduce it as a unit test, similar to {{HighAvailabilityStreamsPartitionAssignorTest}} that just test the behavior of the assignor itself, rather than creating many instances hence depend on various timing bombs to not explode.

The scope of this ticket is to refactor the {{RackAwarenessIntegrationTest}} into a {{RackAwarenessStreamsPartitionAssignorTest}}.
