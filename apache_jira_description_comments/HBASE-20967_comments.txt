At least for this NPE in testLockLeakWithDelta, the problem seems to be that, the balancer is working and wants to move the region which is injected, and then cause all the RSes abort...

Maybe we should disable balancer in this test?

Hey [~Apache9], I pulled down today's master and was attempting to reproduce this issue but the test passes for me. Are you able to get it to fire the NPE?

No, it passes for me too... The flaky test finder will run the tests again and again, and it will fail finally... See the link in the description. For flaky test, typically we will push the patch first and then wait for several days to see if the test could fall off the flaky list.

Ok, thank you for the clarification [~Apache9]. What is the difference between the two environments (local and jenkins) that would cause this kind of behavior? Namely, tests passing locally but not on Jenkins. What is Jenkins doing differently?

The jenkins node will be shared by others so the resources are limited, and usually tests will spend more times to finish. It will be more likely to reproduce race on jenkins, comparing to our local environment.
