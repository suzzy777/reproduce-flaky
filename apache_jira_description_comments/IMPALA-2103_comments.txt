Duplicates IMPALA-2187. Keeping the other one because it has more details.

I don't think this was the pyc issue described in IMPALA-2187.  Unfortunately the logs are gone and I didn't save them.  But, looks like Casey has a change out that explains this one:

http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/613/

This failed again: http://sandbox.jenkins.cloudera.com/job/impala-CDH5-nightly-data-load/623/console

[~caseyc], do you think your change will fix this issue? If so, can you move forward with it?

Nope I guess there are two modes of flakiness for this test. My patch avoids an error about not being able to log an audit.

Seeing this again at:

http://sandbox.jenkins.cloudera.com/job/impala-cdh5.5.x-non-partitioned-hash-and-aggs/39/testReport/junit/Impala.tests.authorization.test_authorization/TestAuthorization/test_impersonation/

I thought this was a random failure, but this appeared twice in a row in non-partitioned-hash-and-aggs:

http://sandbox.jenkins.cloudera.com/job/impala-cdh5.5.x-non-partitioned-hash-and-aggs/40/testReport/Impala.tests.authorization.test_authorization/TestAuthorization/test_impersonation/

[~henryr], this is failing consistently on one of the 5.5.x builds. Could you take a look?

I'm running it now, overnight, to see if I can reproduce it. However, the error is that the test couldn't retrieve a query's profile, not that the contents of the profile are wrong (which is what is being tested). So I don't think it's too much to worry about. I'll know more if it fails overnight.

I've managed to reproduce it. What happens is that, for some reason, the python test can't retrieve the query's profile (no matter how many times it retries). What is weird is that the profile is available in the debug UI, which should be the same call. Next time I get it to retrigger I'll attach a debugger.

This is not a high-severity bug, in my opinion, but a flaky test.
