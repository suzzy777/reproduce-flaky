[~ableegoldman] Could I take over this issue?

Go for it. For some context, it seems to have started failing sometime in the last two weeks or so. But I'm not sure whether we actually merged something that broke this recently, or maybe Jenkins is just being extra-flaky these days.

[~ableegoldman] I feel you have resolved this issue by https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/2239004907b29e00811fee9ded5a790172701a03

the root cause is the in-flight records to changelog are not completed when closing streamTasks.
{code:java}
    @Override
    public Map<TopicPartition, OffsetAndMetadata> prepareCommit() {
        switch (state()) {
            case RUNNING:
            case RESTORING:
            case SUSPENDED:
                maybeScheduleCheckpoint(); //checkpoint is not up-to-date if there are in-flight requests
                stateMgr.flush();
                recordCollector.flush();
{code}
see [https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/03ed08d0d17a10ca4f96c8cc0a8694834ae01e6d/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/internals/StreamTask.java#L345]

The commit (https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/2239004907b29e00811fee9ded5a790172701a03) update the checkpoint after calling recordCollector.flush so the checkpoint is up-to-date.

Also, I loop StoreUpgradeIntegrationTest.shouldMigratePersistentKeyValueStoreToTimestampedKeyValueStoreUsingPapi 30 times with [https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/2239004907b29e00811fee9ded5a790172701a03]. All pass.


Huh, I didn't even notice that bug. It's just a happy accident that we fixed it in that PR.

Nice investigation! I think we can resolve this ticket then.
