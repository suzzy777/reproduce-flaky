I noticed yesterday that it seems to be failing to install a gem, and yet the earlier config has seemingly explicitly turned off building the ruby bindings, so it would seem it could perhaps also disable installing of the gem? I'd also be fine using a newer version instead though, as it isnt currently testing on 10.14 it seems.

Saw a weird failure when upgrading macOS version. The Travis job is on Linux, so it is unrelated to mac, and it is probably unreproducible, so I'll just post that Valgrind crash here

It's from a coverage build on Ubuntu Trusty (I'm a bit surprised that coverage build is running tests under Valgrind)

edit: it is not coverage build, I made a typo so -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage was not set.

26: Note: see also the FAQ in the source distribution.
26: It contains workarounds to several common problems.
26: In particular, if Valgrind aborted or crashed after
26: identifying problems in your program, there's a good chance
26: that fixing those problems will prevent Valgrind aborting or
26: crashing, especially if it happened in m_mallocfree.c.
26: 
26: If that doesn't help, please report this bug to: www.valgrind.org

26: In the bug report, send all the above text, the valgrind

```


The change seemingly disables building Go bits on 10.13, whilst it was enabled previously. It was only disabled on 10.12 because it required a newer version of Go.

 

Lets not include massive failure output (which doesn't even occur with the changes being made) in commit messages, its entirely unnecessary clutter. The Jira references are used in part to allow referring to such elaborated details.

Ok, I'll reenable go (I somehow thought the idea is to build it only once to save time, and because one of the tests is a bit flaky, I did not realize it is because of old go version) and put any further details to Jira.
