Does this fail consistently? It seems to pass in master. It could be a flaky test, but, first we'd have to rule out env issues in your setup.

yes, it is failing consistently for me, is there any patch already available which I might have missed?
What kind of environment issues possibly?

It's not failing in the Spark CI environment, which suggests the failure is specific to your env. You might try to debug to see why this is failing, but it's not clear this is a Spark issue.

As per worked and confirmed with [~amita-persistent], this issue is not from Spark CI envirnoment. Closing this JIRA.

Hi, All.
I found the case which makes this testsuite always fails.
If the user is `root`, the testcase always fails because `root` can access all files. I'll make a PR for this.
