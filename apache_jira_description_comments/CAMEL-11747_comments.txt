Ah okay it wants to fail with a bind error. Its maybe better to build a custom component with a consumer where you can make it fail on purpose.

There is also a bunch of other tests that use Jetty maybe they can use an in-house custom component instead so the tests are more reliable and also faster.

Yeah, make sense. 
Will add it.

I got the supervising test fixed. 

can we close this then ?

Yeah lets just close this
