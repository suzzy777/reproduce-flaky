[~ChrisEgerton] – Jenkins seems to be in very bad shape currently, and I did not get a single green PR build for a while – seems this test fails frequently. Would you have time to pick it up?

[~mjsax] Sorry, I've got a lot on my plate over the next couple weeks :( If this is still an issue by mid-January I might be able to take a look then.

 

I know [~gharris1727] has been doing some work on tackling flaky tests; perhaps he might be able to lend a hand?
