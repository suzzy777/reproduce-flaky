I started briefly looking at this. As an initial matter, our FindLLVM.cmake is inadequate. There's one (BSD-licensed) we can pull in from the LLVM-based D compiler: https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/blob/master/cmake/Modules/FindLLVM.cmake. If someone can point out another one, I can take a look.
