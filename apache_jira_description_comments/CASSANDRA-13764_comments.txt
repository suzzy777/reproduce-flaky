This also affects {{SelectTest.testMixedTTLOnColumns}}.

[~slebresne] says he's ok with ninja'ing this in, but in case you ( [~jkni] ) want to review before I do it (I need to push for Circle anyway just to be safe, so this'll sit here until Circle gives me a green run):

3.0: https://github.com/jeffjirsa/cassandra/tree/cassandra-3.0-13764 (Circle: https://circleci.com/gh/jeffjirsa/cassandra/tree/cassandra-3.0-13764 )
3.11: https://github.com/jeffjirsa/cassandra/tree/cassandra-3.11-13764 (Circle:  https://circleci.com/gh/jeffjirsa/cassandra/tree/cassandra-3.11-13764 )
trunk: https://github.com/jeffjirsa/cassandra/tree/cassandra-13764 (Circle: https://circleci.com/gh/jeffjirsa/cassandra/tree/cassandra-13764 )

The idea looks sound to me - I think you need to remove the TTL column from the select [here|https://github.com/jeffjirsa/cassandra/commit/a1e49db69622de11a996d09105e5ebf3b54c58c3#diff-7f5981228f9d9428fb164aa91316aa85R2976], as you did in {{testMixedTTLOnColumnsWide}}. If you agree, I'm comfortable with you doing that on commit and don't need to rereview if CI looks good.

Thanks Joel.

Committed to 3.0 as {{67ac1496cc9e7d9d15be28b9536e9cdbce42473d}} and merged to 3.11 and trunk WITHOUT adding CHANGES.txt entry, because it's just a test fix and never hit a release (not quite a ninja).
