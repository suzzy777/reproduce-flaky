It seems the test has been renamed (just a few days ago) to {{CorruptedSSTablesCompactionsTest}}.

I pushed up [a PR|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/638] that approximates the 2.2 version. (There have been a number of other changes to {{CorruptedSSTablesCompactionsTest}} since then to fix other kinds of flakiness.) The only downside I can see to following through w/ this is that if we leave things as they are and there's another failure, we'd know exactly which seed broke things.

After a bit more digging, it seems like the seed used in the failing case above (9823169134884L), only triggers failure on {{cassandra-3.11}} and {{trunk}}. For some reason, it doesn't affect {{cassandra-3.0}}.

So {{CorruptedSSTablesCompactionsTest}} was inserting rows with invalid {{LongType}} partition keys (i.e. keys with length 1, rather than 0 or 8). That wasn't really a problem by itself, but the seed {{9823169134884L}} somehow generated some duplicate clusterings, and when {{DuplicateRowChecker}} is notified of the partition closing in {{onPartitionClose()}}, it [tries to print|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/transform/DuplicateRowChecker.java#L93] a human-readable partition key, which of course fails validation. Simply fixing {{CorruptedSSTablesCompactionsTest}} to generate valid partition keys seems to solve the problem.

{{SASIIndexTest.testInsertingIncorrectValuesIntoAgeIndex}} is already failing in {{cassandra-3.11}}, as reported by CASSANDRA-15881.

LGTM. [~marcuse] any thoughts?
