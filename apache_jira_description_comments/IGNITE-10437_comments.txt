[~SomeFire],

Can you please explain what was the reason of the problem and how your patch fixed it?

[~ilantukh], I suppose because of delay, threads worked separately, one by one. With high delay there was more often situations when overflow doesn't happened. With lower delay overflow happened is more often, but test still was flaky. So, I removed delay to be sure that overflow is happened.

[~SomeFire], It seems to me that your patch doesn't solve the issue, but just reduces it's probability. I would prefer to re-write this test (and GridCacheTestStore if necessary) to ensure that overflow always happens. For example, you can insert CyclicBarrier or CountDownLatch into GridCacheTestStore.write method to make all Flusher threads stuck, or you can put data in test in a *while* loop until overflow happens.

Good idea, I'll do it.

[~ilantukh], I made loop as you suggested. Tests are ok.

Thanks, looks good now.

Thanks, [~SomeFire], merged to master.
