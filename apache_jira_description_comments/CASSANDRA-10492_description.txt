2 dtests for the storage engine upgrade on the 2.1->2.2 path fail:

http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Upgrades/job/storage_engine_upgrade_dtest-21_HEAD-22_tarball/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/

(If there are 3 failures at that link, don't worry; one was a dtest bug that's been fixed.)

{{upgrade_tests/cql_tests.py:TestCQL.large_count_test}} flaps when a TRUNCATE operation times out:

{{upgrade_tests/paging_test.py:TestPagingWithDeletions.test_failure_threshold_deletions}} also fails on this upgrade path:

These are in the same ticket for the moment, but if one becomes a longer project, it should be broken out into a separate ticket.
