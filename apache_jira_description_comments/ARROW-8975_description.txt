The gRPC MacOS tests have been flaking again.

Looking at [https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/20311] they may possibly have been fixed except [https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/13856] reports they haven't (in some configurations?) so I will try a few things in CI, or just disable the tests on MacOS.
