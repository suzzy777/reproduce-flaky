In HBASE-8329 we added a throughput controller for compaction, to avoid spike caused by huge IO pressure like network/disk overflow. However, even with this control on, we are still observing disk utils near 100%, and by analysis we think this is caused by flush, especially when we increase the setting of {{hbase.hstore.flusher.count}}

In this JIRA, we propose to add throughput control feature for flush, as a supplement of HBASE-8329 to better control IO pressure.
