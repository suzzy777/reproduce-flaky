The following test cases for the C++ native client are flaky:

PartitionRegionOpsTest.getPartitionedRegionWithRedundancyServerGoesDownSingleHop

PartitionRegionOpsTest.putPartitionedRegionWithRedundancyServerGoesDownSingleHop

 

They fail very often when run in CI although I have not seen them fail when executed manually.
