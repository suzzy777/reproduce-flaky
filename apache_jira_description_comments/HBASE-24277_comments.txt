branch-2 is much more stable. There are a lot of test failures (some 100% failure rate) in master.

I think there is only one test in master which fails 100%? It is TestRemoteBackup, not sure who can help fixing it. Another high failure rate test is TestZooKeeper...

Hmm not sure what was changed but a few days ago I checked the flaky test dashboard and TestDelegationTokenWithEncryption and TestGenerateDelegationToken were failing 35 out of 35 runs. (HBASE-24240)

The flaky dashboard is good. Resolve.
