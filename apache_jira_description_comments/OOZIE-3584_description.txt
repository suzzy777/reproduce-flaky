_Current bug_
 *=========*

There is a sub workflow run in independent mode that runs a fork action which contains two (or more) actions.

These actions inside the fork action run in parallel mode, and they have some seconds delay in between them.
 If a parameter is passed to one of these actions, that cannot be resolved, then it changes its status to FAILED, and also the workflow’s state to FAILED. The other action’s state which are not started yet will stuck in PREP state forever. The correct behaviour would be to KILL the remaining actions as well as the workflow.
 Note: this bug only occurs when it is run in independent mode. If it has a parent workflow, then the parent workflow will kill this workflow after 10 minutes because of the callback process.
