Seems really strange, and nothing to do with the specific tests. The failing commands are:
{code:java}
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS `test_db_smb_mapjoin_7` CASCADE;
USE default;
{code}

So this is most probably not the failing tests themselves, but some infra or general test problem with the {{TestBeeLineDriver}} which manifested by this failure.

I did not disable the tests because it failed due to some other reason rather than test specific. I do not know how to get the test logs. The artefacts created contains only surefire-reports not other logs.

[~pvary], Should I close this jira?

We can just run a flaky test check on this test, to see if it is failing. If not, then I think we can close.
