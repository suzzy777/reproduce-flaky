Although the flakiness for the {{MirrorConnectorsIntegrationTest}} has (hopefully) been addressed by https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9698, the root cause (unclean worker shutdown during those tests) has still not been addressed. This suggests that users of MirrorMaker 2 will see {{ERROR}} -level stack traces when shutting down workers running MM2 (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/a57486e75084d70f1fbf22df9d3ffc3462302add/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L301-L304), which looks fairly alarming, and may even indicate some problems with the functioning of MM2 itself.

It'd be nice to diagnose the root cause of these unclean worker shutdowns when running MM2 during these tests and address them via improvements to the test cases, improvements to MM2 itself, or both.
