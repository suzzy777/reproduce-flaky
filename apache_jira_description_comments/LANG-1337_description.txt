From the 3.6 thread RC2. We had issues in the release. Two tests failed. One of these tests happened on IBM JDK 8, and was related to time zones. Gary Gregory quickly pointed that the very latest IBM JDK 8 released did not had this issue.

Indeed, I grabbed a JDK 8 from IBM and had this issue, and then after looking for the latest version, I had only one test failing. This test in question was ToStringBuilderTest#testReflectionHierarchyArrayList.

Debugging the test in Eclipse, with the JDK pointing to IBM JDK 8 (and taking care to not let the Eclipse maven integration change it), there is a part of the code that receives an ArrayList object to create a String with reflection.

In Oracle JDK 7, the object contains the default 10 empty positions, and thus the generated String is.

{noformat}
java.util.ArrayList@761a4a3d[elementData={<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>},size=0,modCount=0]
{noformat}

But with IBM JDK 8, the ArrayList is empty, nada, and then I get the following in the Eclipse debugger.

{noformat}
java.util.ArrayList@761a4a3d[elementData={},size=0,modCount=0]
{noformat}

The test is - as commented in LANG-727 - a bit flaky. However, the expected string assumes ArrayList will have an initial 10 null values. So the pull request in this issue simply creates an ArrayList with 10 initial capacity :-) a na√Øve approach, but that I believe fixes this test.

The changes in the pull request linked to this issue have all tests passing with the following set-ups:
