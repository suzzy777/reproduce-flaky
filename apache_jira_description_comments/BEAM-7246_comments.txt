Shehzaad, is this something you hope to work on in the near future ?

 

If so, appreciate if you can provide a rough design. Existing Java connector should serve as a good example.

Probably you can use the client library here: [https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-spanner/]

Chamikara, Yes - I’m hoping to have a design shared soon. The Java implementation will be the inspiration - (like most Python stuff in Beam!) Thanks for the pointer.

[~altay] Trying to see how to connect to Spanner from Python SDK. Unfortunately I am a bit stuck here.

Can you please point me out how do you guys provide credentials to google cloud services from Python SDK

For example, I am trying 


{code:java}
from google.cloud import spanner

spanner_client = spanner.Client()
{code}
This code assumes that there is an environment variable *GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS* is set which in my case is not.

I tried to download *credentials.json* file from GCP and provided that credentials file in my code. That gaves me 403 permissions error on spanner.create operation.

Thanks

 

[~raheelkhan] just checking, are you still blocked on this?

[~altay] No, I have got a working service account. So far so good ! Thanks

[~shoaib-vd] has this been released into the lastest Beam version? I see the PR has been merged but I don't see it in any release notes.
