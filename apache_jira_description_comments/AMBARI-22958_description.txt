Apache Rat 0.12 can automatically exclude patterns from SCM ignore files ({{.gitignore}} in Ambari's case) from its check.  See RAT-171 for details.

Benefits:

# No need to duplicate the exclude information in the {{apache-rat-plugin}}'s configuration.
# Improved run time for non-clean workdir, since it can exclude everything under {{target}}.
