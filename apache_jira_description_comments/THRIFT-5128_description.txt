These are TFrameTransport related issues from THRIFT-5125.

Â 
 # _TFramedTransport.flush_ is not called anywhere; therefore, the message is never sent. _outProtocol.transport.flush_ should be added to generated processors after _outProtocol.writeMessageEnd_, and also after writeException.
 # _TFramedTransport.remainingBytes_ are not reset anywhere, thus the header of second and further messages are not processed properly
 # _TFramedTransport.flush_ incorrectly checks if buffer >= headerSize (got there by incorrectly porting code COCOA lib)
 # _TFramedTransport_ does not read the whole message from the underlaying transport at once (that I understand is the whole point of TFramedTransport)

Notes:
 * 1. needs compiler changes
