Could we call `KafkaStreams#cleanup()` before we start the application to make sure the is no dirty state? Might be simpler than randomizing the state directory? Or maybe use different application.ids (even if this has this drawback, that we might get overlapping id if we are not careful.)

I guess your proposal would also work. However, I guess your proposal would be harder to maintain, because using a randomized path is a environment setting that can be done once for all (or at least a bunch of)  system tests whereas {{KafkaStreams#cleanup()}} needs to be called in each Streams application. Every person that adds a test need to know/remember to add  {{KafkaStreams#cleanup()}}.

Maybe not a big deal because the same Streams application code is shared by multiple tests. Just wanted to point out the difference.
