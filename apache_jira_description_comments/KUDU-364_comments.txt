This is the second time we've seen this error (first one was back in May). The only interesting thing of note here is that 18446744073 is 2^64 / 1000000000 - 1. I'm betting it's some Linux bug.

http://poige.livejournal.com/520776.html has some discussion of the same issue (in Russian). http://ccl.clozure.com/irc-logs/sbcl/2011-11/sbcl-2011.11.25.txt has an IRC log of some people discussing it.

Seems the best thing is probably to do a workaround where we check for this particular bogus value and call getrusage again, in hopes that it would return a non-bogus value the second time around.

Is this fixed now?

I haven't seen it in a while -- guessing it was a Linux kernel bug and we've mostly been running on newer kernels in the last few years? Let's close as Cannot Reproduce and someone can reopen it if we see it on the flaky test dashboard.
