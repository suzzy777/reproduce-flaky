I'll take a look at this, it looks like this is due to the s3 eventual consistency issues.

IMPALA-8189: Disable flaky scanner test on S3

TestParquet::test_resolution_by_name in test_scanners.py is flaky
due to eventual consistency semantics of S3. It makes sense to
disable this test temporarily since it is not S3 related. In the
long run, the eventual consistency issue would have to be fixed
either by using S3Guard or by modifying the S3Client.
