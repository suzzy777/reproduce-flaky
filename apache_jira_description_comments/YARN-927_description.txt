The downside is having to use more than 1 container request when requesting more than 1 container at * priority. For most other use cases that have specific locations we anyways need to make multiple container requests. This will also remove unnecessary duplication caused by StoredContainerRequest. It will make the getMatchingRequest() always available and easy to use removeContainerRequest().
