https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/674307298 failed with:

{noformat}org.apache.fineract.integrationtests.ClientLoanIntegrationTest > testLoanScheduleWithInterestRecalculation_WITH_REST_DAILY_INTEREST_COMPOUND_INTEREST_FEE_STRATEGY_WITH_OVERDUE_CHARGE FAILED

    java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at ClientLoanIntegrationTest.java:3841{noformat}

This cannot be due to the removal of the un-used {{TimeZone.getTimeZone(tenant.getTimezoneId());}} in {{fineract-provider/src/main/java/org/apache/fineract/infrastructure/core/service/DateUtils.java}} (for FINERACT-826) in https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/755/files, but is a "flaky" integration test.

There have been issues about this before (FINERACT-7, FINERACT-453, FINERACT-708, FINERACT-709, FINERACT-820), but they are all closed, so I'm opening a new one, as this problem clearly still isn't solved.

FINERACT-820 says "is flaky and always fails on Sundays", and https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/674307298 ran and failed today on a Monday 11 AM CET (CH) time = Mon Apr 13 14:05:12 IST 2020, so this may be something else?

FINERACT-723 has something interesting that may be related to this? Even though in https://github.com/apache/fineract/blob/develop/.travis.yml#L42 we set {{export TZ=Asia/Kolkata}}.
