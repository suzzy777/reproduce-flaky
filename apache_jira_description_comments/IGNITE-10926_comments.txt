I have prepared [PR|https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/5820] with reproducer to fix the issue. I used the watcher for the local alive node. It resolve case when the node was deleted after several cluster restarts.

Another way for resolving the issue was using a special event to invoke reconnect. But this requires creating a new discovery event because a custom event will not be processed (rtState isn't joined). 

[~sergey-chugunov], could you take a look at the issue, please?

[~NSAmelchev],

I reviewed the patch and it looks reasonable for me.

The only thing that bothers me is that semantics of RECONNECT event was weakened: if earlierÂ the event was fired only if client node has finished joining process, but now it is fired always when client restores its connection to the cluster.

[~agoncharuk], do you think it may cause any issues?

[~sergey-chugunov] [~NSAmelchev] So with this patch it is possible to receive {{RECONNECTED}}, then {{NODE_JOINED}} for a local node?
I do not think it is troublesome in any way for Ignite code; however, for an end-user this may be counterintuitive, is it hard thing to fix?

[~agoncharuk] No, the order of these events will not be changed. 

The difference is only for the case when client join request wasn't handled between cluster restarts. (Wasn't be joined to topology in previous connect retry)

In the master: after several cluster restart the client join will fire only the {{NODE_JOINED}} event and will not fire the {{RECONNECTED}} event. 
In the fix: after several cluster restart the client join will fire the {{NODE_JOINED}} and the {{RECONNECTED}} events.


This is a tricky question. I think the {{RECONNECTED}} event should be triggered if the cluster detects client node failure and then re-join. Since in this case the whole cluster is restarted, either way looks ok, but I would still prefer having only one {{NODE_JOINED}} event.

I have fixed PR. Now reconnect event will fire if the client node was connected to a previous topology.

Also, I have found that flaky authentication test was broken and correct my changes. 
Before failing local node I check on join errors. And for minor optimization, I moved the initialization of the client node watcher to the join error watcher that starts after a timeout. 

[~sergey-chugunov], Could you take a look at the changes one more time, please?

[~NSAmelchev],

I reviewed patch one more time, it looks good to me as client node now fires RECONNECT event only after a successful join.

I suggest to remove {{Ignore}} annotation from tests {{testReconnectServersRestart_1}} and {{testReconnectServersRestart_2}} as they should be fixed by this change. If so we may even close related ticket IGNITE-8178.

Thank you for your contribution!

[~sergey-chugunov], Thank you for review. 

I looked at these tests and they fail not only by this reason if run several times. After this fix, I'll back to this related ticket.

[~dpavlov], Could you help with a merge, please?

Merged to master.

[~ivan.glukos] thank you for picking up this merge.
