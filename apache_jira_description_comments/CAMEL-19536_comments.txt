I am going to work on itÂ 

Thanks for your contribution! I assigned the ticket to myself to prevent others from claiming it - as it cannot yet be assigned to you.

I reached out to [~nstefeko] about this. She is busy with other business matters, so she won't be able to work on this ticket. I am unassigning and leaving it available for anyone willing to work on it.
