[~pcmoritz] [~robertnishihara] do you know what might be going on with this? Is the file too big for the VM maybe?

Here's an intermittent macOS stall that's been happening too: https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/311538093#L1912

Thanks for filing the issue, I hope to get to this over the weekend. Traveling at the moment.

I moved this off 0.8.0 as it's unclear if it's essential for the release

Haven't been seeing this lately. Moved off 0.9.0

Thanks, please point it out if you do see it.

We're starting to see some flakiness on Linux in Travis CI, not sure what is going on -- here is a hang from a recent build

I also saw a failure in {{test_use_one_memory_mapped_file}}, I'll try to link to one here if it occurs again

Here's another recent build failure https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/335236215/log.txt from https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/335236215

Another stalled build on master https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/builds/335320562

Not clear this is related to Plasma, actually, so I'll create a new JIRA

See ARROW-2062, sorry for the false alarm here

I was able to get this error locally

Starting the Plasma store fails with

{code}
(Pdb) plasma_store_name, self.p = start_plasma_store(use_valgrind=os.getenv("PLASMA_VALGRIND") == "1",use_one_memory_mapped_file=use_one_memory_mapped_file)
Allowing the Plasma store to use up to 0.536871GB of memory.
Starting object store with directory /dev/shm and huge page support disabled
../src/plasma/store.cc:744 Check failed: pointer != NULL
{code}

This happened when I tried reducing the amount of memory available to the Plasma store by default in 512MB 

I don't think we have seen intermittent plasma failures in a long time, at least on Travis-CI. Should this issue be kept open?

These issues seem to not be occurring lately
