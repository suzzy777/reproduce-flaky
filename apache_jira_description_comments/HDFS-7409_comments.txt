Trivial patch attached. I'm not sure how often both of these counts will hit zero on a real cluster, but it's at least an improvement in the user experience when it can happen.

[~mingma] this is basically the approach you recommended with looking at the pending and under-replicated count. I'm also looking into maintaining that block list too, as it's a stronger solution.

Thanks, [~andrew.wang]. The patch looks good. For the "maintaining DECOMMISSION_IN_PROGRESS blocks" work, I was about to open a jira for that, but feel free to go ahead and we can continue the discussion in the new jira.

This message is automatically generated.

The patch looks pretty good to me, though the test timeout is mildly concerning. I just ran it locally with this patch applied and it passed, though.

I'm +1 on the patch, but Andrew, would you mind looking into the test failure just a bit? Has it been timing out in other builds recently as well?

Thanks folks.

Thanks for reviewing ATM. I checked in the full test log, and just see this:

{noformat}
Running org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.TestBlocksWithNotEnoughRacks
Killed
{noformat}

Maybe this is attributable to our ongoing Jenkins flakiness. I ran this a few times locally as well and it worked okay, so I'll go ahead and commit.

Committed to trunk and branch-2, thanks again for reviewing Ming and ATM.
