jackson has a whole bunch of CVEs open against 2.9.x, which makes working with HIVE in security aware environments quite difficult.

This has been fixed in HIVE-23338 already, but since 4.0.0 hasn't been released yet (and is not on the horizon, as far as I can tell), this should be backported to {{branch-3.1}}.
