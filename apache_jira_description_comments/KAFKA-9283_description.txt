This same test fails occasionally on when run in Scala  2.12.10 but has been failing consistently in Scala versions 2.13.0, 2.13.1.

Needs review.

Also, I had to adjust the scalaVersion variable in the gradle.properties config file to the target version in my environment before it was picked up in the integration test
