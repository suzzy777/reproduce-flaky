At first I thought we only would need the latest build of the flaky job finder. But the more I think about it, if we don't keep any old flaky reports then there's no way to find out how a branch has been doing for flaky failures over time.

I'd rather see if there's a way we can bring down the per-build size or at least keep the report HMTL since that only appears to be ~30KB.

I'm getting more detail from infra on what space is being used. Something is amiss because a given job should have < 40KB of artifacts. With a retention of 30 builds and 6 branches that's less than 10MB. I think fixing this disconnect is a better use of time then eliminating the job history.

Do we really care the history? For me, after a fix, usually I will check the flaky list for several new builds and if there are no failures, I will assume the problem has been fixed. I've never checked the history...

For the nightly build, only 10 is needed? As the find flaky test job only check the latest 10 build result.
