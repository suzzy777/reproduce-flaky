By a quick look at the diff the patch looks good.

I tend to view this issue in context with a group of other issues like SUREFIRE-131, SUREFIRE-530, SUREFIRE-526, SUREFIRE-632, SUREFIRE-561, SUREFIRE-528, SUREFIRE-701, SUREFIRE-582.

I'm not saying we need to solve all of these issues, not even that the relationship is close; but they seem, to be touching on the same feature set. I think we need to discuss what features we need/want to implement for this cluster of issues as a group rather than adding features piece by piece without an overall plan.







Sounds reasonable to me. I'll try to extend what I've already got to allow specifying exclude/include patterns as -D properties, at the very least.

Shouldn't this be closed as duplicate to SUREFIRE-726 ?

This patch was applied (includesFile, excludesFile), so I am wondering that this issue is open.
