Right now we have 3 different implementations of repair: normal, preview, and incremental (IR); all 3 handle RepairJob failures differently and offer different state cleanup.  To make sure that we consistently handle errors the same way and cleanup, we should move these responsibilities outside of the repair task itself and move these into common APIs and move some logic into the repair coordination its self.

This work relates with CASSANDRA-15399 as special handling each task makes the work more complex.
