Or better, use the EnvironmentEdge correctly.

Patch for 0.94. Uses EnvironmentEdge instead.
The change to Store.java is not needed, but good to have.

[~apurtell], FYI

I assume you pinged me to pick this up for trunk [~lhofhansl], so that's what I will do. :-)

Looks like trunk already has a change like the patch on this issue.

Arghh. Should've looked there first.

This was fixed a while back with HBASE-6832. IncrementingEnvironmentEdge is a bit different trunk.
I'll commit by patch to 0.94. Thanks for looking [~apurtell]

Committed to 0.94 only (similar was added in 0.95, so all other branches have it)
