Looks like it is some problem with newly added TC agents and not with referred ticket.

[~vveider] do you have any idea on what is going here? Is it possible to ssh into those agents to check?

Those are new Windows agents, that possibly have some bottleneck in disk subsystem.
Help in investigation why tests fail is welcome.
