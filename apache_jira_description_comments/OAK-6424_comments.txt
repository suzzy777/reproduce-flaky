[~flakycov] Can you attach the target/unit-test.log file? This test relies on some async behaviour and uses a timeout of 30 secs. So on very very slow setups it may trip. Having access to unit-test.log would be helpful to see if this is the condition

Looks like this was due to recent changes done for OAK-6432. I have done another fix which should make test stable. Would watch CI behaviour for next few runs

Resolving as fixed given build is passing now

Bulk close for 1.7.4
