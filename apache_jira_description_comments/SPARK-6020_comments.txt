Hey [~andrewor14], I think [PR #4835|https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/4835] has already fixed this PR. {{InMemoryColumnarTableScan}} uses accumulators to generate debugging information for testing purposes. Test failures related to this JIRA ticket showed that accumulator updates got lost nondeterministically, which was also exactly what PR #4835 fixed. Also, according to [your amazing statistics sheets|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSCTXLBqnglk0XMd0R4IhvUPb2MEDQUaRNwxcHBtSlk/edit#gid=52877182], this test suite hadn't been flaky for a week.

Ok, I will close this as resolved for now. We can always reopen it if it's flaky again. Thanks Josh.
