Raised to P1 based on https://beam.apache.org/contribute/jira-priorities/

Seems that the logic that moves files to "claim" them for a batch import in FhirIO.Import sometimes is trying to copy a file that has already been deleted.

For sake of explanation (and refreshing my own memory) the FhirIO.Import works as follows:
# Buffer elements in a bundle to a new line delimited JSON file in the tempDir
# Group these files into batches (of 10,000 files) this is to avoid many load jobs if batches were small
# Copy each batch of files to a unique sub temp dir lets call it a batchDir (this is used to specify a prefix + wildcard for each load job) in [ImportFn|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/healthcare/FhirIO.java#L1033-L1040]
# Start load job and block til completion (deletes the files in the batchDir [here|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/healthcare/FhirIO.java#L1051] and the corresponding files in the orignal dir [here|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/healthcare/FhirIO.java#L1065])
# Delete all the (original) files in the tempDir once the window is closed (based on this [usage of Wait.on|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/healthcare/FhirIO.java#L840-L870])

Background on why this logic was so complicated in this review [thread|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11339#discussion_r423357007]

The flakiness seems to occur when attempting the copy in step 3 on a file that does not exists. My hunch is that the deleting in step 5 may not be properly waiting on the ImportFn to be complete.

Could this happen if the ImportFn task is rescheduled for a particular batch?

FYI I do not have bandwidth to dig deeper into this / fix this right now and [~lastomato] has taken over maintenance of these IO connectors as I am not currently engaged w/ Healthcare customers.

Unfortunately I don't have free cycles to work on it this week, is it possible to disable the test temporarily?

The tests have been running smoothly for ~3 days now, marking this as fixed. Please reopen if further failures are observed.

Thank you!

Thank you!
