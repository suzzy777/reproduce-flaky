The test tries to compare the query plan for exact match including file size.
However, when impala writes parquet file, it adds impala version string to the end of file.
Different impala version will cause the different file size and test failure.

|--03:SCAN HDFS [tpch_parquet.region r]
|     partitions=1/1 files=1 size=895B

|--03:SCAN HDFS [tpch_parquet.region r]
|     partitions=1/1 files=1 size=900B

We should probably just ignore the file size in result check.
