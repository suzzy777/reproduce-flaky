There are some tests, which were probably meant to run during build, but does not follow .*Test.java or *IT.java filename pattern.

 

This returns 46 files on current master (output attached):
{code:java}
grep -rnw './camel' --include=\*.java -e '@Test' -l | grep -v -e '.*Test.java' -e '.*TestSupport.java' -e '.*TestBase.java' -e '.*IT.java'
{code}
This method is not bulletproof and returns some false-positives, but most of the matches should be IMO renamed to follow filename patternt and thus be executed during maven build.
