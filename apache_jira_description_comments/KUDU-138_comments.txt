This is an issue even in non-distributed mode when there are multiple tablets. I think I'm seeing the following behavior which is responsible for linked_list-test failing sometimes:

- user inserts some row into tablet A, which gets assigned timestamp 10
- an insert happens on some other tablet B (eg timestamp 20)
- machine crashes before a flush
- on bootstrap, the tablet B bootstraps first. This sets the tserver clock to 20
- when we bootstrap the tablet A, and replay that operation, it is assigned a new timestamp (21) and written into the MRS. However, the current code reuses the old commit message so the log still says timestamp 10.
- the TS then flushes, and so it ends up with an UNDO delta deleting at timestamp 21
- TS crashes again
- TS restarts, and bootstraps A first. We don't replay the edit, because it has already been flushed. When we finish bootstrapping, we update the clock with the highest TS we saw in the log (10)
- If we do a scan now, we end up scanning at TS 10, but the UNDO delta has TS 20, so we don't see the row :(

hum tricky scenario, seems completely possible though.

Alex, you haven't started on this, right? I'm getting other linked-list-test failures and I want to fix this one to see whether they all go away or not.

http://gerrit.ent.cloudera.com:8080/2770 has some hacky patch to fix it, but not quite right

from HipChat:

wouldn't it be as simple as allowing a txn to specify it's own timestamp? soemthing like StartTransactionAt(Timestamp timestamp) and enforcing that, when doing this, timestamps must be monotonic?

yea, guess that makes sense

see also http://gerrit.ent.cloudera.com:8080/?l=94#/c/2827/2/src/tablet/tablet_bootstrap-test.cc for a case where we have a weird test workaround which may be related to this issue.

David is working on this but not quite done yet (need to trim state on the MVCC manager)

this was fixed in http://github.mtv.cloudera.com/CDH/kudu/commit/0c80dee58d0337e54d4687672d710a5054e997ed

Tests got super flaky after committing this, so we ended up reverting parts 3, 4, and 5 of this JIRA. Re-opening for a second attempt.
