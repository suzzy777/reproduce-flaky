Currently when a server with region replica crashes, when the target server is created for the replica region assignment there is no guarentee that a server is selected where there is no other replica for the current region getting assigned. It so happens that currently we do an assignment randomly and later the LB comes and identifies these cases and again does MOVE for such regions. It will be better if we can identify target servers at least minimally ensuring that replicas are not colocated.
