I can see failures for 3.0 as well:
 * [https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-3.0-cqlsh-tests/301/#showFailuresLink]
 * [https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-3.0-cqlsh-tests/302/#showFailuresLink]
 * [https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-3.0-cqlsh-tests/306/#showFailuresLink]

Similarly to CASSANDRA-17386 the issue is reproducible locally and seems to be fixed in [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/bf9a1d487b9ba469e8d740cf7d1cd419535a7e79].

I'll backport necessary changes to 3.0 branch.

 

The fix seems to be working locally. Kicked of CI and raised a PR.

Nice, +1.

Merged as [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/d17b16c9b1bf3e325d415b3777c2a7bd24c764ce.] Thanks for quick review!

Congrats on being guinea pig #1. :)

I doubt a test fix ticket is going to give rise to any of those "1 of 38" failures below, but worth the basic visibility to author / reviewer.

> I doubt a test fix ticket is going to give rise to any of those "1 of 38" failures below, but worth the basic visibility to author / reviewer.

Nice report! I feel these changes are not related to the test failures because the idea of the fix is to port some changes from 4.0 to 3.0/3.11. So nothing in 4.0/trunk has been actually changed (apart from _CHANGES.txt_ file).

Is 38 a typo? I can see 12 failures only.

That's "1 failure of the last 38 runs".

 

Maybe I should revise it to read "1 in 38" instead?

No, I feel "1 of 38" is clear as well. I just misread your original message, sorry for confusion.
