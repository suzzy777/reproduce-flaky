Can you provide a reproducible project?
It does not really happen in older versions?
Do you use {{parallel}}?

[~tibordigana] - i can't provide a reproducible project unfortunately.
Nor can I comment about other versions.

But what I observed was that this usually happens when there are a lot of logs to copy to the report.

[~tibordigana] Im having the same problem with my project (using 3.0.0-M5). It only happends when there are a lot of log entries and when the test is a retry after fail.
Another thing I found: With the parameter -DforkCount=0 the problem doesn`t happens. The report is generated as expected.

Unfortunately I also cant provide a reproducible project...

We cannot do anything without having a reproducible project. Please, do so and import it in Jira.

We can count only some guess.
The POM which executes this test is in multi module project? Is it the last module when the build ends?
You can contact me on the email. I guess you can find it.

Reproduced with 3.0.0-M5.
Not reproducible with 3.0.0-M6-SNAPSHOT.

This issue was fixed in SUREFIRE-1945.
