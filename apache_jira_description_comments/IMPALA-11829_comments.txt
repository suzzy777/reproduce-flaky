The test failure is caused by this change [https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/18829/]   This IMPALA-7942 change added support for a TABLE_NUM_ROWS query hint which can be used to specify a table cardinality for cases where stats are missing or invalid. In the case where stats were missing or invalid and no TABLE_NUM_ROWS hint was specified by the user, HdfsScanNode.getStatsNumRows is incorrectly returning a default value of -1 instead of returning a rough estimate of cardinality as it had prior to the IMPALA-7942 change.

Fix is up for review: https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/19421/

IMPALA-11829 - Fix bug in cardinality estimates related to TABLE_NUM_ROWS hint

IMPALA-7942 added support for a TABLE_NUM_ROWS query hint which can be used
to specify a table cardinality for cases where stats are missing or invalid.
In the case where stats were missing or invalid and no TABLE_NUM_ROWS hint was specified
by the user, HdfsScanNode.getStatsNumRows was incorrectly returning a default value of -1
instead of returning a rough estimate of cardinality as it had prior to the IMPALA-7942 change.
This change fixes the return value of getStatsNumRows so it only uses the TABLE_NUM_ROWS
value when the users has actually specified the query hint.
