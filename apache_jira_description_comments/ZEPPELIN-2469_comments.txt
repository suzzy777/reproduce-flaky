The failures seem to occur because the "yarnCacheDir"  directory is not created. I have added code to create the directory before the absolute path is stored in yarnCacheDirPath. The test case passed upon making this change. 

Thanks [~pravindsilva] for the patch. Zeppelin project uses github pullrequest for review and merge patch.

    @pravin-dsilva Thanks for the contribution. 
    
    To enable jenkins, you have to setup your own travis for your zeppelin fork repository.

    We also need to enable the `HeliumBundleFactoryTest` on CI by removing it from `-Dtests.to.exclude` variable in `.travis.yml`
