[~poojanilangekar], can you see if this is related to IMPALA-7367? It might have changed the memory requirements of this statement.

Yes, I hit the issue while testing IMPALA-7367. I think the limit I set may not be accurate. I will take a look at this.

IMPALA-7873: Fix flakiness in TestExchangeMemUsage

IMPALA-7367 reduced the memory requirement of the query tested in

Testing:
Ran the test 100 times in a loop without any failures.
