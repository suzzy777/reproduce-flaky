   The failed unit test is unrelated to the change. This is another issue.

   Hi @ayushtkn , could you please take a look? Thanks.

   Sorry for the delay, LGTM. @tomscut , since the PR is a little stale (21 days from last update), can you merge/rebase? Would be good to get a recent Yetus run as well. Assuming all looks good, I can help merge this.

   The failed unit test is unrelated to the change. It also failed in other PR https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/5135. Seems flaky.
    




xkrogen commented on PR #4201:
URL: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/4201#issuecomment-1322464405

   `TestLeaseRecovery2` indeed seems to be broken; I confirmed that the behavior is the same before/after applying this PR. Merging to trunk. Thanks for the contribution @tomscut !
