The procedure followed for rack mapping is ambiguous.

Due to same host name the mapping of nodes to rack was not as per our requirement.

In slower systems all nodes gets mapped to the latter rack2 and in little fast system one node gets mapped to rack1. Thus leading to test failure since now the rack fault tolerance comes into existence.Which can not be satisfied by this ambiguous mapping.
