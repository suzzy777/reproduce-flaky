The goal of this ticket is to implement the necessary changes in the gateway sender to prevent that events belonging to the same transaction are spread across different batches. In other words, to ensure that events from the same transaction are sent inside the same batch.

This will be an optional feature on gateway senders to be enabled via a new parameter (--group-transaction-events) and will be restricted to serial gateway senders with just one dispatcher thread or to parallel gateway senders.

Apart from the above restriction, grouping of events for a transaction inside the same batch may only be attained if the regions to which the events belong are replicated by the same set of gateway senders with the --group-transaction-events flag enabled. If this condition is not met, the events will be correctly delivered by the gateway senders but it will not be guaranteed that all events will always be sent inside the same batch.
