    IGNITE-10017: Fix for infinite loop with 3rd party persistency, keepBinary and no value for the key.

----


Looks like using the same _preparingForCache_ we use to put the entry solves the problem with access the map entry properly.

Seems it is not related to _withKeepBinary_ parameter. Attached the reproducer.[^IgniteGetBinaryKeyReadThroughSelfTest.java]

Looks like flaky tests only.

GridCacheMapEntry started using prepareForCache from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-4932

[~roman_s] Thank you for contribution. I've reviewed your changes. Could you please add the reproducer to your PR to prove that changes work well? Re-run tests and then get the green visa from TC Bot here [mtcga.gridgain.com|https://mtcga.gridgain.com/] . After all, steps are done and green visa appears, I'll merge your changes to master.

Ran {{IgniteCacheAtomicProtocolTest#testPutReaderUpdate1}} several times locally. Looks like flaky. TC says so too.
Same for others. [~Jokser] Could you possibly recheck?


[~roman_s] Thank you for update.
I think this happened because of outdated branch state. You've branched a month ago, many things changed from that time.
You should merge fresh master to your branch and re-run tests again.
I also noticed that you forgot to add reproducer to a test suite. I think IgniteCacheTestSuite will be the appropriate place for that.

[~Jokser] Yes, indeed, I forgot to add to the suite. Thank you!
Added and merged with the master. Ran the bot.
