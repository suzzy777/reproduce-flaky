IMPALA-6947: Kudu tests flaky due to rpc timeout

Some Kudu tests occasionally fail due to hitting an rpc timeout when
running on a heavily loaded machine. For normal operation, having a
low timeout is good for noticing issues quickly, but for tests there's
no real reason we can't set this higher to avoid flakiness.

This patch adds a flag, -kudu_client_rpc_timeout_ms, disabled by
default. It also sets -kudu_client_rpc_timeout_ms to 60s for ASAN in
start-impala-cluster.py, higher than Kudu's default value of 10s.

Testing:
- Passed a full run of core tests on ASAN.

IMPALA-6249: Expose several build flags via web UI

Exposes a list of build flags via the impalad web UI. The build flags
can be viewed on the root page under the "Version" section. They can
be accessed via other tests through the debug version of the root page
(e.g. adding &json to the URL). The build flags are listed in a JSON
array so that they can be parsed easily. This should help run Impala
tests against a remote Impala cluster.

The build flags are read in CMakeLists.txt and then stored in
preprocessor variables.

Three build flags are exposed as part of this commit:
- Is_NDEBUG = [true, false]
    - Whether NDEBUG was true or false at compile time
- CMake_Build_Type = [DEBUG, RELEASE, ADDRESS_SANITIZER, TIDY, UBSAN,
  UBSAN_FULL, TSAN, CODE_COVERAGE_RELEASE, CODE_COVERAGE_DEBUG]
    - The value of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE at compile time
- Library_Link_Type = [DYNAMIC, STATIC]
    - Derived from the compile time value of BUILD_SHARED_LIBS

There are a few other minor changes that are apart of this commit:

* The patch modifies environ.py so that it supports fetching build metadata
for both local and remote clusters.

* The tests under the tests/webserver directory were not being run because
'webserver' was not whitelisted in tests/run-tests.py. This patch fixes
that and addresses several test failures in run-tests.py.

* It reverts part of IMPALA-6947 so that their is no dependency from
start-impala-cluster.py to environ.py. The timeout discussed IMPALA-6947
is now set at compile time.

Testing:

Added new tests to webserver/test_web_pages.py to ensure that the build
flags are being set. Some tests are only run when run against a local
cluster because we have no way of getting the build info from a remote
cluster, whereas local clusters contain a .cmake_build_type file.
