Observed here: https://jenkins.mesosphere.com/service/jenkins/job/mesos/job/Mesos_CI-build/2399/FLAG=CMake,label=mesos-ec2-debian-8/testReport/junit/mesos-ec2-debian-8-CMake.Mesos/MasterTest/RegistryUpdateAfterReconfiguration/

The test here failed because the registry contained 2 slaves, when it should have only one.

Looking through the log, everything seems normal (in particular, only 1 slave id appears throughout this test). The only thing out of the ordinary seems to be the agent sending two `RegisterSlaveMessage`s and two `ReregisterSlaveMessage`s, but looking at the code for generating the random backoff factor in the slave that seems to be more or less normal, and shouldn't break the test.
