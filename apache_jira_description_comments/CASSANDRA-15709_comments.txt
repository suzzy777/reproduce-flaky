I'll try and reproduce - it's possible this is some unlucky scheduling on an otherwise busy machine. 

If it helps I use the following to slow things down https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-15650?focusedCommentId=17064073&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17064073. 

I saw this with HIGHER configs and Marcus saw it with HIGHER configs, so slowing down may not be desirable; sharing mostly as a FYI if it helps

patch mostly LGTM.  I am currently testing to see how flaky it is before/after.  

Without limiting resources I was able to cause it to fail quickly, running with your patch now.

Been running in a loop for awhile without issue.  Most of my comments are small or nits, so assuming you resolve them I am +1

update looks good, +1

[~djoshi], [~dcapwell], is there anything else we are looking for in this one?
Or only a committer? (I know David is not a committer, same as me :D ) 

I can commit it if this is reviewed and ready.

I think it's good to merge, as long as you're happy with it and a +1 from a non-committer is acceptable.

It just needs these two commits merged (fixup on the second) and the commit message updated to record David as the reviewer and you as the merger.

I'm happy to do the squash/fixup comments and force-push up to the review branch if you'd like

+1

Committed. Thanks for the patch [~jmeredithco] and [~dcapwell]!
