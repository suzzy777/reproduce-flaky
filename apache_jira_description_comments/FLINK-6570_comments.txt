    Please note that the only change in this PR is a documentation change. Not sure why this should result in test failing. How can another test run be requested (a _flaky test_ perhaps)?

    Sadly, our tests are a little bit unstable. The issue is not related to your change.
    
    @tillrohrmann could you talk a quick look here?

    Better to do `TRY_ADDRESS_RESOLUTION` here so that we fail fast in case the JM is not reachable from the node we are currently running on.

    Thanks for your contribution @gosubpl. Changes look good to me. Merging this and addressing my comment while doing so.

1.4.0: 85e281be3835fe8bb0a5bcaede072e5f26b7f087
1.3.0: a30a8be98c4a7416e4621c48e961dd8a802b56b4

actually, this issues still persists:

1) there still is one {{QueryableStateClient client = new QueryableStateClient(config);}} in the doc
2) the example uses {{TestingUtils}} which is only available to Flink tests

Can you open a pull request to fix it?
