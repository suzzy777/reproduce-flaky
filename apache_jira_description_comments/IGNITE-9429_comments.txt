Merged to master.

[~agoncharuk], seems we can miss some bugs with catching
IllegalStateException for all datastructures. I see only one problem
in this test - {{G.allGrids()}} returns unordered list, so we should
change:
{code:java}
if (circular)
    stopGrid(G.allGrids().get(0).configuration().getIgniteInstanceName());
{code}
to
{code:java}
if (circular)
    stopGrid(idx - gridCount());
{code}

This will fix flaky failures and preserves the idea of "circular" node stopping.
