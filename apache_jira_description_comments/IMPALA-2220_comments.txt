Not S3 specific, see IMPALA-2582 for another repro.

I think this is more likely a generic "sometimes metrics doesn't refresh quick enough" sort of thing rather than something specific to the data-source code, but I don't know for sure.  (I think we've seen this symptom on other test failures where the metric value didn't reach the expected value even though it should have according to the state of the system.)

Matt, this test has been failing pretty frequently. Could you take a look?

Yeah, I think I found a problem with the test code that explains this. Posting a review now.

    IMPALA-2220: Fix flaky test test_create_drop_data_src

    Test was failing occasionally when the impalad returned by
    ImpalaCluster.get_first_impalad() was not the same impalad
    as that which the test class's self.client was connected to.
    This now uses the ImpaladService created on the base class
    to ensure it's the same impalad as the impalad that the
    client is connected to.
