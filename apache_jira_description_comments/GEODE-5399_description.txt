Based on discussion on the dev list, we want to completely remove the flaky category.

We should
* Run all flaky tests and establish which ones are still failing (GEODE-5371). Update the associated JIRAs
* Remove the Flaky category from all tests marked as flaky
* Remove the flakyTest target from gradle
* Remove the FlakyTest job from the concourse pipeline.
