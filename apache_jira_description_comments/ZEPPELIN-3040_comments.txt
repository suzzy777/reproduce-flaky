    ZEPPELIN-1977. spark 2.1 uses a more recent commons-lang3
    
    ### What is this PR for?
    The issue is that spark 2.1 use `commons-lang3` 3.5 while `zeppelin-interpreter` use 3.4. We can not just upgrade `commons-lang3` to 3.5, as it just make spark 2.1 work, but would fail other versions of spark. This PR remove `commons-lang3` from zeppelin-interpreter. We should keep zeppelin-interpreter's dependencies as minimum as possible. We can remove other dependencies (like `commons-lang`) from `zeppelin-interpreter` in a followup PR.

    [ZEPPELIN-1994] bugfix of streaming output.
    
    ### What is this PR for?
    If you run the following code, then streaming output doesn't work properly from the second run.
    ```
    %spark.pyspark
    import time
    print("1")
    time.sleep(2)
    print("2")
    time.sleep(2)
    print("3")
    time.sleep(2)
    print("4")
    ```
    This problem comes from the order of `paragraph update` event timing and `paragraph update-append` event timing is incorrect.
    and This PR will fix also https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1833 too.

    DepInterpreterTest will use random temporary folder for repo
    
    `DefaultRepositorySystem.resolveDependencies` throws NPE at line 352
    if `ArtifactResolutionException` is thrown during `collectDependencies`.
    Artifact is found but it is impossible to download it (for example folder
    can't be created)
    
    I think the reason is that several tests use "local-repo" folder for repository.
    While one test tries to download artifact, another deletes repository
    (or some another distructive thing)

    [ZEPPELIN-1983] Feedback about success/failure when interpreter is re…
    
    ### What is this PR for?
    When a interpreter is restarted, there is no feedback to user whether the action is received/honoured by zeppelin. This might also lead them to click restart multiple times, before they realize it has taken affect.
    Also fixed a null bug.

    ### Todos

    ### What is the Jira issue?

    ### How should this be tested?
    Restart a interpreter to test the positive case. The message should disappers on its own after sometime if not closed. A simple way to test the negative case is to stop the server and then try restarting.
    
    ### Screenshots (if appropriate)
