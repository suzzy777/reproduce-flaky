Test failure [here|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/jkni/job/jkni-9510-3.0-testall/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.service/QueryPagerTest/multiQueryTest/].

It's on a 3.0 branch for a issue, but the patch only affects the implementation of the {{assassinate}} command and wouldn't affect this unit test.

The assertion failure is in the construction of a Group of SinglePartitionReadCommands, where the value of {{nowInSec}} for each command does not match.

I'm not sure if 1) this invariant isn't valuable, 2) this invariant is valuable but the unit test does not accurately reflect how a group would be created, or 3) this is a genuine bug.
