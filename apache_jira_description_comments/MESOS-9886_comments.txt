commit 1f6a3134ee30aa9a3e963ca775ba92fc3f619960
Author: Benjamin Mahler <bmahler@apache.org>

    Fixed the flaky RoleTest.RolesEndpointContainsConsumedQuota test.
    
    When this test was run as root in CI, the --launcher gets implicitly
    set to `linux` whereas it gets implicitly set to `posix` when run
    as non-root. When run as `linux`, the use of cgroups causes the
    agents to detect each other's containers as orphans and kill them.
    
    The fix for now is to force the launcher to be posix.
