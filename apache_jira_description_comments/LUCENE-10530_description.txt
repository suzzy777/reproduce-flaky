TestTaxonomyFacetAssociations.testFloatAssociationRandom seems to have some flakiness, it fails on the following random seed.
{code:java}
./gradlew test --tests TestTaxonomyFacetAssociations.testFloatAssociationRandom \Â 
-Dtests.seed=4DFBA8209AC82EB2 -Dtests.slow=true -Dtests.locale=fr-VU \
-Dtests.timezone=Europe/Athens -Dtests.asserts=true -Dtests.file.encoding=UTF-8 {code}
This is because of a mismatch in (SUM) aggregated multi-valued, {{float_random}} facet field. We accept an error delta of 1 in this aggregation, but for the failing random seed, the delta is 1.3. Maybe we should change this delta to 1.5?

My hunch is that it is some floating point approximation error. I'm unable to repro it without the randomization seed.
