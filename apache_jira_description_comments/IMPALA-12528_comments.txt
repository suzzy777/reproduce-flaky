IMPALA-12528: Deflake test_hdfs_scanner_thread_non_reserved_bytes

Prior deflake attempt at IMPALA-12499 does not seem sufficient. There
are still sporadic failures happening in
test_hdfs_scanner_thread_non_reserved_bytes. This patch further attempt
to deflake it by:
- Injecting 100ms sleep every time scanner thread obtain new scan range.
- Running it serially.
- Skip it in dockerized environment.

This patch also fix small comment mistakes in hdfs-scan-node.cc.

Testing:
- Loop and pass the test 100 times in local minicluster environment.

Commit 9f50b5d2395e8789e2af0d67379a07f7355560c3 in impala's branch refs/heads/master from Riza Suminto

IMPALA-12528: (addendum) test non-reserved bytes against parquet

test_hdfs_scanner_thread_non_reserved_bytes is still flaky due to the
inconsistent number of data files of tpch_text_gzip.lineitem table
created during data loading. This patch further deflake this test by
changing its target table to tpch_parquet.lineitem. This table is
selected because it consist of 3 parquet snappy files, which in turn are
consistently planned as 1 scan range per file. This also raise the delay
injection from 100ms to 500ms.

Testing:
- Confirm that tpch_parquet.lineitem always populated with 3 parquet
  snappy files in HDFS minicluster by repeating the following command:
  ./bin/load-data.py -f -w tpch --table_formats=parquet/none \
    --table_name=lineitem
- Loop test_hdfs_scanner_thread_non_reserved_bytes 100 times against
  HDFS and OZONE.
