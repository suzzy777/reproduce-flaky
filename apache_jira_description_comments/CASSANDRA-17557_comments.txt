[Trunk pach|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...ekaterinadimitrova2:17557-trunk?expand=1] | [J8 CI|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1548/workflows/72d0120b-cccc-44bd-b013-f7bc5eaf589c] | [j11 CI|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1548/workflows/92fcf8f7-b9e3-41bf-b607-69f454709add]

There was some issue with J11 on J8 unit tests, one container has failed but I cannot see what test failed and no results were stored, as it does normally.

I reran the suite, and everything finished successfully [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1548/workflows/72d0120b-cccc-44bd-b013-f7bc5eaf589c/jobs/10100/steps].

The compression unit tests also have two failing containers without being able to identify which tests failed. Restarted [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1548/workflows/72d0120b-cccc-44bd-b013-f7bc5eaf589c/jobs/10101] 

The rest of the failures are known ones:

test_oversized_mutation - CASSANDRA-17456

utests_system_keyspace_directory - CASSANDRA-17489

I didn't run upgrade tests as those parameters were added as a patch committed only to trunk. 

[~benedict] , as agreed in Slack the other day, please, review :) 

Thanks Ekaterina. I think there are two mistakes here in the original patch: the inclusion of an unnecessary property, and the failure to utilise a necessary property. The repair rpc timeout was intended to be kept, and utilised for both standard repair verbs and paxos repair verbs since if either fails due to transient slowdown it creates a lot of additional pressure on the system.

I have pushed my suggested variation on this patch [here|https://github.com/belliottsmith/cassandra/commits/17557-trunk]

Thanks, I rebased your branch and pushed a new CI run: [J8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1566/workflows/393c8917-1d44-41be-afec-8ab6a97b7ede],  [J11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1566/workflows/23ff50bf-a946-4097-b6d6-d624983c932c] - pending results, just started it. 

From config perspective looks good, I guess for the Verb class change someone more familiar with your latest work than me should say. [~barnie] or [~ifesdjeen] maybe? 

Did a quick skim, seems to me all are known failures. I will double check with their respective tickets on Monday

Gave this a look at Benedict's request. Everything looks fine except for the change to read repair timeouts. Since those are part of a client query, and aren't part of any repair process as intended by this patch, I think they should be reverted to writeTimeout.

🤦‍♂️

[~benedict] if you two are aligned on the change around the second parameter, do you think you can take over to finish this, please? 

Hi Ekaterina,

I have a long weekend here, I'm afraid. I can get to this on Tuesday.

I wish I knew that yesterday when we discussed you will check it with Blake and commit.

I am swamped today and it will need final check before commit. 

CC [~mck] as he is planning to cut a branch around the 1st, for awareness.

I hope it is not an issue that we will remove a not released parameter later. Otherwise, it will have to be deprecate it and keep it. 

Or the release can be delayed by a day.

I don't think it is fair to delay it. 

What I can suggest is I commit now the removal of the unused parameter and then you can fix the bug around the other one as not an API change. 

There is no requirement to cut a release on the 1st, only the freeze (and, I think, branch creation) has been agreed to take effect then? I would think we would want to merge all known outstanding bug fixes beforehand anyway.

But I don't really have a strong feeling either way. If it helps at all, I have pushed the necessary change Blake pointed out, so this patch is ready to commit modulo CI.

The branch will be cut on the 1st, but that just makes it bugfix-only, and this ticket is a bug, so while I would strive to have these things squared away sooner, I think it's okay to wait in this instance too. 

Well, freeze means to me no more API changes, that is what I was told. Otherwise, definitely no release before voting, etc. I am even personally not sure whether it will be alpha or beta, I guess we will get to know next week when discussions start :) 

I will try to run CI later and if it looks good (no new failures) commit if that is fine with you and [~bdeggleston] . Thanks for pushing the patch

Ops, seems our comments crashed [~brandon.williams] :) 

Applied the patch to 4.1 and trunk and just submitted CI. Commit pending CI:

basicRangeTombstonesTest[Incremental] - It didn't manage to reproduce, I guess it is super rare and unrelated?

Seems like flaky test on the current 4.1 that requires a ticket.

Managed to reproduce _forceWithDifference_ in the same class with the same error, there is a ticket opened for that one. Not 100% sure wether we can just link them. 

 

[~benedict] , please, let me know if you have any concerns around those failures or we can commit it. Thanks

I just opened a ticket for _org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.InternodeEncryptionEnforcementTest_ before I forget - CASSANDRA-17618

All sounds fine to me Ekaterina, thanks.

There were new commits so I had to rerun CI but luckily there were only two flaky known tests failing on trunk, 4.1 all green.

   9e49a2b21d..e0247d6833  trunk -> trunk

I need to update this script to check across all branches for a failure; all but test_dead_sync_participant are failing on trunk as well so should have a > 1 count on failures.

test_dead_sync_participant looks like it might be flaky on 4.1 based on the butler data; strongly doubt it's related to this ticket; looks good on ASF infra relative to this work here.
