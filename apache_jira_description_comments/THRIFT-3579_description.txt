1300+ tests with recently added SegFault detection, make cross on Travis-CI fails too often.
Ideally every flaky test should be listed and tracked but it's more important to clearly indicate deterministic failures that is being introduced.

This changes make cross to retry up to 3 times and if any retry has happened, the test case is listed in "flaky" section but does not affect return code of make cross.
