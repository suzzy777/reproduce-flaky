Failed again with the same exception in this PR: https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Jackrabbit/job/oak-trunk-pr/job/PR-617/1/testReport/junit/org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.segment.spi.persistence.split/SplitPersistenceTest/oak_segment_azure___testChangesAreLocalForSplitRepository/

I think this and other tests using a Docker Azurite image fail because builds on Apache CI can run concurrently on one worker and multiple Oak modules run tests with the same Docker container name 'oak-test-azurite'. See also other reports in OAK-8015 or OAK-8073.

Proposed changes in https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak/pull/859 add a random suffix to the container name to prevent clashes when multiple Oak modules are built concurrently on the same Jenkins worker.

Merged PR into trunk.
