The JCQueueTest is flaky

[ERROR]   JCQueueTest.testFirstMessageFirst:61 We expect to receive first published message first, but received null expected:<FIRST> but was:<null>

The issue is that the test has a race condition. There is no check that the consumer thread has read all (or any) of the produced messages before the test terminates.
