Not related to embedded server start, because in Achilles the start is synchronous with a countdownLatch and a timeout of 30s and there is not timeout exception in the stacktrace.

Might be related to port 9042 already in use (for example for casssandra embedded Haddop tests). Will try to get the dynamic port set by Achilles or set with a free port if I cannot get the port back from Achilles)
