 

After merge  LeaderState::checkLeadership(), some test case become hard to pass under GitHub CI, such as GroupManagementBaseTest and TestMultiRaftGroup.

Such case need do node restart operation or membership change operation, which will make leader vulnerable, especially resources is limited.

Current walk around is to enlarge election timeout a little bit, e.g., from [150ms,300ms] to [300ms, 600ms], because larger election timeout will make leader become more stable.

 

TODO:

1) do we have better way besides changing election timeout ?

2) are there other test cases affected by LeaderState::checkLeadership() ?
