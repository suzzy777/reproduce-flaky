Adding robertwb to confirm this isn't something weird related to his change, but also because I don't know a good owner 

That PR looks unrelated, but Emily best way to verify would be to start a new PR reverting the change an run the post commit test on the PR. [~emilymye] - could you do that?

I looked at a job in Dataflow console (https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow/jobs/us-central1/2021-07-29_00_29_27-14542241127462572812;step=s3;bottomTab=WORKER_LOGS;expandBottomPanel=true;logsSeverity=ERROR?project=apache-beam-testing) and there are no other obvious warnings or errors.

[~mbae] recently added these tests (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14806) - He might be a good owner.

I started it on https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15251

Doesn't seem related to the PR. This test weirdly has now passed a few times for Python 3.8, but seems overall to still be failing, so it might just be very flaky?

[~altay] [~emilymye] I will take a closer look.

[~altay] [~emilymye] I think I know the issue: the test is trying to create a CatalogItem, but will throw an error when the item already exists. I would propose adding clean-up functionality to the test that also deleted the CatalogItem again after successfully running the test. What do you think?

That makes sense to me! I prefer having cleanup so we don't accumulate catalog items we aren't aware of, but it may make sense to also add a timestamp before the random int or something similar to avoid future collisions. I can go ahead and also clean up some of the existing data.

I've sickbayed the failing test for now. 

If the problem is duplicate items, we will need to clean up the existing items, in addition to cleaning up new items we create as we go.

Also, the error message is "Failed assert: [['17393']] == [[]]". This doesn't really tell us what is going on. So we should somehow log failure information in the test as well (it looks like the library already handles failures, but I can't seem them in the test results).
