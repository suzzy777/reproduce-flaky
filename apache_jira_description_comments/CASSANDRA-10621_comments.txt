[~jkni] here is the system.log

Thanks, Alan.

This error is thrown when a node is bootstrapping and is streamed a mutation that affects a MV base table and the token of the view partition key is not owned by the bootstrapping node.

It was not caught in dtests because the base table and view table always had the same value for the partition key in writes, so there was always a pending node for the view token.

I've pushed a fix as well as changes to the dtests to better detect similar issues. I've also added a dtest for write survey mode. I'll update once CassCi has results.

[~jkni] I tested the patch and the bootstrap works well now. Thanks!!

Thanks for checking that, Alan.

I've looked at the CassCI results from the patch; for the most part, they're the usual flaky suspects.

There are two atypical failures: [testTriggerMinorCompactionSTCSNodetoolEnabled|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/jkni/job/jkni-10621-testall/1/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction/CompactionsCQLTest/testTriggerMinorCompactionSTCSNodetoolEnabled/] and [testWrongChecksumLastLine-compression|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/jkni/job/jkni-10621-testall/1/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.db.lifecycle/LogTransactionTest/testWrongChecksumLastLine_compression/].

These both pass locally in a tight loop and appear to fail because of race conditions in the tests.  The failures are in unrelated subsystems.

As a result, I think this is ready for a look, [~carlyeks].

These seem to correspond to the {{STARTING}}/{{JOINING}} operation modes that StorageService can be in; do any of the [other modes|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/4beb54da50752fdd5573d8d1d2b0da108eaded6c/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/service/StorageService.java#L237] require special attention?

These definitely correspond to {{STARTING}} and {{JOINING}} operation modes; we also need to handle {{MOVING}}, which the previous patch did not handle.

Since explicitly handling these operation modes seems considerably clearer than trying to handle side effects of these transitions, I've reworked the patch to explicitly check the operation mode of StorageService.

I've checked these patches against the proposed dtest changes [here|https://github.com/jkni/cassandra-dtest/tree/mv-tests].

The CI runs are clean relative to 3.0
