[~maedhroz] Would it be reasonable to target this for 4.0.x?

[~cscotta] I know this has been a potential problem for years (and certainly before 4.0), but I'd like to try to throw a patch together first to see if it's as simple as I think it is. If I don't get around to it by the end of the month, I won't argue against pushing it to an early 4.0.x release.

Thanks for the patches!

The test (added in the patch) can easily produce the race w/o applying the patch. 

The patch makes sure 'ringVersion' is guarded by read/write lock accordingly in all the code paths. 

+1 on all branches. 

 

The patches also look good to me. It seems that the bug also affects 2.1 and 2.2. I'm not sure if the bug is critical enough to go in 2.1, but probably we should apply it to 2.2 even when we are very close to its end of support with 4.0 release. The patch seems to apply cleanly to older branches, we'd only have to be careful to replace the lambda function in the test by a classic anonymous class. wdyt?

(Note: Not sure what happened to {{testDateCompatibility - org.apache.cassandra.cql3.validation.entities.TypeTest}}, but it almost certainly doesn't have anything to do with this patch...)

Excellent, +1

The only really interesting test failure I can see is [mixedModeReadColumnSubsetDigestCheck - org.apache.cassandra.distributed.upgrade.MixedModeReadTest|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/maedhroz/cassandra/213/workflows/1fe56afa-08d6-4925-9fe0-1f2c5c58b2b0/jobs/1172]. Throwing up a rerun [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/maedhroz/cassandra/213/workflows/8b236d60-7c4b-4ab4-a4d3-24f864564416].

[~adelapena] Mind starting a Jenkins run against these branches? Otherwise, seems like we're ready to commit.

+1 on the patch to 2.2.

The failed tests from CI do not look related to the patch. Some failed tests are known flaky and have tickets opened. I am also unable to reproduce the failure from testDateCompatibility and I agree that the test has nothing to do with the patch.

Sure:
