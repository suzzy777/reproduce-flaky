Locally and on Jenkins, I've frequently seen this test fail:

{code}
Error Message
The await method on Waiter timed out.
Stacktrace

See for example https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-2.7/6057/testReport/

There aren't obvious errors or problems with the test. Because it passes sometimes, my guess is that the timeout is simply too short or the test too long. I'd like to try reducing the number of threads/batches in the test.
