This synchronized block is protecting {{lastSentTime}} which is a native long.  Can use AtomicLong and remove this synchronization.

{code}
  synchronized boolean packetSentInTime() {
    long diff = Time.monotonicNow() - lastSentTime;
    if (diff > maxSendIdleTime) {
      LOG.info("A packet was last sent " + diff + " milliseconds ago.");
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
