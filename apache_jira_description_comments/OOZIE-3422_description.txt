When the Oozie client tries to connect to the server and fails the error message is not always helpful.

$ oozie jobs -oozie http://thisisawrongurl

It is not enought to print out the {{getMessage()}} of the {{Exception}}, we should also print out the full stack trace in the {{ConnectionRetriableClient}} class.
