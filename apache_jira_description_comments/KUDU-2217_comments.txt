That's interesting. This implies that we have a config change op 1.3 which has its "new_config.index" set to 2 instead of 3. It seems, though, that whenever a pending op is added in AddPendingOperationUnlocked, we are forcing the new_config().index() to match the op index. Maybe we can add a DCHECK into the code that checks the above invariant when committing a change config and try looping this test?
