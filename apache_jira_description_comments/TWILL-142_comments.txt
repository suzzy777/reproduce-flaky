    (TWILL-142) Add longer time for timeout in EchoServerTestRun to check whether the restart successful.

    Bump up the timout for stopwatch to wait until all containers have been restarted.
    
    With new feature in TWILL-116 being committed, the EchoServerTestRun test become bit flaky due to
    sometimes the mini cluster could not allocate new containers in current proposed timeout which is 30s.
    
    Also fix logging for the test to log info when you get different set of containers instead of error.
    
    Run test with Travis without the change 5 times we got 2 error because of container id same in EchoServerTestRun restart test.
    
    With the fix, run 12 times Travis build and 100% NO error in the EchoServerTestRun restart test.
