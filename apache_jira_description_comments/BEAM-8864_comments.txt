We expected to see two records [1] and two records were written to BQ [2]. So this is possibly a timing issue.

 

[1][https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/big_query_query_to_table_it_test.py#L74]

[2] [https://pantheon.corp.google.com/dataflow/jobsDetail/locations/us-central1/jobs/2019-12-02_10_15_03-14204280782580035511?project=apache-beam-testing]

Seems like verify query returned zero results.

[https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Python35/1123/testReport/junit/apache_beam.io.gcp.big_query_query_to_table_it_test/BigQueryQueryToTableIT/test_big_query_legacy_sql/]

apache_beam.io.gcp.tests.bigquery_matcher: INFO: Read from given query (SELECT fruit from `python_query_to_table_1575309894232.output_table`;), total rows 0

 

Seems like output table is just named "output_table": [https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/big_query_query_to_table_it_test.py#L87]

 

So probably this test will be flaky in the presence of multiple test suites since one test suite could clean up the output table while another is running it. [~boyuanz] , have we considered randomizing output table name ?

 

 

Each test case has its own randomized dataset id. My suspect is that there is some latency between writing to table and querying from data again. Maybe consider adding another retry logic: retry if getting empty response here: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/738e5912e2d2e09bd58ee1241350f8f3c7e8e7b2/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/tests/bigquery_matcher.py#L101?
