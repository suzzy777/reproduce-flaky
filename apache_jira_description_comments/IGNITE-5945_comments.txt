I have fixed the issue.

The test was failing because of not finished rebalancing. So the following situation could have happened: we have got primary keys for a *srv0*, but after rebalancing primary keys move to *srv1*. And a blocking of *GridDhtAtomicNearResponse* message on *srv1* don't take effect.

So I just have added waitForRebalancing() *exactly in the same way* as it works in GridCacheRebalancingSyncSelfTest#testSimpleRebalancing().

You can see on TC 120 runs of this test with 3 other which is affected by my change, one of them was flaky too.
The last run on TC shows suite passing with final changes.

This fix looks good to me.

Looks good to me too.
