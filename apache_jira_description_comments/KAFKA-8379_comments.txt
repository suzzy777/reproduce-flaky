URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6753
 
 
   The test starts an AdminClient with a MockClient. After the admin client network thread had started, it was disconnecting one of the nodes and marking it unreachable from the main thread. This interferes with the admin client network thread, causing a timing issue if the disconnect occurred while the network thread was processing the first metadata request. This PR makes the test safer by marking the node unreachable in MockClient before starting the admin client.

[~rsivaram] and [~ijuma], this is happening frequently when trying to build on the `2.2` branch:
{code}
org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.KafkaAdminClientTest > testUnreachableBootstrapServer FAILED
    org.junit.runners.model.TestTimedOutException: test timed out after 120000 milliseconds
        at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)
        at java.lang.Object.wait(Object.java:502)
        at org.apache.kafka.common.internals.KafkaFutureImpl$SingleWaiter.await(KafkaFutureImpl.java:92)
        at org.apache.kafka.common.internals.KafkaFutureImpl.get(KafkaFutureImpl.java:260)
        at org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.KafkaAdminClientTest.testUnreachableBootstrapServer(KafkaAdminClientTest.java:276)
{code}

Can this be backported to the `2.2` branch?
