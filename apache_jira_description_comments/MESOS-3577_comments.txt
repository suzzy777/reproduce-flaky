[~anandmazumdar] thanks for filing! It's really helpful to include both good and bad output in the description. Makes it easier to see where the failing case went wrong. Please help me encourage others to do this when filing test failures :)

Fix is here: https://reviews.apache.org/r/39025/

Also, while looking into this test, I noticed that this test takes some time (> 1 second) to run. It turns out that this is because when a connected framework has a failover, it does not go through {{deactivateFramework}} and {{activateFramework}} in the allocator (which would trigger an immediate allocation). Rather, all filters remain untouched in the allocator and the allocation only takes place during the next batch allocation cycle. I'll file a ticket for this.

Filed MESOS-3587 to capture the bug that slows down the test.

    Fixed a flaky oversubscription test.

    The expectation needs to be added before it becomes possible
    for the estimation to make its way to the master.
