I'm really sorry about that, [~milleruntime]. I'm happy to revert and re-apply if you'd like to have the proper attribution via the author on the commit.

No worries. If its not too much trouble, I do get some satisfaction seeing it show up on my profile.

No trouble at all. Revert-ed ï»¿d23676dc3698d2ca6084b17cd4326b43dbcec41c and re-applied in 064ae0aa70e8b132fc3c8dde9792ce8a4b1f4094 with correct authorship.

Not a bad birthday present, thanks!
