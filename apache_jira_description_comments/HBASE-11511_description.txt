We used to write COMPLETE_FLUSH event to WAL until it got removed in 0.96 in issue HBASE-7329. 

For secondary region replicas, it is important to share the data files with the primary region. So we should reintroduce the flush wal markers so that the secondary region replicas can pick up the newly flushed files from the WAL and start serving data from those. 

A design doc which explains the context a bit better can be found in HBASE-11183.
