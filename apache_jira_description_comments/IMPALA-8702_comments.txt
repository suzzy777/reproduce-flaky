Thank you for pointing this out. I have updated our PlannerTest.testJoins() (at [https://gerrit.cloudera.org/c/13717]).

Commit c9937fd99a3a0f52124797374da76a9d2d25f650 in impala's branch refs/heads/master from Fang-Yu Rao
[ https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=impala.git;h=c9937fd ]

IMPALA-8702: Remove the PlannerTestOption of VALIDATE_CARDINALITY to avoid a flaky test

Removed the PlannerTestOption of VALIDATE_CARDINALITY in testJoins()
and testFkPkJoinDetection() to avoid checking the estimated cardinality which
may be slightly different each time due to IMPALA-7608 when an hdfs table
without stats is involved in a query.
