The Flight Java tests had been disabled in CI because they are flaky. There is some kind of memory teardown race condition that causes non-deterministic failures

Hit this a couple of times today. It seems to be worse during peak hours of the day suggesting it occurs when systems are under high load

Happened again: https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow/jobs/491886996

Has failed on me several times in the last week

I tried to replicate locally with various method (lowering timeouts, forcing high system usage) without success. I will disable the test for now.
