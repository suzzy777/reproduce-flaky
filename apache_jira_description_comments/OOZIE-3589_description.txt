Code is [here|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/a40ab5361372aa73c9e4aa386a9c81bd21742aa4/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/command/wf/ReRunXCommand.java#L213]. 

I don't think you should use the {{copyActionData}} method in a {{for}} loop. Just call it externally.

Fixed like:

{code:java}
for (int i = 0; i < actions.size(); i++) {
            // Skipping to delete the sub workflow when rerun failed node option has been provided. As same
            // action will be used to rerun the job.
            if (!nodesToSkip.contains(actions.get(i).getName()) &&
                    !(conf.getBoolean(OozieClient.RERUN_FAIL_NODES, false) &&
                    SubWorkflowActionExecutor.ACTION_TYPE.equals(actions.get(i).getType()))) {
                deleteList.add(actions.get(i));
                LOG.info("Deleting Action[{0}] for re-run", actions.get(i).getId());
            }
        }
copyActionData(newWfInstance, oldWfInstance);
{code}
