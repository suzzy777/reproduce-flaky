Appy's dashboard for 2.0 https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests-branch2.0/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dashboard.html and a GCE run last night showed how bad of a state our unit tests are in on tip of branch-2. This issue does triage fixing and disabling so I can push out the beta-1. Its done as a subtask of HBASE-19694 because a few of the tests were broke by this commit.
