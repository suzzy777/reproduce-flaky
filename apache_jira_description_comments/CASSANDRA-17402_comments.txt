Tests are running...

[~jlewandowski] do you have CI results for this?

[~adelapena] yes, sorry for not pasting

[~adelapena] I think the tests looks ok - the failed jvm-dtests are flaky (I've checked locally, they work), the dtest failure is due to the fact that fix from CASSANDRA-16349 is not in my branch yet - can this be merged ?

[~jlewandowski] it looks good, could you please prepare a PR for trunk? There could be some divergence there due to CASSANDRA-16896.

Thanks [~adelapena], I've applied your comment and created trunk PR, also started CI.

The PR for trunk looks good to me. It seems that the CI runs are hitting the problems with testing introduced by CASSANDRA-15234. Here are CI runs pointed to the patched version of CCM that fixes those problems:

The CI runs above also include some repeated runs of {{{}ObjectSizesTest{}}}.

CI results look good to me, all failures [are known|https://butler.cassandra.apache.org/#/], +1.

I think we are ready to commit, unless [~blambov] has anything else to add.

The patch looks good to me.

Great, thanks. Committed to 4.0 asÂ [a690f339ab0f2b98c69621ca5a0bad10ae9a7919|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/a690f339ab0f2b98c69621ca5a0bad10ae9a7919] and merged to [trunk|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/0d8126dd143898588f4efcdc40b8e2bb10597185].

Thank you [~adelapena] !
