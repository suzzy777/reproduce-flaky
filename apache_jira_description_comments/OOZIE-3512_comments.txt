Unfortunately I was unable to reproduce it locally.

[~asalamon74],I have try to reproduce it locally.I think this problem caused by the container resource for example memory/core number.Because In XTestCase
{code:java}
// code placeholder
private static final int DEFAULT_YARN_TIMEOUT = 60_000;{code}
When I set this TIMEOUT = 1000, It can reproduce. But In 60_000, It is  no  problem. So I think the program is good.

So In some machine It shows failed , Just because the application in ACCEPTED State When the time out. If we give it more time, Maybe the application can run success. 

[~nobigo] Thanks for checking this, I'm not sure if more time alone would fix the problem. Even if it's slower I think the the status should be {{<RUNNING>}} and not {{<ACCEPTED>}}. Why do you think it's still accepted after a minute? I don't really know what is special in this test method.

[~asalamon74], I think the resource not enough really can cause the application ACCEPTED. Because I have try  to reproduce But it never show .This issue may be isn't need to repair . Otherwise we need more detailed steps to reproduce it.

I also had problem reproducing the issue, the test was working for me correctly. But I've seen PreCommit builds with this, so it's definitely a flaky. Maybe we should wait till someone will be able to reproduce it, and get back to it later.

[~asalamon74], Thank you very much. I will continue working on this until someone able to reproduce it.

Usually an application stays in ACCEPTED state if there are not enough resources (vcores / memory). Another problem is when a node manager becomes UNHEALTHY - we set up the Mini YARN cluster with a single NM cluster, so if that happens, we can't run any applications. This happened many times before due to disk space issues and the disk checker, having detected a low amount of free space, marked the NM as "unhealthy" so we ended up with 0 NMs. But this was addressed and the threshold was raised to 99% or 100%. Anyway I'd examine the RM or NM output from the Mini cluster to see why this wasn't scheduled.
