It is because we didn't await for {{Slave::_statusUpdateAcknowledgement}} which would complete task.

    Fixed the flaky test case `AgentAPITest.GetState`.
    
    This test case is flaky because we didn't wait for the agent receives
    and properly handles the ACK of `TASK_KILLED`. Then the agent may have
    not yet marked the task completed when we perform the query.
