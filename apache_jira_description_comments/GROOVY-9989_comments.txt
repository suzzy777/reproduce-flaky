it seems that it is Groovy which is providing jcenter by default https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/96e5cd2deef25d07b1ec9dc66467b0046612038e/src/resources/groovy/grape/defaultGrapeConfig.xml#L31

based on https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/ FAQ  {quote}After this date JCenter repository will still resolve artifacts, but end users should migrate to the canonical repo (e.g. Java packages should be retrieved from Maven Central){quote}

they recommend to move to a maven resolver

https://github.com/apache/ant-ivy/blame/master/asciidoc/tutorial/start.adoc#L50

{quote}Ivy uses the Maven 2 central repository by default{quote}

so maybe no need to replace but to remove the bintray resolver?
I hav not foudn aspecific Maven resolver in https://github.com/apache/ant-ivy/blob/master/asciidoc/settings/resolvers.adoc#built-in-resolvers

Maven 2 repository is coming through default ibiblio resolver https://github.com/apache/ant-ivy/blob/79bd0ce1f44d17126783c5b02f748a474925c4a2/src/java/org/apache/ivy/core/settings/repository.properties#L19

provided PRs for Ivy related impact: https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1525 https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1524 https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1523.

it remains other impacts:
* download of Groovy is pointing to bintray:
** https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/master/README.adoc#downloading
** https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/master/src/spec/doc/core-getting-started.adoc#stable
** so I guess there is a mechanism to update somewhere to stop trying to upload to bintray?
* badges on readme https://github.com/apache/groovy/blame/master/README.adoc#L34-L37
* a gradle config https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/96e5cd2deef25d07b1ec9dc66467b0046612038e/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/org.apache.groovy-common.gradle#L53

Overlaps with GROOVY-9958

Also note workaround is to not rely on {{defaultGrapeConfig}} but instead have your own {{grapeConfig.xml}} file in a {{.groovy/grape}} directory.

I changed the scope of this to be just the grape/IVY config file and made it a child of GROOVY-9958.

Uploading is done via Gradle scripts here:

Groovy 4 is in good shape, it goes via ASF sonatype instance and currently places a copy in bintray (we'll disable/remove the copy step).

Groovy 2/3 gets to Maven Central via Bintray. It has to go direct to Sonatype and we haven't finished tweaking the process yet.

Fix for Groovy 4 (master): is to remove JCenter.

Fix for Groovy 2/3 is to move JCenter to the last in the list of resolvers. This should allow things to still work for folks who haven't finished porting away from Bintray/JCenter with minimal impact on users who have. We should remove the JCenter entry in a later version of Groovy.
