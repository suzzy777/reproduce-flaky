    IMPALA-4904,IMPALA-4914: add targeted-stress to exhaustive tests

    This patch allows any test suites whose workload is "targeted-stress" to
    be run in so-called "exhaustive" mode. Before this patch, only suites
    whose workload was "functional-query" would be run exhaustively. More on
    this flaw is in IMPALA-3947.

    The net effects are:

    1. We fix IMPALA-4904, which allows test_ddl_stress to start running
       again.
    2. We also improve the situation in IMPALA-4914 by getting
       TestSpillStress to run, though we don't fix its
       not-running-concurrently problem.

    The other mini-cluster stress tests were disabled in this commit:
      IMPALA-2605: Omit the sort and mini stress tests
    so they are not directly affected here.

    I also tried to clarify what "exhaustive" means in some of our shell
    scripts, via help text and comments.

    An exhaustive build+test run showed test_ddl_stress and TestSpillStress
    now get run and passed. This adds roughly 12 minutes to a build that's
    on the order of 13-14 hours.

fixes problems 1 and 2. I am reducing the priority and changing the summary to deal with 3.


IMPALA-4914,IMPALA-4999: remove flaky TestSpillStress

The test does not work as intended and would likely not provide
very good coverage of the different spilling paths, because it
only runs a single simple query. The stress test
(tests/stress/concurrent_select.py) provides much better coverage.
test_mem_usage_scaling.py probably also provides better coverage
that TestSpillStress in its current form.
