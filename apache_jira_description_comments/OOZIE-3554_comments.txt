Similarly to LUCENE-8986, I've created a .asf.yaml file. [~asalamon74] / [~dionusos] could you please review the created .asf.yaml file? Thank you.

PreCommit-OOZIE-Build started


[~jmakai] I followed the link in the file to the documentation: [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/git+-+.asf.yaml+features] and it states the following:
{quote}Do not use the document separator – in your .asf.yaml file. It will cause parsing to fail.
{quote}
I'm not sure if this document separator is the same as the {{---}} used in the file, but probably it would be safer not to use it. (Lucene has no such separator).

BTW, is there a way to test this asf.yaml file? Maybe in a forked repo?
