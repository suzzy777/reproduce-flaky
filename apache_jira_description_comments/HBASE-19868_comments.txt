[~psomogyi] How'd you extract the exception? Going about nightlies, I was unable to get good log. The exception seems to come after the log run at 

02:36:36,686 (Log here ends at [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-2/203/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.access/TestCoprocessorWhitelistMasterObserver/org_apache_hadoop_hbase_security_access_TestCoprocessorWhitelistMasterObserver/]  2018-01-26 02:36:36,440)

I can't make the test fail locally which I'm guessing is what you are finding.

(I was looking to see why we are not archiving the surefire test run output seemingly. It looks like the flags are in place but i can't find the raw emissions. Need to dig more).

So, the odd thing about this test is conf.setInt("hbase.client.retries.number", 1) (I think). If stuff is slow around startup, we'll fail our one attempt. Its happening in

ClusterSchemaServiceImpl which is cast as a Guava Service. It is being started async. Are we stuck in 

isTableAvailableAndInitialized failing our one attempt over and over. I can't tell. Or is it that Master fails to come up and then we are just stuck in mini cluster startup trying to scan a meta that is not coming? Let me try some debug and up the retries to 5.... Test should still fail fast....

 

2.001 just ups retries from 1 to 5. Test runs in about same time locally at least. Pushed to master and branch-2 to see.

Oh, flakey 2.0 just came in. It has a few of these failures in the top-list. Thats good because these have more logs.... [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBASE-Flaky-Tests-branch2.0/983/] I'm still a bit stuck though. Our thread-dumper seems to be missing in this test run.... 

 

 

[~stack], I was not able to get the logs through Test Results, but I found these log entries when I downloaded the [test_logs.zip|https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-2/203/artifact/output-jdk8-hadoop2/test_logs.zip] from the Artifacts.

There you can find something like this which indicates the test case was started:

018-01-26 02:36:20,256 INFO  [Time-limited test] hbase.ResourceChecker(148): before: security.access.TestCoprocessorWhitelistMasterObserver#testCreationNonWhitelistedCoprocessorPath Thread=258, OpenFileDescriptor=2184, MaxFileDescriptor=1048576, SystemLoadAverage=1594, ProcessCount=15, AvailableMemoryMB=11745

I can't find anything in the logs that it ever finished. For other tests you can see something like this:

2018-01-26 02:36:20,239 INFO  [Time-limited test] hbase.ResourceChecker(172): after: security.access.TestCoprocessorWhitelistMasterObserver#testDFSNameWhitelistedWorks Thread=258 (was 232) - Thread LEAK? -, OpenFileDescriptor=2184 (was 1889) - OpenFileDescriptor LEAK? -, MaxFileDescriptor=1048576 (was 1048576), SystemLoadAverage=1594 (was 1584) - SystemLoadAverage LEAK? -, ProcessCount=16 (was 15) - ProcessCount LEAK? -, AvailableMemoryMB=11747 (was 12147)

I was also unable to reproduce it locally. I will try to work on this today.

Looking into the latest log files the fix you pushed made the TestCoprocessorWhitelistMasterObserver#testCreationNonWhitelistedCoprocessorPath to pass. Even so TestCoprocessorWhitelistMasterObserver still failed with another test: testSubstringNonWhitelisted.

I think this failure is related to the newly introduced timeout. The test is categorized as Medium test, so the timeout is 180 seconds.
 First log entry for this test is at 2018-01-29 20:35:14,223 and the "Shutting down HBase Cluster" message was at 2018-01-29 20:38:14,211.

I can upload a patch to recategorize TestCoprocessorWhitelistMasterObserver as Large test. 

CC: [~Apache9]

Thanks [~psomogyi] for the ping. I'm +1 on changing all tests which run longer than 2 minutes to LargeTests as 3 minutes is a hard limit, we need to make sure that the test will not timeout even if runs on a slow machine(like our jenkins...).

Thanks.

Lets try it [~psomogyi] I pushed to master and branch-2. There is likely an issue in here around the creation of the namespace artifacts done in the async Service but hopefully it manifests again in a manner in which we can see better what is going on.

 

Leaving this open until we can say for sure the test is fixed. Thanks.
