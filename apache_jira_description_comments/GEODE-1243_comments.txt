GEODE-1243: Missed fixing one test for parameterization

GEODE-1243: Missed fixing one test for parameterization


Regarding docs, BruceS had the following comment as part of the review:

I think you need to document this for users so that no-one comes across it and, for whatever reason, uses it in a non-test environment.  Just include in the documentation that it can't be used with auto-reconnect.  The locator may reconnect but it will have a different port.

The purpose of this bit of functionality is to ease writing tests. It is not intended to be used under 'normal' conditions.

GEODE-4176 locator creates "locator0view.dat" file when started with port 0

Modified the locator to ensure that the wildcard bind has occurred before
GMSLocator creates its persistent view file.  I also did some code
cleanup and addressed GEODE-1243.

This closes #1214
