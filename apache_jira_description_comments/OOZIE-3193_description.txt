We're using tags to kill applications. Subworkflows have special tags like {{workflowID@subwfAcitonID@actionID}} 
Right now we're not getting the subWorkflow config properly in JavaAE.kill() so we're looking for the tag {{subWorkflowID@actionID}} to kill. Therefore actions submitted via subworkflows are not killed properly.
