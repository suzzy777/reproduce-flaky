showed up in nightly for all branches that got HBASE-20940 right after it landed, which added these calls to TEST_UTIL.

we shouldn't have TestTableResource reaching into a test class in a different module like this.

-v0
  - avoid calling split at all by requesting the number of regions we want at creation
  - fix a bug in how the test turns non-printable characters into a string

note that due to HBASE-19265, precommit isn't going to run TestTableResource (it's in the untrusted list because it fails 100% of the time before this patch). reviewers should manually run the test locally to confirm it works. Doing this while doing a minimum of other things: {{mvn -Dtest=TestTableResource -pl hbase-rest -am package}}

both of those checkstyle warnings are easy fixes. Can do on commit or will post a new patch if anyone wants some other change.

Tried locally, it works for me. +1 after you fixing the checkstyle issues. Let's push it to master to see if the flaky dashboard also says OK.

Thanks.

sweet. will push to master shortly and then can backport once the flaky job has a go at running it a few times.

v1 what I pushed to master
  - fixes checkstyle problems precommit found
  - fixes comment that said "three" instead of "four" regions were requested.

done as v0 + addendum because in my "update, test, push" cycle I forgot to commit the staged changes before pushing :(

[~Apache9] last 4 runs came back green:

https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/master/8/artifact/dashboard.html#job_2

let me know when there are enough green runs for you to be comfortable with me backporting.

Patch for master looks good me.

Thanks for working on this, Sean.

Looks ready to go?
Let's commit. Just ran into this on the branch-2s, still an issue there, though not on master, at least for me.

I was waiting for Duo's view since it's been on master. has passed the last 25 runs. will push when i get back to a computer.

+1. The flaky dashboard is good. All green after we commit the patch to master.

pushed to all branches, since even on those that didn't already have the cross-test dependency this removed a busy wait from the test.
