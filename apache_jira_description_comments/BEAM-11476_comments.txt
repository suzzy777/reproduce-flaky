Just saw this here: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Commit/17094/testReport/junit/apache_beam.runners.interactive.interactive_environment_test/InteractiveEnvironmentTest/test_track_user_pipeline_cleanup_non_inspectable_pipeline/

Passing to [~ningk] since it looks like he wrote this test 

Thanks Brian, the flaky (failed) test is here: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Commit/17094/testReport/junit/apache_beam.runners.interactive.interactive_environment_test/InteractiveEnvironmentTest/test_track_user_pipeline_cleanup_non_inspectable_pipeline_2/

The `Standard Errors` are warning logs. I'll see if I can disable the log handler in tests.

Sorry it looks like that link randomly picks one of the executions of the test, and sometimes picks a passing run. The actual failing run is: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Commit/17094/testReport/junit/apache_beam.runners.interactive.interactive_environment_test/InteractiveEnvironmentTest/test_track_user_pipeline_cleanup_non_inspectable_pipeline_5/

(It looks like you found this already though)

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13881 is merged. Could we close this?

We're not 100% sure that pr/13881 will fix the issue, so I wanted to keep this open. I set a reminder for myself to check on this in a week and close if there _aren't_ any more flakes.

[~ningk] it looks like this is still flaking. Here's a failure from yesterday: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Commit/17254/testReport/junit/apache_beam.runners.interactive.interactive_environment_test/InteractiveEnvironmentTest/test_track_user_pipeline_cleanup_non_inspectable_pipeline/

Haven't seen any flakes in this test since #13984 went in, closing this. Thanks Ning!
