Caused by CASSANDRA-10392

There's a small bug in https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/tracing/Tracing.java#L153

{noformat}
    public UUID newSession(UUID sessionId, Map<String,ByteBuffer> customPayload)
    {
        return newSession(sessionId, TraceType.QUERY, Collections.EMPTY_MAP);
    }{noformat}

in that it passes on an {{EMPTY_MAP}} instead of the {{customPayload}}.

I've marked this as "minor" as custom tracing plugins can easily enough workaround it by also overriding the {{newSession(UUID sessionId, Map<String,ByteBuffer> customPayload)}} method.
