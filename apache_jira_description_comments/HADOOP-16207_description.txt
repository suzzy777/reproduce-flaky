Reported failure of {{ITestDirectoryCommitMRJob}} in validation runs of HADOOP-16186; assertIsDirectory with s3guard enabled and a parallel test run: Path "is recorded as deleted by S3Guard"

{code}
    waitForConsistency();
    assertIsDirectory(outputPath) /* here */
{code}

The file is there but there's a tombstone. Possibilities

* some race condition with another test
* tombstones aren't timing out
* committers aren't creating that base dir in a way which cleans up S3Guard's tombstones. 

Remember: we do have to delete that dest dir before the committer runs unless overwrite==true, so at the start of the run there will be a tombstone. It should be overwritten by a success.
