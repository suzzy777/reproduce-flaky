Steps to reproduce:
 1. Add `::sleep(1)` before [sending http response|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/95bbe784da51b3a7eaeb9127e2541ea0b2af07b5/3rdparty/libprocess/src/http.cpp#L1741] to a socket.
 2. Recompile and run: `make check GTEST_FILTER=ContentType/AgentAPIStreamingTest.AttachInputToNestedContainerSession/0`

    Fixed disconnection for ATTACH_CONTAINER_INPUT call in IOSwitchboard.
    
    Previously, an http response for the `ATTACH_CONTAINER_INPUT` call
    could be lost due to immediate termination of the IOSwitchboard
    process after the termination of the IOSwitchboard actor. Since the
    IOSwitchboard process didn't wait for completion of sending all
    responses back to the agent, the agent received disconnection error.
    To fix the issue, this patch adds explicit finalization of libprocess
    before returning from the IOSwitchboard's main function.

    Ensured correct termination order in IOSwitchboard's main function.
    
    This patch terminates `IOSwitchboardServer` actor before calling
    `process::finalize()`. This patch is an addition to commit 02ebf9986a.

I've reverted the {{finalize()}} patch for now. We should commit it after MESOS-8729 is fixed.

    Revert "Fixed disconnection for ATTACH_CONTAINER_INPUT call...".
    
    This reverts commit 02ebf9986ab5ce883a71df72e9e3392a3e37e40e.
    
    Though this patch does fix the intended issue, it apparently surfaces
    a bug in libprocess, which leads to a deadlock during IOSwitchBoard
    finalization. Until the libprocess bug is fixed, it is better to
    drop a single message and have one flaky tests than have a process
    stuck during the cleanup and have multiple flaky tests and likely
    issues in production.
{noformat}

Once this is fixed, {{ROOT_CGROUPS_LaunchNestedContainerSessionsInParallel}} should be enabled.

When the agent handles {{ATTACH_CONTAINER_INPUT}} call, it creates an HTTP [streaming connection|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/12636838f78ad06b66466b3d2fa9c9db94ac70b2/src/slave/http.cpp#L3104] to IOSwitchboard.
 After the agent [sends|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/12636838f78ad06b66466b3d2fa9c9db94ac70b2/src/slave/http.cpp#L3141] a request to IOSwitchboard, a new instance of {{ConnectionProcess}} is created, which calls [{{ConnectionProcess::read()}}|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/12636838f78ad06b66466b3d2fa9c9db94ac70b2/3rdparty/libprocess/src/http.cpp#L1220] to read an HTTP response from IOSwitchboard.
 If the socket is closed before a `\r\n\r\n` response is received, the {{ConnectionProcess}} calls `[disconnect()|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/12636838f78ad06b66466b3d2fa9c9db94ac70b2/3rdparty/libprocess/src/http.cpp#L1326]`, which in turn [flushes `pipeline`|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/12636838f78ad06b66466b3d2fa9c9db94ac70b2/3rdparty/libprocess/src/http.cpp#L1197-L1201] containing a {{Response}} promise. This leads to responding back (to the {{AttachInputToNestedContainerSession}} [test|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/12636838f78ad06b66466b3d2fa9c9db94ac70b2/src/tests/api_tests.cpp#L7942-L7943]) an {{HTTP 500}} error with body "Disconnected".

When io redirect finishes, IOSwitchboardServerProcess calls {{terminate(self(), false)}} (here [\[1\]|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/12636838f78ad06b66466b3d2fa9c9db94ac70b2/src/slave/containerizer/mesos/io/switchboard.cpp#L1262] or there [\[2\]|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/12636838f78ad06b66466b3d2fa9c9db94ac70b2/src/slave/containerizer/mesos/io/switchboard.cpp#L1713]). Then, {{IOSwitchboardServerProcess::finalize()}} sets a value to the [`promise`|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/12636838f78ad06b66466b3d2fa9c9db94ac70b2/src/slave/containerizer/mesos/io/switchboard.cpp#L1304-L1308], which [unblocks {{main()}}|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/12636838f78ad06b66466b3d2fa9c9db94ac70b2/src/slave/containerizer/mesos/io/switchboard_main.cpp#L149-L150] function. As a result, IOSwitchboard process terminates immediately.

When IOSwitchboard terminates, there could be not yet [written|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/12636838f78ad06b66466b3d2fa9c9db94ac70b2/3rdparty/libprocess/src/http.cpp#L1699] response messages to the socket. So, if any delay occurs before [sending|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/95bbe784da51b3a7eaeb9127e2541ea0b2af07b5/3rdparty/libprocess/src/http.cpp#L1742-L1748] the response back to the agent, the socket will be closed due to IOSwitchboard process termination. That leads to the aforementioned premature socket close in the agent.

    Fixed HTTP errors caused by dropped HTTP responses by IOSwitchboard.
    
    Previously, IOSwitchboard process could terminate before all HTTP
    responses had been sent to the agent. In the case of
    `ATTACH_CONTAINER_INPUT` call, we could drop a final HTTP `200 OK`
    response, so the agent got broken HTTP connection for the call.
    This patch introduces an acknowledgment for the received response
    for the `ATTACH_CONTAINER_INPUT` call. This acknowledgment is a new
    type of control messages for the `ATTACH_CONTAINER_INPUT` call. When
    IOSwitchboard receives an acknowledgment, and io redirects are
    finished, it terminates itself. That guarantees that the agent always
    receives a response for the `ATTACH_CONTAINER_INPUT` call.

    Fixed disconnection while sending acknowledgment to IOSwitchboard.
    
    Previously, an HTTP connection to the IOSwitchboard could be garbage
    collected before the agent sent an acknowledgment to the IOSwitchboard
    via this connection. This patch fixes the issue by keeping a reference
    count to the connection in a lambda callback until disconnection
    occurs.

    Fixed broken pipe error in IOSwitchboard.
    
    Previous attempt to fix `HTTP 500` "broken pipe" in review /r/62187/
    was not correct: after IOSwitchboard sends a response to the agent for
    the `ATTACH_CONTAINER_INPUT` call, the socket is closed immediately,
    thus causing the error on the agent. This patch adds a delay after
    IO redirects are finished and before IOSwitchboard forcibly send a
    response.
