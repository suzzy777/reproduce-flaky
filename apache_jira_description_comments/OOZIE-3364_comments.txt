Currently, there is no FIFO guarantee for Coord Action execution on refresh command.
In this patch OOZIE-3364-1.patch, on rerun/refresh command, we are retrieving the coord actions in given execution order (FIFO/LIFO). 
Even after this, the order in which coord actions start running is determined by the input check. 
If all the dependencies for all actions are available, then highly likely that they will start running in given order.

Thanks for the contribution [~satishsaley]!

Some questions / comments / asks on the patch 2:
* what about considering also [{{CoordinatorAction#SKIPPED}}|https://oozie.apache.org/docs/5.0.0/CoordinatorFunctionalSpec.html#a6.1.3.2._Coordinator_Action_Status] as terminal states in {{CoordinatorActionBean#GET_TERMINATED_ACTIONS_FOR_DATES_FIFO}} and {{CoordinatorActionBean#GET_TERMINATED_ACTIONS_FOR_DATES_LIFO}}?
* what about considering the other two execution modes {{LAST_ONLY}} and {{NONE}} as well?
* unclear why {{CoordActionsInDateRange#getActionsFromDateRange()}} doesn't consider execution mode {{NONE}} similarly as {{LAST_ONLY}} and {{LIFO}}
* missing new test cases around all the execution modes and possible mixture of {{CoordinatorActionBean}} instances of different execution modes plus different {{start}}, {{end}}, and {{nominal}} timestamps
* missing test cases covering new JPA queries {{CoordinatorActionBean#GET_TERMINATED_ACTIONS_FOR_DATES_FIFO}} and {{GET_TERMINATED_ACTIONS_FOR_DATES_LIFO}}
