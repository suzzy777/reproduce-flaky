   > @vdiravka, looks like you've nailed it! Can I convert this PR out of draft and review it?
   
   Yes, I think it is ready. I didn't find optimal memory configs fo Travis build. Since there is [7.5Gb](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/#virtualisation-environment-vs-operating-system) ENV memory limit. So there are 3 ways:
   1. long term: optimize Drill memory usage, like it was earlier
   2. to use paid plan for Travis.com builds
   3. to disable 2 forks for Maven build for Travis, because it uses more memory, than one fork. So it will be longer, but it will be less loaded on memory.
   
   I've chosen third for now and found the build still faster than GitHub CI builds. So the solution looks fine to me.
