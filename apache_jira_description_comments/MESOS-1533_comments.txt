HealthCheckTest.ConsecutiveFailures is also flaky: https://builds.apache.org/job/Mesos-Trunk-Ubuntu-Build-Out-Of-Src-Set-JAVA_HOME/2198/consoleText

All the health check tests seem flaky. I'm going to disable them for now to unbreak the build.

    Temporarily disabled health check tests due to MESOS-1533.


This log line from the executor's log seems to be problematic:

{noformat}
W0623 23:24:24.733916 38883 main.cpp:326] Health check failed HTTP health check is not supported
{noformat}


I just tried it on a linux machine and got a error trying to launch health-check from build/src/.libs folder and complaining not able to find the shared library. Another rebuild however made it went away.

Overall I think I'm using EXPECT_* instead of ASSERT_* in my tests so none of them halt on assertion, which the tests seems to run forever for some reason even though the task itself should finish already.

Also it's odd that HTTP health check error msg shows up, I didn't see it anywhere in the CI log?
It should have been blank in all my tests.

[~tnachen] I got this from the executor's log (stderr in the sandbox). CI log does not show that. I am also surprised since I didn't see any of the code set this field:(

    Re-enabled health check tests
    
    Currently the health check tests are disabled as it was flaky. Part of the reason is that all assertions was EXPECTs instead of ASSERTs so it will continue to execute.
    Another issue was it's currently discovering the path to launch health check executable from the command executor main argv[0] path.
    However, the correct path is to launch the generated script that does library path resolution, which is the parent of .libs.
