RemoteKsckTest.TestClusterWithLocation is flaky

Alexey took a look at it and here is the analysis:

In essence, due to slowness of TSAN builds, connection negotiation from kudu CLI to one of master servers timed out, so one of the preconditions of the test didn't meet.  The error output by the test was:
{code:java}
/data/somelongdirectorytoavoidrpathissues/src/kudu/src/kudu/tools/ksck_remote-test.cc:523: Failure
Failed                                                                          
Bad status: Network error: failed to gather info from all masters: 1 of 3 had errors
{code}
The corresponding error in the master's log was:
{code:java}

{code}
We are seeing this on the flaky test dashboard for both TSAN and ASAN builds.
