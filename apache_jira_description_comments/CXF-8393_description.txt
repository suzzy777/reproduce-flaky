There are a number of tests which are flaky and fail the builds from time to time. We should address those by fixing or at last, removing them altogether.

Adding test retry to the offending modules ([https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/rerun-failing-tests.html]) should help.

While the retrying does not fix the flaky tests, it should help reduce the number of builds that fail. The end goal is to fix the flaky tests.
