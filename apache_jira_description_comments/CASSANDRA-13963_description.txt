The unit test [SecondaryIndexManagerTest.indexWithfailedInitializationIsNotQueryableAfterPartialRebuild|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/index/SecondaryIndexManagerTest.java#L460-L476] is flaky. Apart from [the CI results showing a 3% flakiness|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/All_Jobs/job/trunk_utest/2430/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.index/SecondaryIndexManagerTest/indexWithfailedInitializationIsNotQueryableAfterPartialRebuild/], the test failure can be locally reproduced just running the test multiple times. In my case, it fails 2-5 times for each 1000 executions.
