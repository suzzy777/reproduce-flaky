002 patch: Add missing license header.

Can someone review this patch? I observed about 2% of the jobs failed after the log4j hotpatch applied.

Hey [~aajisaka] 

Thanks for the patch.

One minor comment: unfortunately Oozie Yarn applications use stdout and stderr instead of a logger to print. Could you please follow this pattern in your change?

Otherwise looks good to me.

 

Thanks,

Denes

Thank you [~dionusos] for your comment. Updated.

003 patch: Use stderr for error messages instead of logger.

[~aajisaka] sorry for the another change request:
{code:java}
} catch (NoSuchFileException e) {
    System.err.println("A file or directory may be deleted when printing the current directory. Retrying.");
    e.printStackTrace();
} {code}
As this exception is handled as an ignored thing I think printing out the stack trace could scare the users that something bad happened. But nothing, Oozie just handled an expected issue correctly.

Do you allow me to remove the {{e.printStackTrace();}} from the final change? If yes then I'll do it then commit your change.

 

Thanks

Sure. It can be removed. Thanks!

004 patch: Removed {{e.printStackTrace();}}
