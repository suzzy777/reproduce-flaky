Kishan reported a similar issue. The test in 11804 is flaky, while I can always successfully reproduce this issue.
And Kishan said 'I was able to repro on C* 3.5 but not in C* 3.6', but I find this bug in 3.11.6. 
So maybe it's a new issue? 

I cannot reproduce it with CCM on latest cassandra 3.11:
 * ccm create -n 3 apollo --install-dir=TO_CASSANDRA && ccm start
 * cqlsh> create keyspace ks WITH replication = \{'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 3};
cqlsh> use ks;
cqlsh:ks> create table cf (key int primary key, value int);
cqlsh:ks> insert into cf (key, value) values(1,1);
 * ccm node2 stop && ccm node3 stop
 * cqlsh> select * from ks.cf

[~jasonstack] Sorry, I checked my cqlsh history, and found that my replication_factor is 2.
This time I use your commands, except changing replication_factor to 2.
In my cluster, node 1 and node 3 store the data replica.
After stopping node 2 and node 3, I get NoHostAvailable when select * from ks.cf on node 1.

Hi [~ycozy]Â  are you still seeing this issue? are you using authentication?
