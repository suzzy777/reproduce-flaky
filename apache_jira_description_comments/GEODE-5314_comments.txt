GEODE-5314: Cleanup and document MBeanStatsMonitor child classes

- Fixed minor warnings.
- Added JUnit Tests for all modified classes.
- There's only one thread updating the mutable values so it's been
  decided to keep volatiles instead of moving to atomics.
- Documentation improved to better explain the thread-safety of the
  classes.
