[~yifanc], do you have a link to example failure? I also guess it fails 4.0+ as I noticed jdk11? 

Yes. Adding the CircleCI link, [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/yifan-c/cassandra/423/workflows/52bd3d13-b88a-428c-aaf7-18744c05a166/jobs/4323/tests]

Thanks, I actually at first got lost what I am seeing as there was this on top of the description error:
{code:java}
Unable to find source-code formatter for language: plain. Available languages are: actionscript, ada, applescript, bash, c, c#, c++, cpp, css, erlang, go, groovy, haskell, html, java, javascript, js, json, lua, none, nyan, objc, perl, php, python, r, rainbow, ruby, scala, sh, sql, swift, visualbasic, xml, yaml{code}
It seems that was related to usage of _code:plain_ in Jira, I switched it to \{code}

Yeah.. That prompt is not related to the issue. It is gone after switching to {code : none}
