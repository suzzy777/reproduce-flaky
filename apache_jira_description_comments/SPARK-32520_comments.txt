cc [~kabhwan] and [~gsomogyi] FYI. Would you guys mind taking a look when you guys find some time?

Commented on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32519. If it's comes often and Jungtaek can't take a look then I suggest a rollback and I can pick it up 3 weeks later (vacation).

I'll take a look today. Let's revert once I fail to make it in couple of days.

This was fixed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29343 together.
