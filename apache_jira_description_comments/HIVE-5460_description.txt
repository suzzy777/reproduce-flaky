ISO-SQL 2011 defines how lag and lead should behave when invalid offsets are provided to the functions.

i.e. select tint.rnum,tint.cint, lag( tint.cint, -100 )  over ( order by tint.rnum) from tint tint 

Instead of a meaningful error (as other vendors will emit) you get 

Error: Query returned non-zero code: 2, cause: FAILED: Execution Error, return code 2 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.MapRedTask
SQLState:  08S01
ErrorCode: 2
