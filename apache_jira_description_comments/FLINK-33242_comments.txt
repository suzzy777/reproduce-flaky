The tests are not consistently failing:

Interestingly, we have a build where the yarn tests didn't fail: https://github.com/XComp/flink/actions/runs/6707387404/job/18226397885

The issue didn't reappear for a while. I'm closing it as not-reproducible to track that there's no effort put into investigating it further for now. We can re-open this Jira again if the problem re-occurs.
