Being resolved, I will PR soon. Probably need guidance on underlying configuration.

    fix python interpreter as to use max result setting

    ### What is this PR for?
    zeppelin_python.py used a hard-coded 1000 rows limit when returning results. This PR makes sure that the interpreter retrieves the max_results from PythonInterpreter.java and that the latter retrieves this configuration from the configuration via the properties object.

    + make a dataframe with more than a 1000 rows
    + z.show the dataframe
    + export it in csv

    Is the Jenkins failure an unrelated selenium test failure, or do I have to look into it?

    ping @zjffdu Do I have to look into it the Selenium test failure?

    @paularmand Selenium test is flaky, one thing left is unit test. Could you add unit test in `PythonInterpreterTest` ï¼Ÿ

    Pong @jongyoul . I wrote the unit test, but it is not passing on Jenkins. I have trouble setting up my local IDE to run the python tests in IntelliJ (all other tests, except the python ones, are running fine), so I'll have to dig deeper in the IDE settings. Pointers/help appreciated.

    Let me check


[~zjffdu] not having this issue in 0.7.2 anymore, so you can close this one. I guess.

Thanks [~paularmand] for verifying it. Close it. 

It is fixed somewhere else. 

Sorry, @zjffdu, I jumped the gun (was on a workaround).
Not fixed yet, please keep open.

I am still facing the same issue for Zeppelin 0.8.

This should be fixed in 0.9. I make some code refactoring in 0.9

Can It be possible with 0.8 upcoming release?
