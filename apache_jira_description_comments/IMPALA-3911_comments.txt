    IMPALA-3772: Fix admission control flaky stress test

+ [~hxu], [~aphadke], [~bharathv]

[~hxu], [~aphadke], [~bharathv], would one of you mind pulling this change onto the release branch that we run tests on?

Ping? Is this still an issue?

Doesn't look like this has been showing up on coverage builds anymore.
