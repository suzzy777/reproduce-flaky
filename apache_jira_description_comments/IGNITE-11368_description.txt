As of now indexes information for JDBC drivers get by another way then system SQL view INDEXES. Need to use single source of the information to have consistent picture.

So, JDBC drivers should use the same source as SQL view INDEXES (org.apache.ignite.internal.processors.query.h2.sys.view.SqlSystemViewIndexes)
Start point for JDBC index metadata is org.apache.ignite.internal.jdbc2.JdbcDatabaseMetadata#getIndexInfo

Also order of result should be correspond Javadoc ('ordered by NON_UNIQUE, TYPE, INDEX_NAME, and ORDINAL_POSITION') - at present it is not so.
