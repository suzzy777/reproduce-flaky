[~matijhs], did you manage to test this out in your deployment? 

[~gezapeti] I've tested this together with [~matijhs]. The attached version does not work correctly, according to our tests the type of the truststore should also be specified.

Thanks [~asalamon74] for the summary. However it turned out, that the issue might be somewhere else... there is this function  
SSLServerConnectorFactory#setKeystorePass where we call sslContextFactory.KeyManagerPassword(keystorePass) instead of setKeyStorePassword. 

The patch is working if we change this part, which I could not understand well, so I would like to test it out better in a deployment.


Uploading a new patch, tested in a deployment. Please see the diff in SSLServerConnectorFactory#setKeystorePass.

Some explanation on the relation of KeyManagerPassword and KeyStorePassword from the eclipse docs: https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.3.27.v20190418/configuring-ssl.html#configuring-sslcontextfactory

I would say that using a PKCS12 keystore requires the sslContextFactory.KeyStorePassword to be set instead (or besides) of KeyManagerPassword. If jetty's KeyManagerPassword is not set the KeyStorePassword will be used for that as well.
