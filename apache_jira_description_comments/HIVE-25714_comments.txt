apparently; the docker log command times out after 5 seconds 
https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/dbec7744f04a9389e1bb168e85b5e8f73d357011/itests/util/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/externalDB/AbstractExternalDB.java#L123

launched flaky-check for it ; I doubt that it will give more info - but it will have the full hive.log and seeing how long earlier `docker log` cmds took might help
http://ci.hive.apache.org/job/hive-flaky-check/466/

the testrun also contains some info - it seems like the docker log command for oracle took over a second every time it was executed; maybe it has a lot of logs?
fyi: [~zabetak]

The good news is that the flaky checker is still running which means that the problem may not be that often :D Maybe we can just increase the timeout till a better solution is found.

ok; I'm not a big fan of that - but of course we can try that...actually; adding some log lines could also help to know how much stuff we are reading from docker logs

Actually there is a busy-wait loop when launching the containers which waits for one sec ({{Thread.sleep(1000);}}) before asking again for logs.

I agree that including some log lines could help us understand better what the problem is. We could actually do it only when the container fails to start. I will do the modif and launch again the flaky checker.

I just seen that you already launched a few jobs with additional logging so I will not launch a new job to save some resources. What I had in mind to do debug the prob was this: https://github.com/zabetak/hive/commit/e77bc002c5f5d553e4c24fbc5cf742899aa1ed98

apparently the logs are empty when the issue happens - so that idea is off the table

it seems like things were going okay - without any logs returned for a while; then it almost timed out with 4s and then  it did time out

I think the oracle image is much larger beast and it takes more time for the docker daemon to launch it - I wonder what storage driver docker is using in these pods....it could be that its using the very basic vfs which does a lot file ops...

merged into master. Thank you Stamatis for reviewing the changes!

forgot to link the green flaky check result; but its here: http://ci.hive.apache.org/job/hive-flaky-check/471/ :D
