[~ash] thank you for raising this issue. Its great you are making an effort to change this. Unfortunately, at this time, the Python client is not *yet* under the purview of this JIRA -- the drivers are not currently owned by the Apache project. I will mention this ticket in our Slack channel where some of the client developers are also present. I would recommend contacting the project directly in the meantime: https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/projects/PYTHON/issues/?filter=allissues&. After that has been completed, it looks like we have some follow-up to do in cqlsh to remove the references. 

Worth noting that while the python api is not in apache cassandra, that doesn't mean there's not room to fix things here:

{code}
jjirsa:cassandra jjirsa$ grep -ir whitelist src/ | wc -l
      19
jjirsa:cassandra jjirsa$ grep -ir blacklist src/ | wc -l
      65
jjirsa:cassandra jjirsa$
{code}


[~jjirsa] you beat me to it. [~ash] would you mind if we repurposed this ticket to the greater Cassandra project instead of the focus on the Python API? 

No, not at all! Feel free.

Just created the python driver ticket about this: https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/PYTHON-1250

  I've updated branches from 2.2 to trunk. The only user-facing change is the {{org.apache.cassandra.db:type=BlacklistedDirectories}} mbean, which I've aliased to {{org.apache.cassandra.db:type=DisallowedDirectories}}. It's unfortunate, but I think we'll need to deprecate that in 4.0 and remove it later.

There's some binary test data (commit logs) which are found if you grep for the black/whitelist, but there's nothing in the actual tests which references their content so I've left them as they are. They're also already removed from trunk.

Thanks [~samt]. I'll start review soon. 

Patch LGTM. The failing unit tests are known to be flaky and are unrelated (along with a clean run on trunk). Lets run the other parts of the suite besides unit tests for good measure but otherwise +1. 

Thanks [~aboudreault] ! (Work, as always, rather got away from me, and I fell down when I needed to sign up for a new account)

Thanks, committed to 2.2 in {{c8c3c269bf1df944b73e2d4bf0008a6f412bf121}} and merged to trunk. I've added a deprecation notice to {{NEWS.txt}} in trunk only.
