    [ZEPPELIN-1219] Add searching feature to Zeppelin docs site

    ### What is this PR for?
    As more and more document pages are added, it's really hard to find specific pages. So I added searching feature to Zeppelin documentation site([jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based site) using [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com/).
    
     - **How it works?**
      
      I created [`search_data.json`](https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin/blob/6e02423f541cc406e4e41031629609a276a9f481/docs/search_data.json) which is used for docs info template. `lunr.js` combines all of the text from all of the docs in `docs/` into `_site/search_data.json`. It looks like below.

    All the info are comes from [Jekyll YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) variables. (i.e. title, group, description.. that's why I rewrote all docs' title and description.)
    Using this data, [search.js](https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin/blob/6e02423f541cc406e4e41031629609a276a9f481/docs/assets/themes/zeppelin/js/search.js) will do this job!
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    Improvement & Feature
    
    ### Todos
    * [x] - Keep consistency for all docs pages' `Title`
    * [x] - Add some overview sentences to all docs pages' `Description` section (this will be used as the result preview)
    * [x] - Add apache license header to all docs page (some pages are missing the license header currently)
    * [x] - Add LICENSE for `lunr.min.js`
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    [ZEPPELIN-1219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1219)
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    1. Build docs site -> please see [docs/README.md#build-documentation](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/docs#build-documentation)
    2. Click `search` icon in navbar and go to `search.html` page
    3. Type anything you want to search in the search bar (i.e. type `python`, `spark`, `dynamic` ... )

    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update? Yes, for `lunr.min.js`
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? no
    * Does this needs documentation? no

    Great improvement @AhyoungRyu ! Posted few suggestions above.

    It seems the CI failure is irrelevant with this PR. Can someone review this one?


Github user bzz commented on the issue:

    @AhyoungRyu it's better to post CI failure to help getting feedback faster AND search existing JIRA issues, to see if that is something know or being addressed elsewhere.
    
    Here is an example of what I mean for this PR:
    
    ------
    
    Single CI profile Spark 1.4\Scala 2.10 is failing here with
    ```
    [INFO] Building Zeppelin: Server 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
    ...
    Running org.apache.zeppelin.rest.ZeppelinSparkClusterTest
    ....
    org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.LazyOpenInterpreter@20ea2ef9
    
    No output has been received in the last 10 minutes, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.
    
    The build has been terminated
    ```
    
    [Searching JIRA for `ZeppelinSparkClusterTest`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dataproc-initialization-actions/issues/56) brings [ZEPPELIN-862](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-862) which looks very similar and is not relevant to this changes. This PR has been added to that issue to track this flaky tests 
    
    ------
    Hope this helps! 
    
    In my experience if PR author try to follow such steps - that speeds up the review process by order of magnitude AND helps the project to make CI more stable.
    
    Documentation update + search looks great to me, merging if there is no further discussion.

    Yeah right, I should've done that. It was my bad. Let me re-trigger CI then :)

    No worries! A lot of people do not do this and ask no excuses. So let's just show them what excellence means, by annotating further CI failures in case of any, as you did for the last one here :) 
    
    Different profile fails with the same flaky test, not relevant to the changeset.
    
    Looks great to me, and merging to master if there is no further discussion!
