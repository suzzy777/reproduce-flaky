    Actually, what worries me a bit are the test failures of the 3rd and 4th test profile. I think, they're unrelated (especially the Kafka ones which are kind of instable at the moment in general), but the other ones look strange. Can you let them re-run to see if this is consistent?

    @NicoK , thanks for your reviews! 
    
    I checked the travis failure before and thought it should be existing flaky ones. I will re-trigger the tests later and see the results.

    @NicoK , it already passed travis tests this time.
