There are two more filter fields already implemented (not listed in the description): bundle and sla_status.

During development I've found two bugs related to the bundle field filtering: OOZIE-3309 and OOZIE-3310 .

I've added quite a few new filter fields to /v2/sla and also added the new fields to the SLA tab of the oozie UI.
 * V2SLAServlet required at least of the following fields to be specified: app_name, id, parent_id, bundle, nominal_start, nominal_end. Two of the 8 possible fields (sla_status, event_status) are missing from this list. I've added all of my new fields to this list. Maybe this whole part could be eliminated. What is the reason for not allowing to filter only for sla_status field?

 * Searching for nominal time was possible using nominal_start and nominal_end fields. I've followed this naming conversion, so one can filter for actual start time using actualstart_start, actualstart_end fields. Quite confusing filter field names.

 * The SLA tab of the oozie UI was quite strict. You had to specify exactly one of the following two fields: app_name and job_id. I've removed one of the constraints, now it is possible to filter for both fields. Maybe the other constraint should also be removed.

 * I'd like to refactor the firstCondition handling of SLASummaryGetForFilterJPAExecutor if there are no specific reasons for using the current code structure. (I would skip the firstCondition checking and I'd add " AND " always and I'd remove the first AND later)
