I identified this test failure is also caused by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-21775 



{code:java}
-    if (tableName == null && ClientExceptionsUtil.isMetaClearingException(regionException)) {

+ if (ClientExceptionsUtil.isMetaClearingException(regionException)) {
          // For multi-actions, we don't have a table name, but we want to make sure to clear the
          // cache in case there were location-related exceptions. We don't to clear the cache
          // for every possible exception that comes through, however.
          connection.clearCaches(server);
        }
{code}

This is causing clearing caches. 


[~apurtell] reverted HBASE-21775 on branch-1. Closing this one too.
