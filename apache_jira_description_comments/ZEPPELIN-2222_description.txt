This issue is about a new network visualization that can leverage the Property Graph Model (https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Property-Graph), but also simple graphs in order to provide a set of base apis that can be used by graph dbs (like Neo4j) or graph processing frameworks (like GraphX or Giraph).
