[~kmarton] thanks for the contribution! Please extract a method, inside that variables {{ret.buildInfo.replace(/=/g, \":\")}} and the next {{replace()}} with catchy names, as well as explain in a comment the meaning of this RegExp with some examples to improve readability and supportability. Thanks!

[~andras.piros], [~kmarton] I am pretty sure this issue is caused by OOZIE-2004, which has a follow-up ticket: OOZIE-3083. I believe OOZIE-3083 should be fixed first ([~gezapeti] do you think to have enough bandwidth to finish that patch)?

[~asasvari] thanks for the investigation!

[~asasvari] [~kmarton] while this issue is only about displaying the correct version number on the Oozie UI, I'd go for it first as it is a {{5.0.0-beta1}} blocker. Let's target OOZIE-3083 (the backwards compatibility JIRA) for {{5.0.0}} - when fixing that one, we need to take care of modifying the UI as well, if the underlying REST endpoint would change.

[~andras.piros] thanks for your answer. I still believe we shall not introduce this kind of workarounds. The real problem is that the response of {{v2/admin/build-version}} is not a JSON object. {{BaseAdminServlet}} should be fixed so that it uses ObjectMapper or something to return [valid JSON output|http://www.json.org/] for {{build.info}} too (use colon intead of =). OOZIE-3083 is almost finished.
