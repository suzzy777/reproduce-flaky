This seems to be long-standing, but the failure rate (~10%) is slightly higher in dist-test run in using cdh.
In both _08 and _09 tests:
# an attempt is made to make a replica in {{TEMPORARY}}
 state, by {{waitForTempReplica}}.
# Once that's returned, the test goes on to verify block reports shows correct pending replication blocks.

But there's a race condition. If the replica is replicated between steps #1 and #2, {{getPendingReplicationBlocks}} could return 0 or 1, depending on how many replicas are replicated, hence failing the test.
Failures are seen on both {{TestNNHandlesBlockReportPerStorage}} and {{TestNNHandlesCombinedBlockReport}}
