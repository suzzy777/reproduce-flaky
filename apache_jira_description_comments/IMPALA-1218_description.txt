This issues can be seen in the process failure test test_restart_statestore which is located in tests/experiments/test_process_failures.py

After the line:
impalad.service.wait_for_num_known_live_backends(CLUSTER_SIZE, timeout=60)

the statestore should be fully functioning. Without the addition of a sleep() call, however, the next method call:
self.execute_query_using_client(client, QUERY, vector)
fails.

Note: This bug is somewhat flaky. In my anecdotal experience it occurs 90% of the time.
