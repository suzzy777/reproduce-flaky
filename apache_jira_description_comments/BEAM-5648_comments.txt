[~boyuanz] I'm not as familiar with triaging failures, and I don't see any hints in the console output. Can you help me triage?

It seems the [pip download|https://github.com/apache/beam/blame/70259e13e83ce3e2bb8d9ee9731e09f9ff456b05/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/portability/stager.py#L411] command failed, but I don't see any command output. Is it this line from above:

{{Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement setuptools (from pyhamcrest->-r postcommit_requirements.txt (line 1)) (from versions: )}}

Sometimes this sort of error occurs because pypi is flaky. It may be the case here.

[~pabloem] is there somewhere that shows why the download failed (i.e. if pypi sent a bad HTTP response)? 

We want to identify post-commit flakiness and find ways to drive it down. So I'm trying to better understand the failures.

Qupta increased.

Just to be sure, why is this solved by the quota increase?
