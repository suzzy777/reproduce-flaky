OOZIE-2339 introducedÂ  a new way to submit a job: a new property should be added to the payload configuration XML with the name {{oozie.jobs.api.generated.xml}} and the content of the workload XML can be added as the value for the property.

This could be useful for other use cases (not only for Fluent Job API) so the REST API documentation should also list this job submission mode.
