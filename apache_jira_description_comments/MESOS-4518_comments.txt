commit 45d42f7dad2a1d11624c2b5c5e5bc3f24a99b656

    Fixed flaky MaxCompletedTasksPerFrameworkFlag test.

    Previously, this test was calling EXPECT_CALL() on
    SchedulerDriver.resourceOffers() after the scheduler driver itself had
    already been started. This resulted in flaky test results when offers
    came in between schedDriver.start() and the EXPECT_CALL().

    This commit fixes this test by moving the EXPECT_CALL() above the
    schedDriver.start() call. However, because of the nature of this test,
    this introduced a few complexities related to processing the incoming offers
    in a loop later on. To allow this, we had to introduce a custom gmock
    ACTION to enqueue offers in a process::Queue for later processing. This
    ACTION is generally useful and has been placed in src/tests/mesos.hpp.
