It seems that the problem is that since CASSANDRA-12653 {{MockMessagingSpy#mockedMessageResponses}} is increased asynchronously by [this thread|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/net/MatcherResponse.java#L185-L198]. Because of this the value of {{mockedMessageResponses}} can be checked before it has been increased by the thread, causing the reported failure. While the test doesn't fail very often, the failure can be easily reproduced by manually adding a sleep in the aforementioned thread.

The proposed PRs simply use {{spinAssertEquals}} to wait for the writer thread. Also, I think there could be thread safety issues when increasing {{mockedMessageResponses}} from different threads, so I'm making it an {{AtomicInteger}}.

The patches look good to me. I would simply also make {{MockMessagingSpy.messagesIntercepted}} an {{AtomicInteger}} for extra safety in the case we have some changes in the future that allow reads and writes with different threads but that change can be done on commit.

Thanks for the review, I'm running a final CI round with the {{AtomicInteger}} {{MockMessagingSpy.messagesIntercepted}}:
