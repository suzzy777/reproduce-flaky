IMPALA-11176: Fix Memory leak in ClientCacheHelper

The patch fixes a memory leak issue in client cache.

The memory leak happens because a shared pointer of the
base class "ThriftClientImpl" is created from a derived class
"ThriftClient" while the base class's destructor is non-virtual.
As a result, the shared pointer can't locate the correct
destructor, which should be the derived one, and leads to
memory leaks.

The way to fix in the patch is to make the destructor of
"ThriftClientImpl" virtual. Added testcase ClientCacheTest.

Tests:
Ran exhaustive tests.

IMPALA-11196 Fix ClientCacheTest ASAN and TSAN build failure

The testcase succeeds in DEBUG and RELEASE, but fails in ASAN and
TSAN build.

In the testcase's logic, it monitors whether there is a change
of the process vm size or not after several new and deletion of
objects in the system, because ASAN has replaced the alloc/free
interface, it may not guarantee the memory must be released to
the system immediately in ASAN. Similar case in TSAN.

The fix disables the testcase running in ASAN and TSAN, and the
running of this testcase in the DEBUG and RELEASE builds should
be enough for the verification of the memory leak problem in
IMPALA-11176.

Tests:
Reran testcase in ASAN and TSAN without errors.

IMPALA-11196 Fix a ClientCacheTest flaky test

The memory leak detection testcase is flaky, in local environment,
it could fail over 10 times out of 100. The fix changes to use
the ordinary ADD_BE_TEST to replace ADD_UNIFIED_BE_LSAN_TEST,
there could be some elements in the unified test which affect the
process vm size occasionally.

After the fix, the testcase ran 5000 times without a failure, and
can still catch the memory leak issue in IMPALA-11176.

Tests:
Ran Core Tests in DEBUG/RELEASE/ASAN build.
Ran consecutive 5000 times of the testcase and all passed.
