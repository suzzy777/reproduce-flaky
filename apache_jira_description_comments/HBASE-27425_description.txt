We currently run the flaky tests once per 4 hours and keep a backlog of 50 runs. That means it takes a perfect test a bit over 8 days to get back out of being penalized.

we regularly are leaving a bunch of executors idle (see attached PNG) and I think we should run the tests more often.

we use an executor per branch for a flaky test run. the duration depends on the specific tests that are flagged, but it has a timeout of 2 hours.

as an example the master branch tests currently take < 30 minutes (see other attached PNG).
