[~tarmstrong@cloudera.com] since you have looked at this before, is there a possibility that that the buffer only contains  't:21000] default> ' which causes the searcher to fail?

That looks like the immediate cause. I suspect the reason that the buffer only contains that is that "Fetched 1 row\(s\) in .*s" gobbled up the "[localhos" part of the prompt.

IMPALA-7415: Fix flakiness in test_multiline_queries_in_history

This fixes a flakiness in test_multiline_queries_in_history wherein a
part of the shell prompt would be absorbed in a previous regex search
that would ultimately result in the failure of the subsequent regex
search that looks for the prompt.

Also fixed a few formatting issues flagged by flake8.
