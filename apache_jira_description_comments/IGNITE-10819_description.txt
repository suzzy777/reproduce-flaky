As [test history|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&testNameId=-21180267941031641&tab=testDetails&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=%3Cdefault%3E] in master branch shows the test has become flaky around 18th of December.

It looks like test started failing when IGNITE-10555 was merged to master ([two flaky failures|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?tab=testDetails&projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&testNameId=-21180267941031641&page=8&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F5582%2Fhead] in the PR branch of this change also had place).

The reason of failure is timeout when *client4* node hangs awaiting for PME to complete. Communication failures are emulated in the test and when all clients fail to init an exchange on a specific affinity topology version (major=7, minor=1) everything works fine.
 But sometimes *client4* node manages to finish initialization of the exchange and hangs forever.
