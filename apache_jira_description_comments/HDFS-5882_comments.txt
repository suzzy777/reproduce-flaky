Can we force the logger to flush here? Looks like the current patch can only decrease the possibility of failure?

I was thinking to force-flush the logger to disk too, but there isn't an easy way. With the current patch, I don't see the problem any more locally.

Putting sleeps into tests like this is brittle.  Let's not go down that road.

If flushing is impossible, why not keep retrying reading the log for a fixed amount of time?  GenericTestUtils#waitFor can help with this.

Ok, let me take a look at that.

Posted v2 that force-flush the logs by closing the appenders. The flaky is mostly for the async-appender. Closing it will flush the logs.

+1, looks good to me.  javadoc warning is spurious
