I had to reopen this due to SPARK-7306

[~brkyvz] I am going to disable this test again, it is still failing even after SPARK-7224:

https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark/job/Spark-1.4-Maven-pre-YARN/hadoop.version=2.0.0-mr1-cdh4.1.2,label=centos/235/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.deploy/SparkSubmitSuite/includes_jars_passed_in_through___packages/

I don't understand why that's failing. It's not related to --packages per se, it's more like, we can't run Spark Submit anymore. That's why the test above, --jars also fails sometimes.

I'm going to keep this open for a while since we haven't actually done anything to fix the test itself. If it remains flaky then we should ignore the tests again.

+ and spend some time to actually rewrite it.
