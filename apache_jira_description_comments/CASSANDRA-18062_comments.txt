The PR for this patch is here: https://github.com/maedhroz/cassandra/pull/9

Minor note: I had forgotten to actually push the trunk rebase for the CASSANDRA-16052 feature branch on the 19th. That's done, so the branch here will need a quick rebase.

I have rebased the CASSANDRA-18062 against the rebased CASSANDRA-16052 branch.

[~mfleming] Just to be clear, this is almost certainly not going to land in any 4.x release, and if [~mike_tr_adamson] is okay w/ it, I’d suggest we just use the NA version here and later inherit the main CEP-7 version when that’s finalized in the epic Jira/ticket.

[~maedhroz] Sure can do. I was just monkeying about with the versions to create a simpler kanban board, but I'm happy to use NA here.

[~mike_tr_adamson] [~adelapena] I've thrown my +1 on the PR

There are a number of Jiras we've agreed to spin off and handle separately, so modulo getting those created and making sure we're clean on tests (I can rebase if we have things failing because of trunk divergence...let me know), things are looking pretty good here.

Changes look good to me too, I have only left a few final nits on the PR.

As for testing, there are too many modified files for the automatic CircleCI repeated runs but I can start a few runs repeating the modified tests in batches. It might be preferable to do so after rebase, if we are going to rebase now.

This is the latest test run on [CircleCI|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/mike-tr-adamson/cassandra/129/workflows/ffae16e7-9b23-42ef-8d6f-f47aafcb6a4b]. The failures seem unrelated to SAI so I don't whether rebase first of merge first. I'm happy with either.

Just reviewed the last clean-up commit.

+1 overall

Let's squash it, fix up the commit message, and merge this thing!

Once it's merged, I'll rebase the 16052 branch, run the tests, and report back.

I think we should run the repeated tests before merging, so we make sure we don't introduce new flakies.

I have started part of the repeated runs [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra?branch=18062-trunk-test]. Each push on that branch is for running a subset of the new or modified tests.

So far it has hit test failures on [{{StorageAttachedIndexDDLTest.concurrentTruncateWithIndexBuilding}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2835/workflows/8301fcae-ab73-401d-ae26-d3e7e8b0f237/jobs/38519/tests] and [{{CompactionTest.testConcurrentIndexDropWithCompaction}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2828/workflows/c22d9dc8-9af1-493f-9e13-e91631fd2386/jobs/38538/tests]. I'll keep running the rest of the tests to see if there are more flakies.

Even if we do have a couple flakes, they're only merging to the 16052 umbrella branch, where I'd be running the repeats again after the next trunk rebase. If they're trivial to resolve now before merge though, that's fine too.

These are the new flaky tests once all the CI runs have finished:

The runs use 100 repetitions per job.

I have looked at StorageAttachedIndexDDLTest#concurrentTruncateWithIndexBuilding and CompactionTest#testConcurrentIndexDropWithCompaction (just because they were mentioned in the first comment). I ran each test > 100 times locally with no failure. I will run the rest of the above locally to see if I can identify any obvious failures and then start investigating the rest.

I fully agree that all of these need fixing before we merge to trunk but I would prefer if we could work on these in parallel to the work on the main tickets in 16052.

[~adelapena] WDYT to this option? I am happy if you would prefer to have these fixed prior to the merge.

I agree to merge this to the feature branch without fixing the flakies, so we can parallelize work.

Most of the found flakies only fail once or twice, Thus, the mandatory minimum number of repeated runs when merging CASSANDRA-16052 is likely to not hit all of them. So let's keep around the above list of flakies, so we can give them more CI rounds before merging the feature branch to trunk.

The CircleCI config to run these flakies can be created by removing [these lines|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/.circleci/generate.sh#L212-L218] in {{generate.sh}} to disable the automatic detection of tests and manually specifying the tests to be repeated:
{code:java}
.circleci/generate.sh -p \
  -e REPEATED_UTESTS_COUNT=500 \
  -e REPEATED_UTESTS=org.apache.cassandra.index.sai.cql.DecimalLargeValueTest,org.apache.cassandra.index.sai.cql.MixedIndexImplementationsTest,org.apache.cassandra.index.sai.cql.StorageAttachedIndexDDLTest,org.apache.cassandra.index.sai.disk.SelectiveIntersectionTest,org.apache.cassandra.index.sai.functional.CompactionTest,org.apache.cassandra.index.sai.metrics.FinalSegmentFlushingFailureTest \
  -e REPEATED_JVM_DTESTS_COUNT=500 \
  -e REPEATED_JVM_DTESTS=org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.sai.IndexAvailabilityTest
{code}
I have started such run [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2843/workflows/87ec9c0e-9c87-4d97-ab8d-45beaad12088]. [The config|https://github.com/adelapena/cassandra/commit/0f534d5880f9802c85b1bdced2916a6daf1e471d] can be reused when trying to fix the flakies, possibly altering the number of repetitions to whatever we feel comfortable with.

[~adelapena] Thanks for this. I have just pushed a fix for some of the flaky tests. These are:

* DecimalLargeValueTest - wasn't waiting for index to be created in test
* MixedIndexImplementationsTest - wasn't waiting for index to be created in test
* SelectiveIntersectionTest - wasn't waiting for index to be created in test
* FinalSegmentFlushingFailureTest - was using JMX unnecessarily to get metrics

The index creation wait issue is a common issue I have found. Once we have the numeric tests in place I will do a search of all the tests to make sure that they are correctly waiting where needed.

The remaining tests appear to be concurrency related and will need more investigation. I have investigated an fixed some of these in the past so will track down those fixes and see what was done.

I will do a final test run and then start the squash and merge.

Here is the [current|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/mike-tr-adamson/cassandra/130/workflows/d9a29bba-27ec-4ae4-a280-4d18cd87592a] test run. I will start on the squash, push and run again. If that run is satisfactory then we can merge. 

I think the above run has multiple failures on dtests because it's testing an old trunk against the current version of Python dtests.

That makes multiple permission-related dtests fail because the cassandra branch doesn't have the new {{UNMASK}} and {{SELECT_MASKED}} permissions that were introduced with dynamic data masking (CASSANDRA-17940). They should work after rebase.

Maybe we should also have feature branch for python-dtests, parallel to the one at {{{}[https://github.com/maedhroz/cassandra/tree/CASSANDRA-16052]{}}}?

I'll report back in CASSANDRA-16052 on the overall test picture after a trunk rebase...
