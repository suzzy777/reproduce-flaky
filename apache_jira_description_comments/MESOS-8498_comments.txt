    Fixed Docker command health check to use the given socket.

    The original command health check was calling `docker exec` instead
    of `docker -H <docker_socket> exec`, so it was ignoring the socket
    value passed to the docker executor.

    Added separate structs for health check runtime and check types.

    health check code.

    Refactored health checks to cleanly separate each different check.

    Refactored health check code to separate the logic for each check
    type and runtime (Plain/Docker/Nested). Now the matrix of different
    possibilities is cleanly enumerated, making it easier to add
    future health checks, such as the ones for Windows.

    The `name` field was moved to fix a reorder warning.

    Moved Docker command check code inside health check library.

    Now with the health check library refactor, the wrapping of `docker
    exec` for the Docker command health checks can be easily moved inside
    the library.

    Fixed quoting bug in Docker executor command checks.

    The docker executor was wrapping the `docker exec` command with
    `sh -c ""`, which was causing problems due to quoting, especially on
    Windows. Now, the command health check simply runs `docker exec`
    without any wrapping.

    Windows: Enabled Docker health checks.

    The network health checks called `curl` and then executed `setns()` to
    enter to container network namespace, which did not work on Windows.
    To do the equivalent, Windows now calls `docker run` with PowerShell's
    `curl` equivalent, `Invoke-WebRequest`, and uses the
    `network=container:<ID>` flag to enter the container's namespace. The
    command health check was trivially fixed by replacing the hard-coded
    `sh -c`.

    Added Docker constants and common functions file.

    This patch is in preparation of porting Docker tests to Windows. There
    were a few hard-coded values that were used throughout the codebase,
    such as the `alpine` image, that are defined as a constant in a single
    file.

    Windows: Ported Docker health check tests.

commit 81c724ecf
Author: Akash Gupta <akash-gupta@hotmail.com>
Date:   Sun Feb 25 13:36:55 2018 -0800

    Moved `DOCKER` tests to `DockerContainerizerHealthCheckTest`.

    In `health_check_tests.cpp`, the tests matching `*DOCKER*` were moved
    to `DockerContainerizerHealthCheckTest::Setup` so that pre-pulling
    only happens if the test is actually run. This avoids failing the test
    suite due to the pull failing when `docker` isn't installed.

    To expand on why this change was necessary: each `DOCKER` test
    requires (a) Docker to be available and (b) the images to be pulled.
    The `DOCKER` test filter correctly satisfies (a), that is, if `docker`
    isn't available, then the test isn't run. However, the previous logic
    had the image pulling in `SetUpTestCase`, which was run once for the
    whole test suite, and therefore wasn't affected by the `DOCKER`
    filter, meaning `docker pull` would run (and fail) if `docker` wasn't
    installed, since the suite had tests other than `DOCKER` tests.

    So we need the `docker pull` logic to be executed if and only if
    Docker is available. We already have logic for checking this on a
    per-test basis, the `DOCKER` filter. So the code was moved to `SetUp`,
    which is run for each test. The code is in essence idempotent: once
    the images are pulled, pulling again is a no-op since they're
    cached (and the logging is done with `LOG_FIRST_N(..., 1)`).
    Furthermore, the tests were constrained to a suite consisting of all
    `DOCKER` tests (the `DockerContainerizerHealthCheckTests`), and it's
    reasonable to assume that all tests added to this suite will use the
    `DOCKER` filter.

    Windows: Fixed flaky Docker command health check test.

    The `DockerContainerizerHealthCheckTest.ROOT_DOCKER_
    DockerHealthStatusChange` test was flaky on Windows, because
    the Docker executor manually reaps the container exit code in
    case that `docker run` fails to get the exit code. This logic
    doesn't work on Windows, since the process might not be visible to
    the container host machine, causing `TASK_FAILED` to get sent. By
    removing the reaping logic on Windows, the test is much more reliable.
