We have few consistent tests failing in branch-1.3 and I would like to get that fix in the release.
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-23000 I have PR ready for review. Thanks !

Here's how I work through comparing changes logged in git and those accounted for in jira as of the 1.4.11 RCs. The goal is for jira to be the source of truth so that we can use it to generate release notes. HBASE-14025 has steps for doing the comparison for a new minor release. This is specific to a maintenance release.

1. Make a text file with the list of jiras in the fix version
  - Browse to project home -> versions -> 1.4.11 -> Release Notes -> Configure Release Notes -> format: text -> Create (leads to these [text release notes for 1.4.11|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12345617&styleName=Text&projectId=12310753&Create=Create]
  - the text box at the bottom will have the contents to copy
  - filter to just have jira keys (this example is OS X specific)
{code}
pbpaste | grep -o -E "\[HBASE-[0-9]*\]" | grep -o -E "HBASE-[0-9]*" | sort -u > ~/tmp/hbase-release-process/CHANGES_1.4.11_jira.txt
{code}

2. Make a test file with the list of jiras in git commit messages
{code}
$ git checkout branch-1.4
$ git log --oneline rel/1.4.10...HEAD | grep -o -E '^[^ ]* HBASE-[0-9]* ' | grep -o -E 'HBASE-[0-9]*' | sort -u > ~/tmp/hbase-release-process/CHANGES_1.4.11_git.txt
{code}

3. use the two files to list those things in jira but not git
{code}
$ comm -1 -3 ~/tmp/hbase-release-process/CHANGES_1.4.11_git.txt ~/tmp/hbase-release-process/CHANGES_1.4.11_jira.txt 
{code}

4. use the two files to list those things in git but not in jira
{code}
$ comm -2 -3 ~/tmp/hbase-release-process/CHANGES_1.4.11_git.txt ~/tmp/hbase-release-process/CHANGES_1.4.11_jira.txt 
{code}

Next I checked the untrusted test list for the branch to make sure nothing was consistently failing (and found out something is :( )

[https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/]

FYI [~sakthi] the branch-1.3 version of HBASE-22874  has landed.

Thanks [~busbey] for prioritizing this one.

Update: RC0 tag has been created. - [https://github.com/apache/hbase/releases/tag/1.3.6RC0]

Will generate the docs and deploy by tomorrow if no hiccups

Update:

-Artifacts have been staged in the mvn repo - [https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachehbase-1363/]

-Bin & Source tarballs ready. 

 

Pending:

Need to sign, fingerprint and stage the RC build output director to the dev distribution directory via svn. I don't think I would have enough rights to write into it (I think just the PMCs have the write access). [~busbey] might have few ideas over here :)

Will attaching the files here work? Then I could put them into the rc svn

Have uploaded the files in gdrive. Here's the link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/15su2K_-EKDoSzwZDIuOR47ggvlXELP3_/view?usp=sharing] let's see if this works! [~busbey]

that works!

here's the RC on the dev area: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/hbase/hbase-1.3.6RC0/

Thanks [~busbey]. Glad that it worked. Could please do the same for the api_compat report? Here's the link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-wPSO7HkVqaiS7klRgOuMJxd8KiDuUdY/view?usp=sharing] 

all set.

You might want HBASE-23174, but not critical if we are going to do a 1.3.7.

I had to pass RC0 Sean. Here's the link for RC1: [https://s.apache.org/bnprb] . Could you please help me with getting this into the svn? Thanks.

HBASE-23174 is now present in RC1, [~apurtell]

here you go: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/hbase/hbase-1.3.6RC1/

Thanks Sean!

RC1 passed. 
 * Pushed rel/1.3.6 tag at commit - 806dc3625c
 * Published nexus repo - [https://repository.apache.org/#nexus-search;gav~org.apache.hbase~~1.3.6~~]
 * Moved the version on to 1.3.7-SNAPSHOT

Pending : 
 * Release date on CHANGES.txt - pending
 * Remove release/hbase/1.3.5 - pending
 * svn mv dev/hbase/hbase-1.3.6RC1 release/hbase/1.3.6 under URL: [https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist] - pending
 * svn commit. - pending
 * Update the download page - pending

[~busbey], could you please help me with the svn part of the pending things, so that I can proceed ahead with the remaining ones.?

 

done:

* svn mv dev/hbase/hbase-1.3.6RC1 release/hbase/1.3.6 under URL: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist - pending
* svn commit. - pending
* Remove release/hbase/1.3.5

Thanks Sean.
 * Updated the changes file with the release date
 * Created PR for updating of the downloads page with 1.3.6.

 

IIRC once the PR goes in, this Jira can be closed (with announce mail sent) unless there aren't any other steps involved. What say [~busbey]?

* reporter.a.o needs to have the release entered
* Jira needs the version marked released


Let me know if you don't have access rights for either. 

* Downloads page pr is merged now. Thanks for the review Sean.
 * Jira 1.3.6 version has been marked released now.
 * reporter.a.o needs pmc permissions: "{color:#de350b}_It doesn't look like you are on any PMCs_{color}"

Downloads page now shows 1.3.6 entries after hbase_generate_website/1823/

release data manager specifically, on the off chance it has different access needs:

https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?hbase

I added 1.3.6 as released on 2019-10-20.

Thanks Sean! Because I have used 10/19 as the date of release in downloads page and change.txt I have updated the date to 10/19 in reporter.a.o as well. Let me announce the release now. 

Announcement email has been sent out now! Will file a Jira to come back to review the status of 1.3 line in around a month or so to mark EOL for 1.3.

because releases are a business process of the foundation, they need to be dated according to that process. The authoritative date for a release is when the artifacts are placed in the subversion repo backing dist.a.o.

so for 1.3.6 if we look at the log

And see that the source artifact arrived in the release area at 2019-10-20. It only really matters for our board report and I think that pulls from reporter.a.o.

Ahh! That makes sense. It's sad that I overlooked that part. My apologies. Thanks Sean for that piece of information. Let me go ahead and change the release date in the downloads page.

I think we can make the change in change.txt as well but now that rel/1.3.6 is already set at one of the prev commit and the pom versions have been moved to 1.3.7-SNAPSHOT, I don't know if we would still want to update the rel/1.3.6 to this latest commit (of the updated release date?). I think, no is the answer? 

that's correct. generally {{rel/}} tags don't change. And the file as it is in that tag is how it was when the release was voted on, so it's pointing at the right place.

I'd say updating it in CHANGES.txt in branch-1.3 for the future is okay. The reporter date (and maybe the jira date) are the ones more folks will see anyways.

Sure I'll go ahead and make the changes in downloads page, Jira & changes.txt and close this Jira .
