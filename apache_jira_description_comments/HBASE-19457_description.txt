Trying to explain the bug in a more general way where understanding of ProcedureV2 is not required.

Truncating table operation:
....
delete region states from meta
delete table state from meta
....
add new regions to meta with state null.
....crash
....recovery: TableStateManager treats table with null state as ENABLED. AM treats regions with null state as offline. Combined result - AM starts assigning the new regions from incomplete truncate operation.

Fix: Mark table as disabled instead of deleting it's state.

*patch1*
Just added some logging to help with debugging:
- 60s was too less time, increased timeout
- Added some useful log statements
