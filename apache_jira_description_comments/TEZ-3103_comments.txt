Attaching a patch that bumps the commitMemory accordingly when the mem-to-mem merge target segment is closed.

Oops, I attached the wrong version of the patch, as the original test case was flaky.  Attaching a new version which should have a more reliable unit test.

+1. lgtm. Thanks [~jlowe]

Thanks for the review, Rajesh!  I committed this to master and branch-0.7.

Closing as 0.7.1 released.
