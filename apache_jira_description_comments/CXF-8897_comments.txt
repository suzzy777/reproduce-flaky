[~agitatra] when you say `When calling maven on the latest master of CXF several errors occur`, what exactly the command you use? The one which should work is `mvn clean install`

For tests, please check https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-8393 - we are aware of certain flaky tests

[~reta] the command I mentioned in the headline:
 * mvn clean package verify

Do you mean "install" would solve the problem with the missing files in the local repo?

Whith latest master I mean, checking "master" out, and pulling.

Thanks [~agitatra] 

> Do you mean "install" would solve the problem with the missing files in the local repo?

Yes and all other issues (besides flaky tests)

[~reta], ok will try.

Regarding the "flaky tests".  Is there a way to treat them like a warning, meaning flag but continue, I saw some errors in the maven process that do that, however I tried to apply that to other issues but failed.

You could use `-fae` flag - not exactly the warning but the build will continue for other modules: mvn clean install -fae

[~reta], thanks: "install" works, and thank you for the "--fail-at-end" hint..

[~agitatra] I am closing this issue, the tests are tracked separately
