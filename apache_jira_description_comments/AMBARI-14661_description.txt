These tests are flaky and fail intermittently:  
<https://builds.apache.org/job/Ambari-trunk-Commit/4156/testReport/>  
<https://builds.apache.org/job/Ambari-trunk-Commit/4135/testReport/>

If this is difficult to stabilize these, we need to suppress them and file a
TODO ticket to fix in a later release.
