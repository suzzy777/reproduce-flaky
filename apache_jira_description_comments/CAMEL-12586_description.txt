Seems that our daily build fails as the {{maven-surefire-plugin}} configured in JDK 9+ profile requires a version of {{jaxb-core}} that's no(t) (longer) available on Maven Central. And with SUREFIRE-1330 in 2.22.0 it opens the use of JUnit5 in Camel.

Might be worth taking a look and use the same {{maven-surefire-plugin}} versions across all modules, some seem to be using version 2.19.1.
