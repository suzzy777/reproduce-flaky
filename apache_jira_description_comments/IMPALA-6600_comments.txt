This is for sure not an Impala product or infrastructure issue. It's most like a bug in pytest-xdist 1.15.0:
https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/124

The patch for this issue has been available since xdist 1.17.1 (although the latest version is 1.22.2.) We could try to upgrade the xdist dependency to see if the problem goes away.

Since this appears to be an intermittent flaky test problem related to a bug in a dependent python library, I'm going to downgrade the priority from Blocker.

I feel like this is a duplicate of IMPALA-7008.
