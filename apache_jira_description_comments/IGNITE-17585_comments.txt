Tests was unstable due to session expiration period just 1 ms and periodically GC consume the timeand query doesn't start. The second potential issue of the test using Thread.sleep itself instead of waitForCondition. To fix the second part has been inroduced ability retrieve information about live sessions, which will be usefull for future functionality like a VIEW with a active sessions.
