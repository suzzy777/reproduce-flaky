Now that CASSANDRA-15399 is in, most of the repair messages have a state that they can check against to make message delivery idempotent, allowing the coordinator to retry such messages; a few of the most critical messages to retry are: PREPARE_MSG, VALIDATION_REQ, VALIDATION_RSP, SYNC_REQ, and SYNC_RSP.

With this I propose making the coordinator able to retry these key messages to try and make repair more resilient to ephemeral issues.
