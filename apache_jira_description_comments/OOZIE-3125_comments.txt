We should make sure that in init() of JPAService {{sql.enforce_strict_size=true}} is set in the TestDBLoadDump tests. I tested from my debugger if I set
{code}
props.setProperty("openjpa.ConnectionProperties", "DriverClassName=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver,Url=jdbc:hsqldb:mem:oozie-db;sql.enforce_strict_size=true;create=true,MaxActive=10,TestOnBorrow=false,TestOnReturn=false,TestWhileIdle=false, ")
{code}
before {{factory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(persistentUnit, props)}}

After reviewing {{XTestCase.java}}, it turns out tools tests use {{hsqld-oozie-site.xml}} from the core module, so we shouldsimply  set "sql.enforce_strict_size=true" there. After this {{TestDBLoadDump.testImportInvalidDataLeavesTablesEmpty}} passes.

Thanks for the findings [~asasvari], this is a very useful piece of investigation! Now it will be simpler to fix this issue.

[~andras.piros] can you take a look?


Thanks for the contribution [~asasvari]! +1 (pending Jenkins)

[~andras.piros] thanks for the review, committed to master.

There are 10+ recent [*unit test failures*|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-OOZIE-Build/240/testReport/] that are related to the fact that now every time we amend {{;sql.enforce_strict_size=true}} to HSQLDB {{oozie.service.JPAService.jdbc.url}}. I suggest we only change it e.g. in {{tools}} where most of those are not affected.

Thanks for reporting this issue [~andras.piros]. The green test report was confusing:
{code}
. Tests run: 0
. Tests rerun: 0
{code}

Also 0 test was running for [OOZIE-2296|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE-2296]... It shall be fixed asap. 

Amendment patch:
- New oozie site xml, hsqldb-tools-oozie-site.xml, with sql.enforce_strict_size=true, used in TestDBLoadDump tests
- Executed tests: {{mvn clean test  -Dtest=TestCoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand,TestConfigurationService,TestCoordActionMissingDependenciesXCommand,TestCoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand,TestDBLoadDump -Denforcer.skip=true -Dcheckstyle.skip=true -Dfindbugs.skip=true}}

- {{test-patch}} is not able to collect number of tests executed test results after https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE-3106 (surefire plugin update). We need an amendment patch or fix it here.
