when we used hiveserver1 based on hive-0.10.0, we found the Exception thrown.It was:

FAILED: Error in metadata: MetaException(message:java.lang.RuntimeException: commitTransaction was called but openTransactionCalls = 0. This probably indicates that the
re are unbalanced calls to openTransaction/commitTransaction)
FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask
