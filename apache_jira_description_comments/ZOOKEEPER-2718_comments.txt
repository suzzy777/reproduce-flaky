    ZOOKEEPER-2718: fix flaky StandaloneDisabledTest

    The flaky (that existing for a long time) is caused by a ghost server that although not appear in the quorum's config but still up and running and send requests to the quorum {2, 3, 4}. Fix is simply kill the server 1 after it's used. Verified that with the fix the test survive stress test (100+ runs) while w/o the fix the tests fails frequently, on internal Jenkins machine.
    
    ZOOKEEPER-2718: build bot do something please.
