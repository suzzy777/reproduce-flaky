There are currently a number of tests for `DataSerializer.writeString` and `DataSerializer.readString`, which cover many of the corner cases we expect for string serialization/deserialization, but it would be nice to have randomized testing that generated Unicode strings and verified that they were the same after being serialized and deserialized.
