[~zjffdu] Hi, AFAIK, In "Shared" mode for LivyInterpreter, it support impersonation for now. I just wonder if why you support scoped mode.

For livy, impersonation is handled in livy side, not in zeppelin side. 

Yes, I know. Do you think it's necessary to support impersonation in Zeppelin side as well?

I am not sure whether zeppelin's impersonation works for livy. Because currently livy interpreter just use rest api to communicate with livy server, it is different from other interpreter implementation.  BTW, which ticket adding impersonation to zeppelin, I can take a look at it to confirm that. 

Currently, Zeppelin has no umbrella issue for impersonation but some issues are in progress. I think you already know the Spark's one.

Yes, I see that PR, but I don't think that PR resolve the impersonation. 

Yes, I agree with you. We will find a proper way to solve it.

    @Leemoonsoo @bzz @felixcheung Finally I got the livy integration test passed (failed test is flaky test, not related to this PR). I have to run livy integration test separately. Because the travis docker container has 3 gb memory limitation, the maven build process will be killed if I put livy integration test with others. Several other livy PR depends on this PR, so I hope get this PR merge first and plan to do the improvement of `.travis.yml` in a following PR.

    LGTM and merge to master if there're no more comment.
