Flaky: random ports, async actions, time sensitive

If either of the waitForCriterions fail to complete within 1 minute, test will fail. One long GC pause would cause a failure. If a random port is in use by the time the test uses it, then it'll fail with a BindException (possibly in a background thread).


When the fetch task threads are spawned in the client metadata service for single hop, It is possible that certain thread is still lingering during the second round of PUTs, which assumes all such fetch tasks should be completed at that time. The lingering thread causes the isMetadataRefreshed_TEST_ONLY flag to be set during second round of PUTs, which results in test failure.
