This issue is P2 but has been unassigned without any comment for 60 days so it has been labeled "stale-P2". If this issue is still affecting you, we care! Please comment and remove the label. Otherwise, in 14 days the issue will be moved to P3.

Please see https://beam.apache.org/contribute/jira-priorities/ for a detailed explanation of what these priorities mean.


This doesn't read as a regression, but as something to be resolved eventually? If this currently works in 2.25, but not in the 2.26 candidate, then it should be fixed, but otherwise it's an unrelated improvement.

Ah, I note that this was affecting 2.24, so I'm going to remove the fix version.

This issue was marked "stale-P2" and has not received a public comment in 14 days. It is now automatically moved to P3. If you are still affected by it, you can comment and move it back to P2.

This may be partially "fixed" (depending on use-case, such as the need to suppress certain error types) by the PR for BEAM-12093[1] (once merged) which adds a user-configurable option called `withAllowableResponseErrors`. One known use-case for that is suppressing version engine errors when using an `external` version type.Â 

That said, it's definitely a goal of mine in the future to implement the pattern initially described in this ticket where failed Vs. successful writes could be retrieved via TupleTag.

2.34.0 was cut on 10/06. As this ticket is not a blocker, I don't cherry pick it and plan it for 2.35.0
