{color:#222222}I noticed in some of my writing jobs that the BufferedMutator would get stuck retrying writes against a dead server.{color}
{code:java}
19/01/18 15:15:47 INFO [Executor task launch worker for task 0] client.AsyncRequestFutureImpl: #2, waiting for 1  actions to finish on table: dummy_table

{code}
 

After the single remaining action permanently failed, it would resume progress only to get stuck again retrying against the same dead server:
{code:java}
19/01/18 15:21:18 INFO [Executor task launch worker for task 0] client.AsyncRequestFutureImpl: #2, waiting for 1  actions to finish on table: dummy_table

{code}
 

Only restarting the client process to generate a new BufferedMutator instance would fix the issue, at least until the next regionserver crash

 The logs I've pasted show the issue happening with a ConnectionTimeoutException, but we've also seen it with NotServingRegionException and some others
