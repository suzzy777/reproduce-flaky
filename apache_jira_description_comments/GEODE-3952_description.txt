Spotless currently addresses whitespacing and very little else.  It could be expanded to clean up the more glaring (in my opinion) broken windows.  This includes:

* Adherence to the established import ordering given in `[geode]/etc/`
* Adherence to the established modifier ordering given in the Google Java Style guide, which we largely adopt.  (e.g., `public static int` over `static public int`.)
* Removal of some dead code, particularly commented-out import statements.
* Improvements to whitespace handling, particularly to end files in a single carriage return and to trim whitespace from the end of each line.

Increase to compile time is trivial, approximately ten seconds in the worst case.
