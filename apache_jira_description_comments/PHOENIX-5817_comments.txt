I've attached the fix, but as always, the prepatch script cannot test itself.

[~stoty] guess this is the reason for [PHOENIX-5754|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-5754] FYI [~neha.gupta]

Committed to master. (as prepatch always runs from master)

Thanks for the review [~ckulkarni]


Now I see that this was already discovered and discussed in PHOENIX-5754. 
Well, at least I got to create a ticket with a funny name.
