seeing the same error intermittently, the weird thing is I sometimes also see it error with below, like its not converting the collection or maybe its still a timing issue, but I had increased the timeout from 10 seconds to 30 seconds as well.

org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: ArrayBuffer(0) did not equal List(0) at org.scalatest.Assertions.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:528) at org.scalatest.Assertions.newAssertionFailedException$(Assertions.scala:527) at org.scalatest.FunSuite.newAssertionFailedException(FunSuite.scala:1560) at org.scalatest.Assertions$AssertionsHelper.macroAssert(Assertions.scala:501) at org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGSchedulerSuite.$anonfun$new$144(DAGSchedulerSuite.scala:2656)

I also hit this issue today. It's the same with Thomas's situation `ArrayBuffer(0)`.

Hit this again.
