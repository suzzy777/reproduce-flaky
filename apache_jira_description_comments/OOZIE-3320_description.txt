bash files that saved on shared mount, cannot be execute by the ShellAction in proper way.

Example:

Worker-1,Worker-2,Worker-3 have shared mount /mnt/hadoop

on /mnt/hadoop there is a file script.sh

Right now there is two options to submit it using ShellAction:
 # Upload it to hdfs, add it as a file and submit script.sh
 # use bash as exec and file location (/mnt/hadoop/script.sh) as argument (e.g <exec>bash>/exec><argument>/mnt/hadoop/script.sh</argument>

Best option is that the <exec> command will support shared mounted file :

<exec>/mnt/hadoop/script.sh</exec>

 

This code is taking only the file name instead it full path:
{code:java}
String exec = actionXml.getChild("exec", ns).getTextTrim(); 
String execName = new Path(exec).getName(); actionConf.set(ShellMain.CONF_OOZIE_SHELL_EXEC, execName);
{code}
 

Best option to support shared mount file is to support file:// starting for bash files that are local (or shared by mount), e.g:
{code:java}
String exec = actionXml.getChild("exec", ns).getTextTrim(); String execName; String localFilePrefix = "file://";
 // When exec starts with 'file://' refer it as local file. 
if (exec.startsWith(localFilePrefix)) 
execName = exec.substring(localFilePrefix.length()); 
else execName = new Path(exec).getName(); actionConf.set(ShellMain.CONF_OOZIE_SHELL_EXEC, execName);
{code}
