GEODE-5065: Add awaitability to testServerUpFirstClientLater (#1792)



This just failed again. I'm going to bump up the timeout and hope it doesn't show up again.

GEODE-5065 Increase timeout for a flaky distributed test. And cleanup. (#1821)

GEODE-5065 Increase timeout for a flaky distributed test.

* remove duplicate/unneeded methods and fields
* make a lot of methods private
* Don't use the reflection-based `invoke` form
* Change some CacheSerializableRunnables with misleading description
  text to plain ol' lambdas.
* Simplify waiting logic.
* Merge all the registration methods into one.
* We don't need more than three registered DataSerializers per test;
  remove the others.
* Remove single data serializer test because it's redundant.

I'm not entirely sure this will fix all the issues but at least the code is more readable now.
