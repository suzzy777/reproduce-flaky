We do not have UTs for this two commands? IIRC I did not see any failures on the hbase-shell UTs.

[~zhangduo], we do have unit tests for both these cases in TestAdminShell.java. These shell unit tests are actually the reason that one of my open PRs ([https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/2232]) is failing CI testing.

I just took a look at the nightly build for both JDK 8 and 11. hbase-shell is passing for both of them. (/)

I think the problem is that *TestAdminShell is not always run in CI*. It was definitely run for my recently opened PR. However, *TestAdminShell now appears in the list of flaky excludes* for the master branch, so it is not being run on nightly builds. This may have other effects, but I'm not familiar enough with our CI to comment further at the moment. See [https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dashboard.html]

I'll have a chance to look into this further tomorrow.

OK. Thank you for taking a look of this.

One of the things that fascinated me about this bug is that it only *affects the JDK 11 builds*. The JDK 8 builds work just fine. Hopefully, I'll get the chance to look into this more, but my initial guess is that this effect is a result of "JEP 181: Nest-Based Access Control," added in JDK 11 (See the release notes: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk-11-relnote.html#JDK-8010319).]

Anyway, there are two changes that need to be made:

1. We need a new way to accept coprocessor spec strings from the alter command. I suggested a solution on this issue relating to CoprocessorDescriptors:Â [HBASE-20119|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-20119?focusedCommentId=17178013&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17178013]
 2. We need a new way to print table attributes in the describe command. This is easy.

Thanks for the fix [~bitoffdev]
