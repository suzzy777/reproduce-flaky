Results cleaned up already but I saw this fail again (on a different 2.4-targeted PR, also Java 8)

Note that this test is distinct from the similar flaky test AdminClientIntegrationTest.testCreatePartitions, and does not duplicateÂ KAFKA-9069

This is resolved by the PR targeted for KAFKA-9069. Thanks to [~huxi_2b]
