We should write tests for the {{DefaultExecutor}} to cover the following common scenarios:

# -Start a task that uses a GPU, and make sure that it is made available to the task.-
# -Launch a Docker task with a health check.-
# -Launch two tasks and verify that they can access a volume owned by the Executor via {{sandbox_path}} volumes.-
# -Launch two tasks, each one in its own task group, and verify that they can access a volume owned by the Executor via {{sandbox_path}} volumes.-
# -Launch a task that uses an env secret, make sure that it is accessible.-
# -Launch a task using a URI and make sure that the artifact is accessible.-
# -Launch a task using a Docker image + URIs, make sure that the fetched artifact is accessible.-
# Launch one task and ensure that (health) checks can read from a persistent volume.
# -Ensure that the executor's env is NOT inherited by the nested tasks.-
