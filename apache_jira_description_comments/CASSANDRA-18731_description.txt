Currently we have a somewhat declarative structure in .circleci, however there's still quite a bit that's baked in (resource limitations, parallelism, which suites qualify for which pipelines (pre-commit vs. post-commit vs. ???), etc). Further, while CASSANDRA-18133 brings the build scripts in-tree, all these parameters (pipelines, env vars, job definitions, resource constraints) are all still scattered throughout the shell scripts and/or reliant on the {{JenkinsFile}} to determine what suites comprise what pipelines.

This ticket aims to decouple the definition of pipelines and jobs for CI from the implementations themselves. The goal here is to define, establish, and test both the base config and some helper methods to provide _other_ configurations (circle, ASF CI, etc) the tools they need to programmatically inherit base CI config from a purely declarative structure.

Follow-up tickets will involve rewriting the in-tree build scripts and JenkinsFile generation to rely on this structure, as well as integrating the config parsing unit tests into our CI.
