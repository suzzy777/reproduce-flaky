   before, we ran Build, then all <x>Test jobs in parallel (which takes ~5 hours), then all Benchmark<x> jobs (which takes ~5 hours).
   
   Presumably the benchmarks were run after all tests, on the premise that benchmarks are meaningless if the code is not correct.  However, required PR checks now prevent incorrect code from getting into develop in the first place, and the remaining occasional failures are flaky, so it's rather arbitrary to gate benchmarks on a lottery.
   
   However, faster feedback has clear benefits, hence this PR to cut our CI pipeline from 10 hours to 5 hours.
   
   Also eliminates redundant jobs (ApiCheck and UnitTest are deterministic and already have required JDK11 flavors in the PR pipeline, so JDK8 flavor only is more than sufficient in the develop pipeline)
   
   Also decreases benchmarks max_in_flight from 3 to 2, since now that we have support branches, we don't want to max our quota just from develop.  Some sort of global "pool" resource might be a more elegant way to manage this resource quota across pipelines.
