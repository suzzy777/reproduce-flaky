NetstatFunction reads in every line from the netstat output and lsof output as a String and then appends it to a StringBuilder. When it completes, it invokes toString which throws "OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space." 

After that it would copy the String into a byte array which is then passed to CliUtil.compressBytes. This creates one more giant byte array containing the entire netstat output in compressed form. It's this last byte array which then gets sent to the Locator on a socket.

If the initial toString() doesn't run out of memory, getBytes() or compressBytes() could both push the JVM out of memory as well. I think the fix might require streaming the results back one readLine() at a time instead of trying to build up a giant String and two giant byte[] arrays of the entire output in memory.

GEODE-2488: Remove lsof from netstat command tests

Removed the --with-lsof option from netstat command to reduce the
command response size. Avoids OOME's on JVMs in the test environment
with small heaps.

The original tests with lsof have been retained, but annotated with
@Ignore.

GEODE-2488: Remove test from flaky category

Removed FlakyTest category.
Made note of this JIRA in the @Ignore annoations. This annotation can be
removed when the underlying problem (accumulating large repsonse data on
remote casuing OOME) is fixed.
