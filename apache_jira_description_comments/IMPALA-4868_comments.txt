Seen again in a Jenkins run

Note that this failure started to appear after we upgraded the impala-setup scripts to install Oracle JDK 8 rather than 7. It doesn't seem to fail every time though.

Hm, that's interesting. It's probably worth disabling this test for now because I haven't been able to track down the cause of the failures and this code isn't changing right now, so I don't think it's worth the productivity hit of having a flaky test.

> It's probably worth disabling this test for now

Done.

[~dknupp] does that mean you'll submit the patch to disable :) ? No worries if you don't have time.

Oh shoot! Sorry -- I misread that! I thought you meant disable the job. Oops. In that case, please feel free to submit that patch. :-)

    IMPALA-4868: Disable flaky TestRequestPoolService test

    Disables a test that seemed to get flaky recently, perhaps
    related to testing with Java 8 or maybe even changes in YARN
    (which get used by RequestPoolService).

    Since we're not changing this code right now, let's disable
    this test to unblock builds. Keeping the JIRA open to track
    a better solution.

The test has been disabled. I opened IMPALA-5687 to track re-enabling the test later.
