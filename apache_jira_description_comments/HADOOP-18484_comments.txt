   @pjfanning - `2.7.1` doesnt seem to be there yet. Can you confirm once? Thanks.

   @ashutoshcipher looks like you are right - Github seems to have made this issue public before hsqldb have managed to publish the release to Maven Central.
   
   Maybe, if we wait for a few days and check https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hsqldb/hsqldb/ again.

   Yeah, I will keep the PR open and keep a check on mvn.

   @ashutoshcipher @pjfanning  we may not be able to upgrade to 2.7.0, I tried to upgrade to 2.6.0 some time ago, but found that 2.6.0 and above require JDK 11, do we have a solution for this?




ashutoshcipher commented on PR #4991:

   Thanks @slfan1989. I can here - http://hsqldb.org./ for Version 2.7.0  that 
   
   ```
   Individual jars for Java 6, 8 and 11 are available
   ```




pjfanning commented on PR #4991:

   It seems that you can download jdk8 friendly jars from
   * http://www.hsqldb.org/download/hsqldb_270/ 
   * https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hsqldb/hsqldb/2.7.0/
   
   I'm not a maven expert but I think you might be able to specify a 'classifier' - in this case, possibly 'jdk8' in order to have maven download hsqldb-2.7.0-jdk8.jar.
   
   Presumably v2.7.1.jar will be similar (whenever it gets published).

   Looks like the hsqldb do not want to do a v2.7.1 release. They want users to set system properties.

   @pjfanning Thank you very much for your feedback. From a personal point of view, we should still wait for v2.7.1. The way of setting properties does not seem to be very good. If we hard-code it, we may need to remove it later.

   Yes, it's quite messy all in all. I'm not sure why they won't do a release.

   Thanks @pjfanning @slfan1989 . I think we can wait for a while for 2.7.1 release and take a call if we want to make changes in code or not

   @ashutoshcipher @pjfanning Version 2.7.1 is now available.  May I ask you to update the PR?
   
   > you might be able to specify a 'classifier' - in this case, possibly 'jdk8' in order to have maven download hsqldb-2.7.0-jdk8.jar.
   
   Yes, `<classifier>jdk8</classifier>` is needed for `hsqldb` dependency in all affected POMs.

   The only failing Yetus check is `test4tests`, as there are no new tests.  Existing tests have passed.  I have checked out the change and verified the dependency tree locally: it has the new `org.hsqldb:hsqldb:jar:jdk8:2.7.1` everywhere, e.g.:
   
   ```
   [INFO] org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-mapreduce:pom:3.4.0-SNAPSHOT
   [INFO] \- org.hsqldb:hsqldb:jar:jdk8:2.7.1:compile
   ```

Thanks [~pj.fanning] for reporting this, [~groot] for the patch for trunk.  Please apply to other branches as needed.

Thanks [~adoroszlai] for merging it to trunk. I will raise PRs for other branches as well. Thanks

   `asflicense` warning about `jobTokenPassword` seems wrong, it's an artifact of test runs.  Exclusion was added as part of HADOOP-17125 (https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2297#issuecomment-703789784).
   
   The only test failure seems unrelated.  Cannot delete file during post-test cleanup because the file does not exists:

   The 4 failed tests passed locally (twice) and had no issue with the same patch on either branch-3.2 or trunk, so I assume they are flaky.

   This PR should be okay to merge as the failures doesnt look related.

   @ashutoshcipher I have already approved, and the same change is already in few other branches.  Since `branch-3.3.5` is nearing release (IUC), I wanted to give @steveloughran the chance to take a look.

   Thanks @adoroszlai for triggering build. We have a Happy Yetus now :)

Thanks [~adoroszlai]. Thanks for reviewing the PRs. Can you make the Jira as *fixed* instead of {*}Done{*}?

bq. Can you make the Jira as fixed instead of Done?

Sure, if you prefer.  The resolution I usually use depends on issue type: Bug -> Fixed, Task -> Done, Improvement -> Implemented (but here I felt this is more of a task than an improvement...).

Thanks [~adoroszlai] for sharing the info/details. I think it makes sense what you mentioned :)

   Hello,
   
   Any ideas on when `branch-3.3.5` will be released and where I can subscribe to get notified when it is? 
   Thank you.

   on the hadoop dev list. once mukund gets gpg working *and* we get a couple of blockers in, i'd like to get an RC0 out this month -which is the time to get testing.
