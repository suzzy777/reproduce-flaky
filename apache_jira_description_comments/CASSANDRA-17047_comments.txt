The patch ensure that even when a node is not aware of a {{DROP}} column it will answer correctly to the query by taking into account only the {{fetched}} columns requested by the coordinatoor.


[~samt], [~bdeggleston] Would you have some time for the review?  

Is not this somehow dealt with in CEP-21 by any chance, [~samt] ?

[~smiklosovic] yes, replicas can detect and repair schema mismatches on the query path

So that means that this patch is eligible to be merged only up to 4.1 included, I guess.

Not really. Until the CEP-21 stuff actually lands we shouldn't act as though it has IMO. So if this patch is ok to merge now, then we should probably do so (I don't have cycles to review at the moment though sorry).

Got it. It would be great if [~blerer] refreshed this work and rebased things etc ... 

I will.

[~blerer] can we complete this?

I can take over if you're busy [~blerer]

I will refresh the work and push new patches today.

thanks

I rebased the patches, simplified the tests, added new ones and addressed the review comments.

Reviewed as when I offered to take over I had already started reviewing. Dropped some minor comments. If my eyes aren't fooling me the test hasn't been repeated to test for flakiness. Otherwise lgtm.
