Â 
The patch introduces a non-blocking mode for CDC. When in the mode, no mutation is blocked on full. Instead, the oldest commit logs are removed in order to make space for the new one. The new config name is {{{}cdc_block_writes{}}}, which defaults to {{true}} in order to maintain the existing behavior. It can be set via yaml config or JMX update.

Thanks [~jmckenzie] for the review. I pushed new commits to address the comments. 

Had one other nit / question / thought, but otherwise LGTM. +1
