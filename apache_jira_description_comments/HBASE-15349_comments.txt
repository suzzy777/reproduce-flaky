Resolving HBASE-14722 in favor of this one.

I just pushed this to master branch [~appy]  Only way to test this change is by running with it. I'll leave issue open. When I tried to go to the new surefire over in HBASE-14722, it messed up tests. Hopefully 2.19.1 is better. I'll keep an eye on it.

Em, why won't our vanilla testing work here? Something with Yetus?
Cool, I'll keep an eye too.

Last test failure is because patch failed with "can't find file to patch". Maybe that's why you said that it can only be tested by committing it.

Seems good. We are running more tests now since this patch went in (smile). I'd worry if we were doing less. Thanks [~appy]

[~stack], by any chance the recent test timeouts related to this ? I am not sure, just asking.

[~ashish singhi] I don't think so but could back this out to see if makes a difference if you think it related at all.... just to try it.

We don't seem to get the timeouts when we build trunk, just when we do hadoopqa. That would seem to rule this change out as issue?

No please. I have limited knowledge in maven. I cannot think of a reason where this could be an issue.

Reopening. Let me revert to see if this has anything to do w/ the timeouts we are seeing frequently on hadoopqa.

Pushed to master. Lets see if this related at all [~ashish singhi]

HBASE-15349 Update surefire version to 2.19.1; Trying a REVERT to see if (stack: rev 64204b96c18137de1e71dab04ad2df7f0f7db1c0)
* pom.xml


After this revert I saw few good QA runs where earlier tests were consistently getting timeout.
Thanks.

[~ashish singhi] Me too. My patches stopped timing out. I think you are on to something... Thanks for the suggestion. ... I don't see a 2.19.2.... Maybe we should wait.  Lets gather more evidence this the culprit. It is looking that way.
