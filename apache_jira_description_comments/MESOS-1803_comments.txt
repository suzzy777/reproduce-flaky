The log timings here look as if the threads were starved of CPU:

The logging time stamp is determined at the beginning of the LOG(INFO) expression, when the initial LogMessage object is created. The interleaving of times looks to be a stall of the VM or thread starvation:

{noformat}
22:59:02.136267 21047 // Thread 1, 1st LogMessage flushed.
22:59:02.136276 21049 // Thread 2, 2nd LogMessage flushed.
22:59:14.265326 21049 // Thread 2, 5th LogMessage flushed.
