   From the build failures in the JIRA, it looks like the test occasionally hits request timeout when running from Jenkins (I was able to recreate only with much smaller request timeouts). Since the test blocks requests threads while sending the ACL update requests, updated the test to tolerate timeouts and retry the request for that case. Added an additional check to verify that the requests threads are unblocked when the semaphore is released, ensuring that the timeout is not due to blocked threads.
