I believe it is a somewhat recent error, I looked at common posccommit test errors ~2 months ago and I didn't see this one before.
[~ibzib] [~mxm] Would you happen to know what may have caused the error or who can help triage this? Thanks.

[~tvalentyn] the job in the description has been deleted, can you link a new one?

We may be able to fix this by simply increasing akka.ask.timeout https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/deployment/config.html#rpc--akka
