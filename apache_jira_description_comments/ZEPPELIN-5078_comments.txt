The workaround is to cancel the current running paragraph, and then the remaining paragraphs will be skipped. 

It seems that canceling the current paragraph is disabled on the frontend while whole note is running.

Also, runAllParagraph seems to block the websocket thread, which means that cancel requests are not handled while paragraphs are running. I have a pull request coming up, though I need to get [https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3933] merged first. :)
