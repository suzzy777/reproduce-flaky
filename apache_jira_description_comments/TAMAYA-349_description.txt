When JDK 11 is released, it will be the new LTS platform, so it is important that Tamaya can be built with JDK11. I can confirm that Tamaya 0.3-incubating currently *runs* fine on JDK 11, but there appear to be some minor issues with the maven javadoc plugin that prevent it from building properly on JDK 11. The JaCoCo plugin version could also be updated to 0.8.2, which supports JDK 11.
