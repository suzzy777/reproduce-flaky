During system tests, we occasionally see flaky failures of upgrade_test.py. 

Here is one such recent failure on the 3.3 branch:

{code}
Module: kafkatest.tests.core.upgrade_test
Class:  TestUpgrade
Method: test_upgrade
Arguments:
{
  "compression_types": [
    "none"
  ],
  "from_kafka_version": "0.9.0.1",
  "to_message_format_version": "0.9.0.1"
}
{code}

{code}
AssertionError("2 acked message did not make it to the Consumer. They are: [21017, 21014]. We validated that the first 2 of these missing messages correctly made it into Kafka's data files. This suggests they were lost on their way to the consumer.")
{code}

It would be good to try and reproduce these types of failures and see how we can make the test more robust.
