I grabbed your attached zip (thanks for that!) and I was able to reproduce the issue. However, once I upgrade to 2.5.0 (the reproducer uses 2.3.0 by default) and inserted this line after you start the broker in {{org.apache.camel.component.jms.artemis.ArtemisJmsTestHelper#createConnectionFactory(int, boolean)}} I wasn't able to reproduce the issue anymore:
{code:java}
broker.getActiveMQServer().waitForActivation(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
{code}
My hunch is that you were hitting a race condition with the embedded broker where the client was using the broker before it was fully activated.

Hi [~jbertram], a race condition with broker activation dose fit the behaviour we experienced; 
thanks for now, let me try your fix with the whole test suit and I'll let you know how it goes.

Hi [~jbertram], finally had the time to implement your suggestions and run the whole test suite.

Something has definitely improved: less flaky tests overall usually 1 or 2 per run but still the flaky one are random; suggesting there still might be some race condition issue going on?

On top of that I have 2 permanently failing test that I'll investigate, probably some difference between 2.30.0 and 2.5.0.

I can't reproduce the original issue.  If the original problem still exists or there are other problems I would need some way to reproduce the problem before I could investigate further.
