In the case that the leader tablet server is up but "frozen", the client will get a connection negotiation timeout trying to establish an RPC connection. It appears that this Status::TimeOut() is treated as a non-retriable error by WriteRpc::AnalyzeResponse, so the client gets a failure even if there has been a leader re-election within the client-provided deadline.
