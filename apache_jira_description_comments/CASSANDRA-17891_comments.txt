[~stefan.miklosovic], this test failure keeps on popping up as noticed on CASSANDRA-17144 so I opened a new ticket for you to take a look at it. (You mentioned there you will do it). Thanks 

It was hit on [this run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/285/workflows/600dcc96-5d47-48ab-bc24-e4617decff1f/jobs/2291/tests], and it can also be [reproduced on the multiplexer|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2086/workflows/b8d1b02e-dd9e-452d-8fa5-f65e7208e200/jobs/20954] with this config:
{noformat}
.circleci/generate.sh -m \
  -e REPEATED_DTEST_COUNT=500 \
  -e REPEATED_DTEST_NAME=hintedhandoff_test.py::TestHintedHandoff::test_hintedhandoff_window
{noformat}


I am aware of that. Will take a look in couple days.

Thanks :) 

I think I fixed it. I did 2 runs on 500 repeats without a failure.

Does the sleep need to be such a long time?  It seems like it could be shorter since we are looping.

I tweaked the code a little (PR is same).

I did 3x 500 and all passed
