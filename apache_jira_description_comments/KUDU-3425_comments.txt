KUDU-3425 fix flakiness in TestSnapshotScanBeforeAHM

This patch fixes the flakiness in the TestSnapshotScanBeforeAHM scenario
of the TabletHistoryGcITest test.  The root cause was in
IsAlterTableDone() RPC reporting 'all is done' prior the tablet replica
that served the scan request has received the update on the custom
config for the scanned table.

Setting replication factor to 1 from default 3 made the scenario stable.
