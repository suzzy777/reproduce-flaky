Update statements create delta folders at the end of the execution. When {{insert overwrite}} followed by {{update}} is executed, it does not get any open txns and ends up caching the {{base}} folder. However, the delta folder which gets created at the end of the statement never makes it to the cache. This creates wrong results.
