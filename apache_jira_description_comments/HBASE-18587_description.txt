As a part of HBASE-18533, the Jenkins report said that TestFileIOEngine failed. I investigated and noticed that there are two cases where this test is flaky:
len = 0 and offset 0; it will fail for https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/master/hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/io/hfile/bucket/FileIOEngine.java#L198 will pass in -1 for offset which is invalid.
len = 0 and i = 13; it will try to specify an offset of the totalCapacity which is not allowed.
 
This patch fixes this test.
