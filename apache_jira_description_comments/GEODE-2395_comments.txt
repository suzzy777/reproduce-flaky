GEODE-2395: add FlakyCategory to intermittently failing test

Remove unnecessary throws clause. Change from throws
Throwable to throws Exception on JUnit methods.


This was refiled as GEODE-2646. This shows how frequently this flaky test fails. The more frequent it fails, the higher the priority for fixing this test. Categorizing it as a FlakyTest is NOT meant to mean it won't get fixed. It should get fixed sooner than later.
