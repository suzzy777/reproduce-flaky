We had a few issues with the test stability of Kafka-related tests (FLINK-24119, FLINK-29914). A workaround was to add randomness to topic identifiers. This change required touching multiple code locations that made it obvious that there is some room for improvement (see [Gabor's comment|https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/21247#issuecomment-1307084416] comment in the related PR). We could put some effort into unifying this by providing a common test environment that provides utility methods he mentioned in his comment:

Topic creation
Topic deletion
Random name generation
AdminClient creation
Consumer creation
Producer creation

Currently, we have Kafka instances created in different locations in our test suite (e.g. {{KafkaSourceTestEnv}}, {{KafkaTestEnvironmentImpl}}, {{KafkaTableTestBase}}). One idea is to provide a JUnit5 extension for this similarly to what we do with the [MiniClusterExtension|https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/a6db6ee5d0d6e9b50c6d110793e2efbd0d57cc38/flink-test-utils-parent/flink-test-utils/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/test/junit5/MiniClusterExtension.java] for Flink. Maybe, there's already something out there that can be used/extended.
