The compareTo method of ExtendedNumericComparator does not compare correctly UNDEFINED and NULL.

UNDEFINED should always be smaller than anything but it is not always so when compared with NULL.

compareTo(NULL, UNDEFINED) returns 1, which is correct

but

compareTo(UNDEFINED, NULL) returns 1, and it should return -1.

This could provoke that queries with indexes do not return the right results when these values are involved.
