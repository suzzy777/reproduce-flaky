First patch (Pull request) with metrics recorded in BasicAuthPlugin. No tests so far

Added to the PR
 * More fine grained flow in BasicAuth
 * Initialize metrics only if plugin initialized
 * Test metric counts in BasicAuthIntegrationTest
 * Instrument PKIAuthenticationPlugin with counters
 * Move general timing and number of requets metric to base class
 * Moved auth metric test methods to base SolrCloudTestCase
 * Removed permanent debug logging from BasicAuthStandaloneTest

Question about instrumenting the {{HadoopAuthPlugin}} for reporting metrics [~ichattopadhyaya]

Since the plugin delegates to Hadoop's AuthenticationFilter we don't get a fine grained response to the plugin that we can check for what really happened. I have managed to pull out the response http code and did this metrics mapping
{code:java}
switch (frsp.getStatus()) {
  case HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED:
    // TODO: Cannot tell whether the 401 is due to wrong or missing credentials
    numWrongCredentials.inc();
    break;
    
  case HttpServletResponse.SC_FORBIDDEN:
    // TODO: Are there other status codes which should also translate to error?
    numErrors.mark();
    break;

  default:
    if (frsp.getStatus() >= 200 && frsp.getStatus() <= 299) {
      numAuthenticated.inc();
    } else {
      numErrors.mark();
    }
}
{code}
However when testing with {{TestSolrCloudWithHadoopAuthPlugin}} I get e.g. 4 requests to doAuthenticate, and 2 of these will be status code 200 while the other two are status 401. I suspect the 401 responses to be some kind of challenge/response that end up in the 200 response, but I have not been able to decipher the code fully yet. Any suggestions on how to proceed?

My experimental code is in [https://github.com/cominvent/lucene-solr/tree/solr12791-hadoop-auth-metrics] 

Appreciate any feedback on this approach. Especially from [~ichattopadhyaya] and [~ab]

Hi [~janhoy], I'll be able to get to this only by the coming Monday, 8th October. I'll keep it on the top of my list of things to look at. Sorry for the delay; feel free to proceed if Andrzej gets to it before me. Thanks for your work on this.

Thanks Ishan, appreciate that.

I have commented directly in the PR with some questions I have myself.

I have incorporated some changes based on first review. [~ichattopadhyaya] do you want to add your comments as well?

Unless I get more feedback I'll commit this on Thursday.

I worked a bit to improve the tests, and discovered that when beasting the tests the assertion on metric count gets wrong. We assert the counts by talking to the cluster's Jetty Runners, getting core container and metrics manager from there. So if another test runs in parallel the numbers will be wrong.

With Mark's push towards less flaky tests, I'd like this one to be beast-able :) Here are the alternatives I see:
 * A: Initialize the cluster inside the test method instead of in BeforeClass. Then each test instance will have their own cluster with their own metrics. This works for test classes having only one test method.
 * B: Do not assert any metrics in the various Auth tests. Instead create a new {{TestAuthMetrics}} class with exactly one test method, spinning up a cluster inside the test. Disadvantage is we duplicate much test logic in two places.
 * C: Mock. Spin up Solr with e.g. a {{MockBasicAuthPlugin}} in security.json, which somehow manages to keep metrics per test-method. To be honest I don't see clearly what that would look like..
 * D: Do not expect a certain count for various metrics. Instead do *one* single assert at the end of each auth plugin's integration test where we simply check that all counters that the test is supposed to increment are non-null. That assertion will pass even if another test also increments the same counter in another thread.

So I pushed a change to the [Pull Request|https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/457] implementing option D, just checking that counters has been increased to a certain minimum. Beasted BasicAuthIntegrationTest and it looks promising. 

Got  [Pull Request #457|https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/457] up to date with master. Precommit and tests pass. Beasting {{BasicAuthIntegrationTest}} is ok as long as {{-Dtests.dups}} is <=3, probably due to the stop/start of random Jetty and only having 3 jettys in cluster, and the fact that the way we assert that metric counters is by asking the Jetty's - if they get restarted by another parallell test thread the counters would be cleared and the counts wrong..

Plan to commit current patch to master only on Wednesday.
