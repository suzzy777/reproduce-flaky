Added below on PR: "What versions of hbase do you see this failure in? I wonder why your PR didn't show up on the JIRA? Normally if the commit has the jira as first thing, it attaches to the JIRA. You don't seem to have an account on apache JIRA? Maybe that is it? Mind creating one so we can assign you the issue? Thanks."

I have only tested this on the trunk version (specifically, 5e84997f2ffdbcf5f849d70c30ddbe2db4039ca4).

I believe I do have an account on apache JIRA, as I was able to create this issue. Are there any additional steps I must take to create/setup my account?

Merged. Thanks for the patch [~OrDTesters] I added you as a contributor.

Should this go into other branches? [~stack]

Reopen to backport (thanks for the kick [~Apache9])

Pushed to branch-2.1+ too. Re-resolving.
