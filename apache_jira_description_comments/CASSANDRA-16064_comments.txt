I also feel I should backport this to 3.0.  I started this in 3.0 and found a bug where we don't include the table name's size in our estimate.  We didn't use sizeOf for correctness like we do in 4.0, so less critical.

bq. I should backport this to 3.0

Fair. Either way, I'll try to have feedback on trunk by tomorrow.

Pushed up a round of review notesÂ [https://github.com/jonmeredith/cassandra/pull/new/CASSANDRA-16064-suggestions]

Ok hitting issues with reversed type... working on tests for reversed type and fixing the issues found... this caused the current tests to be flaky; targeting 2pm my time to complete tests.

Ok finally got all tests stable, but had to expand the scope to fix other issues... feel it may make more sense to split this up to isolate the changes; thoughts?

python dtests are passing other than 7 tests which look to be caused by https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/commit/cefddf845d63919c6e7b5efa35b28fe7a5ad1142 changing the Api they call

Do we have a committer lined up? Perhaps [~aleksey], given the minor involvement?

David can commit, heh.

Ouch. Sorry.

Thanks for all the reviews so far.  I have wrapped up everything and running through CI right now.

java8: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra/448/workflows/3982d772-6f37-4ff2-bc16-af1c1613462b

only failing test so far looks to be CASSANDRA-15861, so so far so good.

Caleb and Jon both +1 in PR

CI results: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra/455/workflows/a60aef20-a3e0-4f3a-b055-93e9b040d82a

there were flaky tests and I forgot to merge the python dtest changes in CASSANDRA-7544 so those tests also failed (so pushed the tests).
