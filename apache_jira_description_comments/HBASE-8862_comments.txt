Based on the log, it seems there is some thread scheduling issue. The CheckForSplit thread ran for quite some time while the split thread was waiting so that the split could not finish in time. In the patch, I decreased the CheckForSplit thread a little, moved the split call before starting CheckForSplit thread.  I also added some logging for HBASE-8887.

Go for it Jimmy I'd say -- maybe wait on hadoopqa and then commit.

Copy over description of HBASE-8887. Thanks Ted for reporting it:

From https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/4222/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client/TestAdmin/testForceSplitMultiFamily/,

java.lang.AssertionError
	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:86)
	at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:41)
	at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:52)
	at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestAdmin.splitTest(TestAdmin.java:1044)
	at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestAdmin.testForceSplitMultiFamily(TestAdmin.java:928)

the assertion below failed:

          assertTrue(delta >= deltaForLargestFamily);

I think the assertion above should include delta as well as deltaForLargestFamily
