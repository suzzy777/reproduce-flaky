Saw this again. I agree with Will's assessment, though it's not clear to me whether the fix should be in production code (i.e. maybe the vote request timeout shouldn't be coupled to the failure detection duration, or maybe timed out vote requests should be retried) or in test code. Probably the latter, but just wanted to float an alternative.
