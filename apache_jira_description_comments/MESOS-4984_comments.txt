cc [~arojas] -- this test was added in {{4ed15230}}.

Looks like we were missing a pause/settle. I added a trivial patch to fix this: https://reviews.apache.org/r/45166/ . Added you both as reviewers.

Let me find a shepherd willing to commit this.

    Fixed flaky `MasterTest.SlavesEndpointTwoSlaves`.
    
    We were not correctly waiting for the master to register the first
    slave before making a call to the `/slaves` endpoint. There was this
    possible race:
    
    - Slave1 is started.
    - Slave2 is started.
    - Slave2 sends register message to master.
    - Slave2 re-tries the register message.
    - Master registers slave2.
    - Master resends register acknowledgment to slave2.
    - The test thinks both expectations (`FUTURE_PROTOBUF`) have completed.
    - Test calls `/slaves` and sees only 1 slave has registered. Test fails.
    - Master registers slave1.
    
    Reordering the `AWAIT_READY` calls to explicitly wait for `slave1` to
    register first should fix the flakiness.
