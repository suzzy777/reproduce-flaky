The patch fixes a number of places in {{EmailActionExecutor}}, {{HCatAccessorService}}, and {{SLAEmailEventListener}} that were not using {{ConfigurationService.get}} methods.  It also allows the {{ConfigurationService}} verify method to ignore {{ProxyUserService}} and {{GroupsService}} prefixed configs.  It also adds the missing configs to oozie-default, updates the docs, and fixes a few misc related things.

cancelling and re-submitting the {{patch-available}} for running the jenkins.

1) Connection timeout and socket timeout are different. One is for establishing connection and other is for response. Better to keep two different settings for them. I am fine getting rid of SMTP_TIMEOUT and using EMAIL_SMTP_SOCKET_TIMEOUT_MS instead. But can we add equivalent EmailActionExecutor.EMAIL_CONNECTION_SOCKET_TIMEOUT_MS for SMTP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT and use that in EmailActionExecutor as well for connection timeout.
{code}
-        String smtpConnectTimeout = conf.get(SMTP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, SMTP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT);
-        String smtpTimeout = conf.get(SMTP_TIMEOUT, SMTP_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT);
+        Integer timeoutMillisInt = ConfigurationService.getInt(EmailActionExecutor.EMAIL_SMTP_SOCKET_TIMEOUT_MS);
{code}
2)  String path = ConfigurationService.get(HCAT_CONFIGURATION).trim();
  Not a fan of this idea as it is hacky. Requires adding dummy values to oozie-default.xml when it does not make sense and handling the dummy value in code. I would rather have them included in a separate list like VERIFY_PREFIX_PROPERTIES_TO_IGNORE and be skipped.

Hi,[~asalamon74],Can you help me to review this?Thank  you very much!

[~nobigo] It seems to me you created a brand new patch and entirely dropped the old patch. What was the reasoning behind that?

Hi,I delete entirely the patch Because I named that path is
OOZIE-2338-001.patch. This name should be continue OOZIE-2338-003.patch. So
I delete.

Andras Salamon (JIRA) <jira@apache.org> 于2019年3月5日周二 下午6:45写道：



[~nobigo] I don't really understand your explanation. The last patch from 2016 ( OOZIE-2338.002.patch ) contains lots of code which is missing from your patches ( oozie-2338-003.patch, oozie-2338-004.patch ). What is the reason for that?

Hi,[~asalamon74],I have check the new version about oozie 5.2.0-SNAPSHOT. The configuration about "oozie.emil" had been add by someone in oozie-default.xml. So the warn information about "oozie.email" is not show now. So I upload patch to resolve the log warn about "ProxyUserService" and "GroupsService". Thank you.

Thanks for the explanation [~nobigo]. I now see the reason for omitting some of the previous patch. It seems to me some of the e-mail settings (e.g. {{oozie.email.blacklist.*}} were not added to {{oozie-default.xml}}. Similarly the patch also refers to {{oozie.service.HCatAccessorService.hcat.configuration}}. Could you please check those properties?

Hi,[~asalamon74],Can you help me to review this?Thank  you very much!

[~nobigo] Thanks for the new patch.
 * For {{HCAT_CONFIGURATION}} the solution of the old patch (by [~rkanter]) was to add the property to {{oozie-default.xml}}. Your patch just adds it to the exception list. Why?
 * If we add {{HCAT_CONFIGURATION}} to to exception list: Why do you use {{contains}} for {{HCAT_CONFIGURATION}} checking? Why not {{equals}}?
 * If we need to use {{startsWith}} and {{equals}} (or {{contains}}) at the same time, then I think we should you regexp matches instead.
 * Could you please also check the whitespace formatting. For instance spaces after {{for}}, {{if}}...

My biggest concern is the fact that we may miss a few other properties, I don't really know any foolproof way to list all the properties missing from {{oozie-default.xml}} We have discussed this issue with [~kmarton] and opened OOZIE-3462. I think it might be useful to fix OOZIE-3462 first. That requires to checks lots of code, we might find a few more special properties.
