Currently we send a report per-fragment instance to the coordinator every 5 seconds (by default; modifiable via query option 'status_report_interval').

For queries with a large number of fragment instances, this generates tremendous amounts  of network traffic to the coordinator, which will only be aggravated with higher a DOP.

We should instead queue per-fragment instance reports and send out a per-query report to the coordinator instead.
