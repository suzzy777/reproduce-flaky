updateAccessTime is affecting the statistics on the src table.

Sorry for stealing this [~vihangk1], I just saw that you assigned this to yourself. If you don't agree with the patch or if you have a version of your own feel free to drop it.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12860634 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build

The {{comments.q}} is successful as expected. {{testTransportFailure}} has been failing for several runs {{drop_with_concurrency.q}} is passing locally, I think it is not related based on the error.

I checked this with:
{code}
mvn install -Pitests -Dtest=TestCliDriver -Dqfile=updateAccessTime.q,comments.q -DskipSparkTests
{code}
and it failed with this issue...It seemed to me that {{QTestUtil#clearTestSideEffects}} have tried to restore the original value.

I think this might be something possibly serious...
{{QTestUtil#clearTestSideEffects}} should have been able to clear out {{hive.exec.pre.hooks}} to the default; but seems like it wasn't able to...it might be some loose {{HiveConf}} instance buried somewhere - which may cause more troubles in the future, since it doesn't necessarily belong to the current session...my current guess is that it will be inside the explain logic somewhere...


No worries [~zsombor.klara] I didn't know you were actively working on this. Please assign the JIRA to yourself when you are planning to work on it so that we don't step on each other's toes :) Reassigning this you .. btw I didn't get into the details but if statistics diff is a problem, shouldn't we find a way to ignore statistics diffs for qtests? Having different statistics has been a known issue for flakiness in general.

I think the side effect in this case cannot be cleared. The problem is that the {{UpdateInputAccessTimeHook}} is performing an alter on the {{src}} table which in turn is invalidating the statistics. The hooks need to be reset not because {{QTestUtil#clearTestSideEffects}} will not reset them, but because we need to reanalyse the table and {{EnforceReadOnlyTables}} is preventing us from doing so.

[~zsombor.klara] well...I didin't see that coming! :)
I see now how the patch fixes this the problem...I think it would be ok to copy the src table prior to enabling this extra hook - that way you don't need to disable the readonly hook - and would possibly be able to protect the src table from future "changes"...but anyway the patch looks good in its current form as well so +1 :)
...this qtest framework really needs some rework

pushed to master. Thank you [~zsombor.klara] for fixing this test!

[~zsombor.klara] can this be merged to branch-2? It's failing there too

[~stakiar]
Patch uploaded for branch-2.3.

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
