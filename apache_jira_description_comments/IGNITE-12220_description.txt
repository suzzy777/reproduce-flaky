Currently, {{CACHE_CREATE}} and {{CACHE_DESTROY}} permissions are enforced to be system-level permissions, see for instance {{SecurityPermissionSetBuilder#appendCachePermissions}}. This looks inflexible: Ignite Security implementations are not able to manage cache creation and deletion permissions on per-cache basis (unlike get/put/remove permissions). All such limitations should be found and removed in order to allow all {{CACHE_*}} permissions to be set both at system and per-cache levels.
