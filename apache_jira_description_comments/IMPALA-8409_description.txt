STRING columns without avg_size statistic are calculated into the row-size as 11 bytes, while they take 12 bytes in the tuple (+ more somewhere in  the memory if they are not empty). The issue is caused by adding -1 (meaning unknown) to the 12 byte slot size.

I think that this doesn't cause problems, as the estimation is probably way off without statistics anyway, but row-size >= tuple size seems like a meaningful invariant that we shouldn't break.

Reproduce:
{code}
create table test_row_size (s string);
explain select * from test_row_size; 
Result:
...
WARNING: The following tables are missing relevant table and/or column statistics.
default.test_row_size
