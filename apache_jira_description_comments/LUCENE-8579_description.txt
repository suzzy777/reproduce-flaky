Nick pinged me because his attempt to build a release failed because of Solr test failures. When looking at those, I noticed that a number of them were known flaky test that are already tagged as bad apples, eg. org.apache.solr.cloud.TestStressInPlaceUpdates.stressTest.

We should disable badapples in the script to build a release, ie. something like

{code:python}
diff --git a/dev-tools/scripts/buildAndPushRelease.py b/dev-tools/scripts/buildAndPushRelease.py
index 5a8f5cc..b557da2 100644
