Seeing how this feature was added to 4.0, we should not release with this bug; so marked it for beta.

Its possible the defaults for the cluster are set to false, so absence of --blocking would be non-blocking, but in the cases where the configs are true and you  should still be able to mark non-blocking.

patch LGTM, running CI now https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra?branch=review%2FCASSANDRA-15819

CI didn't pass but looks like known flaky tests and an intermediate issue with circle ci and docker images.  

LGTM +1.

Need another review as well.

Right, I didn't run CI as I saw only a minimal NodeTool test. But thx for running it, better safe than sorry :-)

+1 Thanks for the patch.
