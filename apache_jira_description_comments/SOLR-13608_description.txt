SIP-12 lays out a plan for adding support for incremental backups to Solr.  At a high level, the idea is that Solr will be able to store multiple backups in the same location, and backups beyond the first one will only upload those files that were not uploaded by previous backups.

This involves changes to the file structure within a particular backup location.  It also entails changes to some of the backup/restore API parameters and semantics, to accommodate storing multiple backups in the same place, etc.

This ticket covers the changes required for this functionality, as described in SIP-12 unless mentioned specifically below.  It does not implement all of [SIP-12.|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SOLR/SIP-12%3A+Incremental+Backup+and+Restore]  Same-collection-restoration, support for popular proprietary blob stores, etc. are left for separate tickets in an attempt to keep PRs manageable and conceptually cohesive.
