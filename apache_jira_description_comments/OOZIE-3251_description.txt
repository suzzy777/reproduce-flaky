After fixing a couple of tests related to JMS, we still see problems with {{testConnectionDrop}}. Although ActiveMQ connections and individual {{BrokerService}} instances seem to be closed properly everywhere, this issue keeps coming up in our internal environment.

ActiveMQ JMX management beans are unnecessary for testing, therefore we can disable them.
