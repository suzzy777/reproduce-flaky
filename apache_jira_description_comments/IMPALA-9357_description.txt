The EE test {{test_self_events}} seems flaky. In what follows the stacktrace is provided.
{code:java}
Stacktrace

Since this test was recently added by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMPALA-9101 and reviewed by [~stigahuang], maybe you could provide some insight into it? The JIRA is assigned to [~vihangk1] for now, but please feel free to re-assign it to others as appropriate. Thanks!
