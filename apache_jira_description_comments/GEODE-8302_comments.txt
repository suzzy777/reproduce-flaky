   â€¦saction-events is true
   
   Batch conflation is not compatible with group-transaction-events.
   It must be prevented that both are enabled at the same time for
   a given gateway sender.

   When the following diff is applied, the modified test `testPartitionedSerialPropagationHA()` also fails with incorrectly conflated events. Since this test does not set `groupTransactionEvents` to true, it seems like there is more to this issue.

   > @albertogpz Good material - thanks for writing the docs for this feature.
   > I have some edits for clarification and consistency, in both user guide files and the javadoc comments in class files. I will send these to you in email for you to incorporate as you see fit. Thanks!
   
   Thanks for the review, Dave. I have accepted all  your proposals with the exception of the javadoc on ```GatewaySenderQueue.java``` which had not ended up describing correctly the ```peekedIdsWithoutExtra``` member variable. I changed it to a simpler sentence. Let me know if you are ok with the change.

   In the last commit I reverted most of the code added in the second [4ff9b1d](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5313/commits/4ff9b1d236771d80bbf6f613d1e13b131519743d) and just added a simpler fix.
   The comment from @davebarnes97 about the javadoc in ```GatewaySenderQueue.java``` would not apply anymore as that javadoc would not change.

   Thanks for the comments, Dave.
   Changes done on the erb file and on four java files. I hope you meant four files counting with CreateGatewaySenderCommand.java. I could not find the string in a fifth file.

   It appears that the failing StressNewTest seen in this PR is caused by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-8320 and has not been introduced by these changes, so with a clean pre-checkin, this should be okay to merge.

   I'd rather have this PR merged first because fixing the flaky test case will probably take longer and I plan to do it on top of this solution.

   Hi Alberto, I would suggest splitting up the commit for GEODE-8320 fix separate from GEODE-8302.
   You can still work on multiple commits for GEODE-8320
   - This helps to maintain clear records in the release notes for releases.
   - In case we have to revert the fix for GEODE-8320 we don't have to also revert the fix for GEODE-8302 and vice versa,

   Hi Naba. What you are proposing makes a lot of sense. Nevertheless, in this case, I do not know if it is worth it as the solution for both tickets is shared, i.e., the solution for GEODE-8320 is a subset of the solution for GEODE-8302.
   If I split the solution into two PRs I would have to repeat the solution on both PRs, have it reviewed twice, do changes if needed on both...
   Do you still think I should do it like that or could we just have the PR for GEODE-8302 solve both GEODE-8302  and GEODE-8320?

   @nabarunnag I agree that is not recommended to include more than one ticket solution in the same commit, but in this case one ticket is a subset of the other one. Luckily Alberto has solved the bigger one, that as a side effect solves the other. Or even you can think that it is invalidating the other one, as it cannot be reproduced after merging GEODE-8302.
   
   Anyway independently of the decision taken, GEODE-8302 can be merged into develop if there is no other problem with the review. Then Alberto could prepare a separate PR with the code of GEODE-8320 that will result on an empty commit in develop because the code is already there.

   @DonalEvans Could you please review my latest commit? It was targeted at fixing a failing test case that was actually not the same as the one in GEODE-8320 but this last commit fixes the problem in both test cases.

GEODE-8302: Fixed 'events not queued conflated' stats when group-tranâ€¦ (#5313)

* GEODE-8302: Fixed 'events not queued conflated' stats when group-transaction-events is true

It must be prevented that both are enabled at the same time for
a given gateway sender.

* GEODE-8302: Add extra checks in propagation with HA tests and add fix in conflation stats

* GEODE-8302: Update GatewaySenderFactory javadoc

Added information about incompatibility between
group-transaction-events and enable-batch-conflation.
