Not particularly sure when it started whether it is a test setup issue or a bug, when the test was setup it always passes. I'll try to take a look when I have free cycles.

This issue is assigned but has not received an update in 30 days so it has been labeled "stale-assigned". If you are still working on the issue, please give an update and remove the label. If you are no longer working on the issue, please unassign so someone else may work on it. In 7 days the issue will be automatically unassigned.

This issue was marked "stale-assigned" and has not received a public comment in 7 days. It is now automatically unassigned. If you are still working on it, you can assign it to yourself again. Please also give an update about the status of the work.

This issue is P2 but has been unassigned without any comment for 60 days so it has been labeled "stale-P2". If this issue is still affecting you, we care! Please comment and remove the label. Otherwise, in 14 days the issue will be moved to P3.

Please see https://beam.apache.org/contribute/jira-priorities/ for a detailed explanation of what these priorities mean.


This issue was marked "stale-P2" and has not received a public comment in 14 days. It is now automatically moved to P3. If you are still affected by it, you can comment and move it back to P2.

This is no longer flaky, it's just failing now: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_python_mongoio_load_test/

It looks like it's been perma-red for a while, there aren't any passing runs on ci-beam.apache.org. Could you take a look [~yichi]?

Is this resolved?

You can see current status here: [https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_python_mongoio_load_test/]

It looks like it's ok. I see one instance of the "Missing required option: region." failure though: [https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_python_mongoio_load_test/3401/]

It would be good to look into that further and see if it's a flake that we can resolve, there may be higher priority flakes though, if it is a flake it's pretty infrequent right now.

I think the region is added in this PR. [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17284.]

Got it, thanks. Note [https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_python_mongoio_load_test/3401/] ran on April 20, after that PR was merged (April 5). I'm still in favor of closing this though, we can re-open if it re-occurs.
