[~twmarshall] I think we might have fixed this between IMPALA-6742 and IMPALA-341. IMPALA-341 fixed that query lifecycle bug with status reports. IMPALA-6742 should mean that profiles fetched before query unregistration have the summary added in. Am I missing something? 

Yeah, agreed that the issues here have been addressed now
