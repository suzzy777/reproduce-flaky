I've just saw that we seem to have some new flaky tests...these "partition_wise_fileformatXX" tests started failing 

in the recent builds going back from https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/22006/
in almost all of them there were at least one partition_wise_fileformatXX test failing...
(I've gone back ~5 builds)
