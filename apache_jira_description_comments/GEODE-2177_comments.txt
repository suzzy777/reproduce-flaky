This appears to be a flaky test, but I'm not sure if our build will allow FlakyTest category on a test in geode-examples.

In testing this appears to be caused by too low a timeout of the watchdog on the script execute. Increasing the timeout from 60 seconds to 120 or 180 appears to address this in my testing.

In part we think this test is failing because of timing differences in the test environment caused by virtualization.

GEODE-2177: Increase timeout for examples tests

- This seems to only be surfacing in CI builds which run in a
  virtualized environment.
