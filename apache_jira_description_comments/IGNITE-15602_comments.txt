I have a code fix for this issue that I would like to contribute to Ignite. It's really simple. :)

Hi, Raymond! Thanks for this ticket.

 

But I don't see the KubernetesConnectionConfiguration.DiscoveryPort property you mentioned. I'd like to see your PR, please let me know when you submit it. Thanks!

Apologies, I wrote the original text from the wrong viewpoint, I have amended it.

Hi, Raymond. I put a very minor comment about code formatting. As it's a public class the docs within a class should be formatted the same way.

Exclude this, PR looks good. Additional thanks [~ptupitsyn] for explaination me the issue in private.

[~rpwilson] looks good to me in general, please see a few formatting suggestions on GitHub.

[~timonin.maksim] /[~ptupitsyn]: Thanks for the reviews and comments/suggestions.

I see there is a 'Close pull request' button, but I assume that requires a committer to action.

[~rpwilson] thank you, I'll merge the PR once teamcity passes (I've restarted some failed tests just to make sure).

Thanks for the contribution [~rpwilson]!

You're welcome :)

I have marked this as fixed in 2.12 as this is the next release train I think. Is this sufficient for it to be included in the 2.12 release?

Yes, this should be sufficient.
