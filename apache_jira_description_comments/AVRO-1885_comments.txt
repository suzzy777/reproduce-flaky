added things currently targeting 1.8.2 that are critical, blocker, or have a patch available.

In the interest of getting the RC out, I propose we remove AVRO-1811 and AVRO-1843 from the list of blockers. AVRO-1811 has a patch, but it isn't complete yet and this has been a bug for a long time without being caught so I think the priority is pretty low. AVRO-1843 is also low priority and is close but doesn't need to hold up the release. If they make it in time, that's great but I don't think they need to be blockers. Anyone else have an opinion?

I think the remaining 3 issues (excluding AVRO-1811 and AVRO-1843) are ready to be committed and just need final reviews. Then we should be ready for an RC since AVRO-1900 fixes the build blocker.

[~rdblue] AVRO-1900 was not a blocker for 1.8.X.
It was a problem i saw with master.
The issue [~busbey] saw in 1.8.X was AVRO-1887

I don't think you mean AVRO-1887. Is there a different one?

Yes I mean AVRO-1897.
Sorry about that.

I would like to see AVRO-1913 be part of this. But it's not really a blocker.

I reviewed the two PRs you posted. They look good to me, thanks for taking the time to fix those.

[~rdblue] Please check how you rate this one: AVRO-1916

I would really like to have this one fixed.

[~busbey], are we close to a release candidate? I don't think any of the linked issues are actually blockers:

* AVRO-1897 has a work-around and is minor
* AVRO-1856 is a new feature that would be nice, but isn't a blocker
* AVRO-1932 is also nice to have, but not a blocker

[~rdblue] Can you please have a quick look at AVRO-1924 . 
To me this seems like a backwards compatibility problem that slipped into 1.8.1. 
How fixable is this?

AVRO-1885: Update CHANGES.txt for 1.8.2 release.


assigning to Ryan since there's an RC up now.

thanks Ryan! I'll schedule time to vote on this RC. If it doesn't pass for some reason, happy to take on the next one.

AVRO-1966 (NPE in the use of generated Builders) got fixed just now. 
Please include this one in the 1.8.2. release as well. 
Thanks.

A second NPE caught and fixed that I would like in 1.8.2 aswell: AVRO-1967

It probably makes sense to include AVRO-1965 in 1.8.2 too.  This is a namespace bug when parsing schemas.

I agree, we'll get those in the next RC.

Another that would be nice to get in: AVRO-1957

Any chance this could include AVRO-1658 ? There's a patch available and it would make Avro a nice "tool" to document schemas across teams. 

Is there a target date for 1.8.2 ? It looks like last activity was 3 months ago.

[~pgirolami] AVRO-1658 is failing the tests.

If no one has any issues, I will go ahead and work on a RC for branch 1.8 with the last commit has as : {{bd457af368e4de281607835e196e78800278b94e}}

Any chance of including the following Ruby issues?
  AVRO-1695 - opened Aug 23, 2016
  AVRO-1969 - opened Dec 17, 2016

I would like to add following JIRAs these are reviewed and tested but needs a committer vote 

AVRO-2003 https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/201
AVRO-1931 https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/199
AVRO-1933 https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/200



Just now I ran into an obscure problem in the 1.8.2 release I thought I had already fixed.
Researching the issue I found that some of the fixes that have been committed to the master over the last few months have not been included in this release.

I myself made some of those fixes and I would really like to know:  What went wrong? What did I do wrong?

To get some insight I simply did a diff of the CHANGELOG and found these to be missing:
AVRO-1993: C++ Byte ordering macro does not work on FreeBSD (thiru)
AVRO-1975: Upgrade java dependencies (gabor)
AVRO-1960: Add log4j properties for avro-tools
AVRO-1748. Add Snappy Compression to C++ DataFile (J. Langley via thiru)
AVRO-1626: C#: Fix Avro.pref build error. (Naruto Takahashi via blue)
AVRO-1966: Java: Fix NPE When copying builder with nullable record. (Niels Basjes)
AVRO-1967: Java: Fix NPE when calling getXyzBuilder on instance where the xyz is null (Niels Basjes)
AVRO-1970: Java: Flaky test: TestInputBytes. (Gabor Szadovszky via tomwhite)
AVRO-1881: Java: Avro (Java) Memory Leak when reusing JsonDecoder instance. (Nandor Kollar via tomwhite)
AVRO-1954: Java: Schema.Field.defaultVal() generates: Unknown datum type (Nandor Kollar via tomwhite)
AVRO-1930: JsonParser doesn't handle integer scientific notation (Pietro Cerutti via thiru)
AVRO-1912: C++ Resolving Decoding doesn't work if element removed from record in array. (via thiru)
AVRO-1866. JsonNullFormatter fwd-declared as class, defined as struct ( Pietro Cerutti via thiru)
AVRO-1750. GenericDatum API behavior breaking change (thiru)
AVRO-1995: JSON Parser does not properly check current state (Victor Mota via thiru)
AVRO-1216. Setting precision for the output stream (John McClean via thiru)
AVRO-1937: C++ generator for recursive structure crashes (thiru)
AVRO-1892. C++ library cannot parse unions with default values (Hua Zhang via thiru)
AVRO-1994. C++ Code Generator Generates Invalid Code if Field is of type Null (Darryl Green via thiru)
AVRO-1997. Avro Field.defaultVal broken for Fixed fields. (Zoltan Farkasi via thiru)
AVRO-1838: Java: Update checkstyle to catch trailing whitespace. (nielsbasjes via blue)

Since several of these are NPE/crashes area I think we should consider getting 1.8.3 out quicker than what we would normally do.


Master is targetting 1.9.0 now, if the committer of the fix doesn't cherry pick back to branch 1.8 or branch 1.7 before closing then those things won't get into new 1.8 or 1.7 releases.

branch-1.8 broke off of master in December 2015, so for example AVRO-1966 looks like it was committed only to master but the fix version was set to 1.8.2 instead of 1.9.0.

I have some release process notes I use in Apache HBase to check how well JIRA and git mesh up with each other, we could try making use of some of them if anyone is interested in making use of it.

The release has been completed successfully.
