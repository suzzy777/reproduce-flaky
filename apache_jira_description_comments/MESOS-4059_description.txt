Per comments in MESOS-3916, the fix for that issue decreased the degree of flakiness, but it seems that some intermittent test failures do occur -- should be investigated.

This is a race between [launching and acknowledging two tasks|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/75aaaacb89fa961b249c9ab7fa0f45dfa9d415a5/src/tests/master_maintenance_tests.cpp#L1486-L1517].  The status updates for each task are not necessarily received in the same order as launching the tasks.
