how do they trash llap cache?

[~sershe]: they run a {{select * from table;}} and the disconnect after reading  a few rows.

Oh. That sounds like a plan!

SetUserFunctions ignores parameter in patch

This doesn't seem to be related to LLAP. This is just an addition to SimpleFetchOptimizer.

I take it you called out "in_file" because it's pretty likely that doing that in parallel wins over doing it in HS2? What about others though? Some string manipulations can be slow. Locate, levenstein distance, a bunch of those combined can just be as bad (and create lots of new objects). 

The metadata queries don't use any builtins anyways, do they?

No, ideally the metadata queries should come with a "LIMIT 0" or "where false".

I'd be happier fixing this in Tableau than in Hive.

Removing fixed version (2.0) from Unresolved JIRA in preparation for the release. Please use target version field instead (if not already set) if you think this should be shipped as part of 2.0

I dont understand either the problem or proposed patch. Queries like {{select *}} don't launch job anyway, which apparently [~gopalv] is trying to optimize for. Patch AFAICT tries to extend optimization for {{select col_list }} queries for which select expressions are deemed inexpensive, which [~hagleitn] seems to suggest is not safe to do. Totally at loss here : ) Suggestions?

Extended SimpleFetchOptimizer to optimize select * queries

With tests.

Is TestHs2Metrics a real failure? Looks like it could be related. Otherwise +1

TestHS2Metrics is a flaky test which also failed in same fashion on build # 6197. Certainly not related to this change.

Pushed to master.
