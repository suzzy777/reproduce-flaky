Bharath, can you please take a look at this asap? Thanks!

Alex, I'm not able to reproduce this on my dev setup, did this fail in any of the recent builds? (The one Skye posted doesn't work). I'm wondering if this is failing due to some other parallel tests (not sure).

[~bharathv], try this one:
http://sandbox.jenkins.cloudera.com/view/Impala/view/Nightly-Builds/job/impala-master-repeated-runs-cdh5/409/

Could very well be that it failed due to concurrent tests.

Looking closer into this, the culprit here is a race between hdfs trash checkpointing and our hdfs_file_exists check. HDFS by default checkpoints the trash data every "fs.trash.checkpoint.interval" minutes and moves the contents at that point to  /user/<user>/.Trash/Current/<timestamp> directory and everytime this checkpoint happens in the middle of test run, it fails. Debugged this by analyzing the namenode log

Looking at the hdfs code, it sets fs.trash.checkpoint.interval = fs.trash.interval if fs.trash.checkpoint.interval = 0 (1). We use a 30 minute trash interval in Impala hdfs configs (2) and everytime these tests run at this 30 minutes mark it fails. A simple fix is to set the trash.interval to a day and thats a decent assumption because the tests don't exceed 4/5 hours mark and we can never hit this condition.

Sounds good, [~bharathv]. Thanks for the detailed explanation.

  IMPALA-2624: Increase fs.trash.interval to 24 hours for test suite

Some of the tests rely on hdfs trash mechanism to be enabled and poll
the paths in the trash directory during test runs. These tests are
failing intermittenly due to a race with the hdfs trash checkpointing
mechanism which moves all the trash contents to another directory.
This checkpointing runs every fs.trash.checkpoint.interval minutes
and defaults to fs.trash.interval (when set to 0). Currently there
seems to be no way to disable this checkpointing. This patch increases
the fs.trash.interval from the current value of 30 minutes to 24 hours
so that the test runs never hit this race condition.

[~alex.behm] Should this go to other branches as well 5.6.x/5.5.x etc.? The original job that failed was on 5.5.x. Just wanted to confirm before sending the fix.

[~jyu@cloudera.com] what do you think about Bharath's last question? I'm generally in favor of backporting test fixes to avoid flakiness when validating changes to them.

Agreed. We should back port it.
