MSCK repair fails when hive.mapred.mode is set to strict
HIVE-13788 modified the way we read up partitions for a table to improve performance. Unfortunately it is using PartitionPruner to load the partitions which in turn is checking hive.mapred.mode.
The previous code did not check hive.mapred.mode.
