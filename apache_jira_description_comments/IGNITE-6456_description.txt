There is currently no way to disable only one client. For example, currently you can't disallow thin JDBC driver connectivity alone, you can only disable the whole {{ClientListenerProcessor}}, which is going to disable ODBC and thin .NET clients as well.

We should add options to disable/enable every single client, supported by the {{ClientListenerProcessor}} separately. For example, we can add flags to the {{ClientConnectorConfiguration}}:
{{allowJdbc}}
{{allowOdbc}}
{{allowClient}}
