HiveServer2 cookie-auth is non-functional and forces authentication to be repeated for the status check loop, row fetch loop and the get logs loop.

The repeated auth in the fetch-loop is a performance issue, but is also causing occasional DoS responses from the remote auth-backend if this is not using local /etc/passwd.

The HTTP-Cookie auth once made functional will behave similarly to the binary protocol, authenticating exactly once per JDBC session and not causing further load on the authentication backend irrespective how many rows are returned from the JDBC request.

This due to the fact that the cookies are not sent out with matching flags for SSL usage.
