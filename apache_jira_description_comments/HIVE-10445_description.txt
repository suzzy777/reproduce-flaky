With dynamic partition insert, user should follow the syntax as specified in: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/DynamicPartitions.

However, this is purely enforced on the user side, and there's no checking in Hive. As result, this could cause unexpected results for user queries, or confusing error messages.

I think we need to display information about which input column is used as DP column.
