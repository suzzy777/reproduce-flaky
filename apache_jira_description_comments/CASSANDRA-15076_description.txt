The new full query logger and the audit logger support logging into binary Chronicle logs. Both create records with a small header to indicate what follows, but the two features have adopted different header formats. Let's align the record header format with this ticket.
 * Both features should use the same header layout. This makes it possible to give more user friendly error messages in the {{fqltool}} and {{auditlogviewr}} commands.
 * The record header should have a distinct {{type}} to indicate the type of record.
 * The record header should have a {{version}} so that the record format can evolve.

Current record header format of the FQL is:
{noformat}
version:0(int16)
type:<type>(text)
{noformat}
where {{<type>}} can be either {{batch}} or {{single-query}}.

Current record header format of the binary audit log is:
{noformat}
type:AuditLog(text)
{noformat}
