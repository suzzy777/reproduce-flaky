Users should have the ability to cancel a query on planning or execution stages.
Firstly we should have API to retrieve the identifier of the query and API to cancel a query by the identifier.

For cancel planning see {{AbstractRelOptPlanner.java:91}}, here {{CancelFlag}} is used to cancel planning loop. We need to pass it into a newly created context and bind its state with {{PlanningContext#queryCancel}} to break possible infinite planning loop. See also {{PlanningContext#unwrap}}
