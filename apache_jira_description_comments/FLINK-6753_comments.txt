I also had this issue once. But it is hard to reproduce. I will update the Janino version, this might help. At least I could not get the error again on my machine.

    [FLINK-6753] [table] Fix flaky SqlITCase due to Janino bug

    I hope this fixes the flaky test. Otherwise we have to ask the Janino guys about this error.

Can you tell me what you did to get this exception? I can do the same action in my side.
