Several qtest files are copying schema or test files to the test directories (such as ${system:test.tmp.dir} and ${hiveconf:hive.metastore.warehouse.dir}), many times without changing the name of the copied file. When the same files is copied by another qtest to the same directory the copy and hence the test fails. This can lead to flaky tests when any two of these qtests gets scheduled to the same batch.

 

In order to avoid these failures, we should make sure the files copied to the test dirs have unique names and we should make sure these files are cleaned up by the same qtest files that copies the file.
