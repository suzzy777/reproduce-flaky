IMPALA-10576: Add refresh authorization to make a test case less flaky

We found that a test case run in test_grant_revoke_with_role() that is
used to verify a requesting user does not possess the necessary
privilege to perform the GRANT operation could fail since the expected
AuthorizationException is not returned after the query. Since the
privilege of GRANT was revoked immediately before this test case, we
suspect the authorization-related metadata has not been updated. To make
this test case less flaky, in this patch we add a REFRESH AUTHORIZATION
after the query that revoked the GRANT privilege from the requesting
user.

Testing:
 - Verified that this patch passes the core tests in an ASAN build.
