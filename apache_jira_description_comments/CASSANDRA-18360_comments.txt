The test failure can be reproduced by running the test method separately, without running the entire test class:
{code}
.circleci/generate.sh -p \
  -e REPEATED_UTESTS_COUNT=500 \
  -e REPEATED_UTESTS=org.apache.cassandra.cql3.validation.operations.AlterTest#testDropListAndAddListWithSameName 
{code}
[Bisection|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra?branch=18360-trunk-bisect] shows that the commit where the test started to fail for the first time is [0bed1967fdd1caeb2bbc38645c2a0cb7e728725c|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/0bed1967fdd1caeb2bbc38645c2a0cb7e728725c]. That commit belongs to CASSANDRA-18125, which seems the ticket where the test failure was introduced.

I just saw it also here:

j8 is no longer supported and this test is trickier to reproduce: it needs to be run with one of the cdc, compression, or oa variants under j11/17 (it probably repros without them, but with a lot more iterations.)  That said, we can see the same results that Andres found except with j11: [failing|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1188/workflows/c0a5e6a0-61b8-4a49-be55-814997c73479/jobs/43470] with the introduction of CASSANDRA-18125 to trunk, [passing|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1186/workflows/d8c44566-79e5-4113-9148-f3c89c457bf2/jobs/43272] on the trunk commit just before, [passing|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1187/workflows/f9e0a483-2777-49d4-a9ee-1c4679e49995/jobs/43362] on the initial commit of 18125 to 4.0 and [passing|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1189/workflows/a082fe22-956b-437d-a21b-803b00ce7a67/jobs/43569] the merge to 4.1. So either something went wrong with the merge to trunk, or there's some other interaction that only occurs there. /cc [~jmeredithco]

Thanks for tagging me, I didn't see this before. I'll add investigating the merge to my task list.

Hit it again here: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1215/workflows/9ac94926-f3b4-4787-b924-798445eb0b48/jobs/46281/tests but without any variants.

It seems it doesn't repro anymore:
- Not with RepeatableRunner in 5.0 or trunk
- Not on circle on either on 5.0 [500|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/1059/workflows/2a14c247-d90e-4b31-a58c-455f21395351/jobs/27942] repeats or trunk [5K|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/1061/workflows/7981875b-5956-4e02-b172-ef26d769046b/jobs/28168] and [500|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/1060/workflows/41f40ff6-3724-4121-b759-8f28edca509d/jobs/28055] repeats.

Either it doesn't repro for me or it is gone. If sbdy could confirm with a rebase I'd propose to close as won't repro until it does and reopen if needed. Wdyt?

Edit: [500|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/1062/workflows/431c84e0-17d2-4c87-b311-bd31299d4b7b/jobs/28281] on the free tier doesn't repro either...

Edit2: Although it failed 4 days ago in [jenkins|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1695/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.cql3.validation.operations/AlterTest/testDropListAndAddListWithSameName_cdc_jdk17/]... :-(

If it failed again in Jenkins, I wouldn't close this ticket.

-I guess we will need to get creative again with those hard-to-reproduce flakies :(  . Let me try something. I will get back to you soon- 

Also, I wouldn't advocate closing this ticket before the merge issue mentioned is checked, as [~jonmeredith] mentioned he would do it. 

[~Bereng] , after rereading again all the comments in the ticket, I think you missed this one:


{quote}it needs to be run with one of the cdc, compression, or oa variants under j11/17 (it probably repros without them, but with a lot more iterations.) 
{quote}
I don't see you running the tests with compression or anything. 

That comment is pretty key - I too could not reproduce without the other variants.

I checked over the merge quickly and didn't see any issues. I'll try to investigate more tomorrow. 

Iiuc it should be able to repro without variants iiuc:

But if it happened again then we can't close it :-(

I've reproduced Andres original runs on CircleCI and agree the merge commit is where the issue is introduced. I tried applying the 4.1 change before the memory tracking improvements in CASSANDRA-17240 and still hit failures with the repeat test, so I don't think there's an interaction there. I'll keep looking.


Again https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/868/workflows/1a65d5e7-c3ea-415f-bf6a-eb7048775d22/jobs/27334/tests and https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1263/workflows/a2f7b83d-ff8e-46a8-b34e-d870891d3435/jobs/50628/tests

No progress on this yet. I'm planning to try and track down further cases of negative memory freed to follow on to CASSANDRA-18125 so we will see if that resolves this. Though I have no explanation other than timing for why that patch caused this flake.

Saw an instance of the cdc variant in the wild: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/instaclustr/cassandra/3368/workflows/8309cbb1-cd5b-4945-b590-329617e44c92/jobs/138919/tests
