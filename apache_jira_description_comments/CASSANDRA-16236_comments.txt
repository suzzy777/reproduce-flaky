Have you found anything on this? I see the logs are now deleted in Circle. 100% stable in ci-cassandra.

I have not, and haven't seen this anywhere since the first time.

Closing this since it has never been seen again and there is nothing actionable.  Please reopen if this recurs.

Taking a search of nightlies.a.o found no failures.

(The test xml for the unit test jobs, like [this|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org//job/Cassandra-trunk-test/jdk=jdk_1.8_latest,label=cassandra/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/test/output/], are not archived (yet) so the slower greps against the full pipeline xml test reports have to done).

I can't repro no mater how much I loop it...

It's not easy to reproduce the problem just running it, but it can be reproduced adding calls to {{Thread.sleep}} before [this call to {{System.currentTimeMillis}}|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/io/sstable/SSTableMetadataTest.java#L97].

The cause of the problem is in [this call to {{assertEquals}}|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/io/sstable/SSTableMetadataTest.java#L102]. Since the compared timestamps and the delta are integers {{Assert.assertEquals(float, float, float)}} is used. The int timestamps are casted to floats and, since they have relatively high values, the loss of precision of the cast can make the comparison to fail. For example, while debugging I have seen a run where the compared timestamps were 1616771139 and 1616771129. They are inside the max allowed delta of ten seconds, but the difference between their float values is higher than that (1616771139f - 1616771129f = 128.0).

[The proposed PR|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/942] just forces the use of {{Assert.assertEquals(double, double, double)}} instead of {{Assert.assertEquals(float, float, float)}}, which should give us enough precision.

That is an excellent catch, thank you for the analysis!  I looked at this patch before you posted it, and didn't catch what the fix was, it's so subtle in reading but clear in the explanation. +1 if CI agrees.

I'm glad you like it :) 

Looking for other similar calls to {{Assert.assertEquals(float, float, float)}} across the codebase, I have found that {{SSTableMetadataTrackingTest}}, which is quite similar to {{SSTableMetadataTest}}, might have the same problem. I have added a similar fix for it in the PR.

I can't find other similar cases, which would be anything calling {{Assert.assertEquals(float, float, float)}} with big integers, greater than 2^24 (16777216) if I'm right.

CI and patch look good to me, thanks [~adelapena], that was a good catch fixing also the other class :) 

Thanks for the reviews. CI looks good to me, the failures don't seem related, especially since the changes are limited to {{SSTableMetadataTest}} and {{SSTableMetadataTrackingTest}} and these tests pass.

Committed to trunk as [9b32b8a4369049aec6e0848d21f524a40d2c93f1|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/9b32b8a4369049aec6e0848d21f524a40d2c93f1].

Nice catch [~adelapena]
