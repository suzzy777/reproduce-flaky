When running {{hadoop fs -du}} on a snapshotted directory (or one of its children), the report includes space consumed by blocks that are only present in the snapshots. This is confusing for end users.

{noformat}
$  hadoop fs -du -h -s /tmp/parent /tmp/parent/*
799.7 M  2.3 G  /tmp/parent
799.7 M  2.3 G  /tmp/parent/sub1

$ hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /tmp/parent snap1
Created snapshot /tmp/parent/.snapshot/snap1

$ hadoop fs -rm -skipTrash /tmp/parent/sub1/*
...

$ hadoop fs -du -h -s /tmp/parent /tmp/parent/*
799.7 M  2.3 G  /tmp/parent
799.7 M  2.3 G  /tmp/parent/sub1

$ hdfs dfs -deleteSnapshot /tmp/parent snap1
$ hadoop fs -du -h -s /tmp/parent /tmp/parent/*
0  0  /tmp/parent
0  0  /tmp/parent/sub1
{noformat}

It would be helpful if we had a flag, say -X, to exclude any snapshot related disk usage in the output
