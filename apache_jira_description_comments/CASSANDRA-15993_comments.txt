Fails also in 3.11 - https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/11/label=cassandra,split=16/testReport/junit/dtest.materialized_views_test/TestMaterializedViews/test_view_metadata_cleanup/

Unfortunately, I can't reproduce it

I tried to repro on lowered RAM and capped CPU at different settings until it started simply not working bc of the low resources. Otherwise I can't manage to repro and it looks pretty solid on [cass-ci|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/294/testReport/dtest-novnode.materialized_views_test/TestMaterializedViews/test_view_metadata_cleanup/history/]. The only failure has a weird log which could be just env noise.

It would be good to keep en eye for new failures of this one otherwise close until it repros imo. My 2cts

I'm not seeing failures in ci-cassandra right now, but I think I have a local setup that produces this failure intermittently. I'm going to look into it.

There are a couple things going on here. 

The main source of timeouts was running all the create views at once:
The view builders run asynchronously in the background. As each new CREATE VIEW is issued, the schema migration causes any in-progress build to stop and restart anew. This causes a snowball of stopping and restarting builds that then makes one of the later DDL statements timeout (they would complete with longer timeouts).

Changing the dtest to simply wait for each build synchronously removes that contention. Although they are built serially, due to avoiding contention there is also no increase in runtime. My test setup that previously failed 1/12 times runs hundreds of times with just this change, and no increased timeout. However, there's another mechanism here that makes me think we should raise the timeouts as well:

It just so happens that [this task|https://github.com/aholmberg/cassandra/blob/c6ef4762eeee78ec783b77faa367e82d9b1ffabc/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/service/CassandraDaemon.java#L406-L414] is scheduled to run at roughly the same as the [drop_keyspace|https://github.com/aholmberg/cassandra-dtest/blob/efc64a670955eaf91533911c7cbbb792fd5add19/materialized_views_test.py#L236] DML is usually running, making another chance for contention as the build tasks are stopped for schema migration. I haven't been able to reproduce, but my theory is that's what's causing the [occasional timeout|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-3.11/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/dtest-novnode.materialized_views_test/TestMaterializedViews/test_view_metadata_cleanup/] observed in 3.11. Rather than try to find timing around that, my suggestion is simply to raise the request timeout for any DDL that happens while views are present in the keyspace.

[patch|https://github.com/aholmberg/cassandra-dtest/commit/efc64a670955eaf91533911c7cbbb792fd5add19]
[ci|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/aholmberg/cassandra?branch=CASSANDRA-15993]

I can't repro but the reasoning sounds solid to me. +1 to the current patch and watch the job a few runs for that elusive 3.11 occasional timeout.

Committed, thanks!
