The timing requirements may be a bit too aggressive with this test. Statistics are updated once per second and the test waits up to one second for the expected value. Depending on the system clock resolution and timing of the scheduled tasks, this may not be enough.

Proposed PR https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak/pull/655 gives the assertion 1.5 seconds to see the expected value.

Merged the PR.
