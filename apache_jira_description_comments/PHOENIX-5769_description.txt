I was recently trying to commit changes to Phoenix for multiple issues and were asked to get clean HadoopQA runs.  However, this took a huge effort as I had to resubmit the same patch multiple times in order to get one "clean".  Looking at the errors the most common one were 3 "Multiple regions on <hostname,regions>" and 3 for apache infra issues (host shutdown), 1 for org.apache.hadoop.hbase.NotServingRegionException, 1 for SnapshotDoesNotExistException.   See builds [https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-PHOENIX-Build/] here from 3540's to 3560's.  In addition I see multiple builds running simultaneously, limiting tests to running on 1 host should be configurable right?

In addition I was recommended by [~yanxinyi] that master was less likely to have issues getting a clean run than 4.x.  FYI [~ckulkarni]
