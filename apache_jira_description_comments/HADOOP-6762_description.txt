If a single process creates two unique fileSystems to the same NN using FileSystem.newInstance(), and one of them issues a close(), the leasechecker thread is interrupted.  This interrupt races with the rpc namenode.renew() and can cause a ClosedByInterruptException.  This closes the underlying channel and the other filesystem, sharing the connection will get errors.
