Currently TestHCatStorer runs as a parameterized test, where it runs the same tests for each storage format but within the same junit test case. This prevents it from being parallelized using ptest where parallelism granularity is at a test case level. Instead of using parameterized tests, it makes sense to create a new test case for each storage format.
