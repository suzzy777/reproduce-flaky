rajinisivaram commented on pull request #6383: KAFKA-8039 - Use MockTime in fast reauth test to avoid transient failures
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6383
 
 
   Test uses 100ms as `connections.max.reauth.ms` and checks that a second reauthentication doesn't occur within this interval. But since the interval is small, we cannot guarantee that the time between the two checks is not higher than the max interval. Change the test to use MockTime so that we can control the time.
