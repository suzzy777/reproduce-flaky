[~bernardo.botella] Thanks a lot for the patches :). Unfortunately, the approach you took for the patches is not the correct one (the C* code base isconfusing). Internally C* does not keep the quotes. It eliminates them on input and add them back when recreating the statements for the DESCRIBE.

I added some information in the *Description* section to help you find the parts of the code that need to be modified.

We changed the way DESCRIBE was working in C* 4.0 and moved it on the server side before that DESCRIBE was implemented at the CQLSH level using the python driver. This bug only affect 4.0, 4.1 and trunk. No need to worry about 3.11 :)

Hey [~blerer] thanks a lot for the directions! Hopefully this will make more sense.

[~yifanc] I just updated the trunk PR with a new unit test covering (hopefully) the missing cases.

[~yifanc] New revision updated.

+1 on the patch to trunk. We will need an additional patch for cassandra-4.1 branch :|

Here are the patches for the 3 branches:

+1 on all the patches.

The entries in changes.txt need to be modified so it reflects the patched is merged up from 4.0 branch. I will modify changes.txt and run CI once again on committing. 

[~blerer] , can you take another look? 

Thanks [~bernardo.botella]. The patch looks good to me. 
[~yifanc] were the new tests checked for flakiness?

Rebased all branches and started the full CI runs. I will run the repeated test for the new tests after those finishes.

[~bernardo.botella], bunch of tests failed. Can you take a look? (See the circle CI links in my comment).

I will try to refresh this work, I will assign this to myself for a while due to the inactivity of the author. 

The problem with tests is that the patch introduces this result of aggregate description, for example it would describe an aggregate like this:
{code:java}
CREATE AGGREGATE cqlshtests_dligxmowmx.aggmax(int)
    SFUNC cqlshtests_dligxmowmx."fmax"
    STYPE int; {code}
This does not work because the the value of SFUNC is in form "keyspace.name" and it does not accept this. There can not be ".". It just expects name of the function.

[https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/antlr/Parser.g#L671]

[https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/antlr/Parser.g#L1567]

So the original author introduced something to CQL but parser was not modified.

I do not know how to fix this. I think we should just leave it out as it was and we should just quote the function name. If we are creating an aggregate on some keyspace, I do not think that SFUNC is going to ever be something else from a function in that keyspace. So the further distinction what keyspace that SFUNC is from does not make a lot of sense.

my PR for trunk is here which builds on top of the original work:

[~smiklosovic] I would just add some function and aggregate to the {{testDescribeRoundtrip}} testcase as a safety net to the problem you raised but otherwise your patch looks good to me.

Thanks, I ll look at that.

[~blerer] would you formally +1 it, please?

+1 on the patch. Thanks you [~smiklosovic] for taking it up and finding the issue with SFUNC/FINALFUNC/etc. 

Sorry, I am late but adding my +1 for the record. Thanks [~smiklosovic]
