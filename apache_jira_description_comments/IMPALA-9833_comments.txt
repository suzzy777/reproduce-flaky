I saw this again too. [~stakiar] could you take a look? Looks like you added the test.

Maybe 30s is not enough in a docker env with many concurrent queries? Then we can set it to be executed serially.

Ack looking into it.

IMPALA-9833: Bump timeout in TestQueryStates.test_error_query_state

Increases the timeout in
query_test.test_observability.TestQueryStates.test_error_query_state
from 30 seconds to 300 seconds.

* Unable to reproduce the issue locally, but looped the test fix for an
  hour with 8 concurrent streams

Closing for now. We can re-open if the issue occurs again.

Saw this issue again in exhaustive test. It took 300 seconds, but still failed.

I also just hit this in our nightlies.  Not sure if it's the same occurrence [~wzhou] noticed:
{noformat}
query_test/test_observability.py:777: in test_error_query_state     lambda: self.client.get_runtime_profile(handle)) common/impala_test_suite.py:1141: in assert_eventually     count, timeout_s, error_msg_str)) E   Timeout: Check failed to return True after 300 tries and 300 seconds
{noformat}

Reopening issue.

Same occurrence [~drorke] noticed.

 

I encountered the issue again. I attached the corresponding console output and the excerpted logs from impalad here. The same files are also attached at IMPALA-10352.

Specifically, according to the attached console output, the test started to execute at 17:58:34 and failed at 18:03:34 (after 300 seconds have passed).

17:58:34 query_test/test_observability.py::TestQueryStates::test_error_query_state
18:03:34 [gw3] FAILED query_test/test_observability.py::TestQueryStates::test_error_query_state
{noformat}
In the corresponding log of impalad, we have the following entry, we found the following entry corresponding to the executed query.
{noformat}
I1122 17:58:34.133029 10914 coordinator.cc:148] a849da33d0fd09b9:eb891b0e00000000] Exec() query_id=a849da33d0fd09b9:eb891b0e00000000 stmt=select * from functional.alltypes limit 10
{noformat}
Using the query id ({{a849da33d0fd09b9:eb891b0e00000000}}), I excerpted the log entries between the time this query was registered and this query was deleted and then attached those log entries.

Let me know if other log files are needed. It looks like I can only find the occurrences of {{a849da33d0fd09b9:eb891b0e00000000}} (the query id) in the log file from which I excerpted those log entries.
