As far as I can tell, the only jars that are not fat by default are storm-kafka-examples, storm-kafka-client-examples and storm-elasticsearch-examples. We can either set the dependencies to compile scope always, or introduce a new Maven profile and property so it is possible to set the scope of storm-client differently from the other dependencies.

Thanks [~Srdo], I merged into master.
Please craft a separate PR when you would want to put this into 1.x version lines as well.
