As noted inÂ CASSANDRA-15582 {{BatchMetricsTest}} should test {{BatchStatement.Type.COUNTER}} to cover all the {{BatchMetrics}}.  Some changes were introduced to make this improvement at:

https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...spmallette:CASSANDRA-15582-trunk-batchmetrics

and the following suggestions were made in review (in addition to the suggestion that a separate JIRA be created for this change) by [~dcapwell]:

* I like the usage of BatchStatement.Type for the tests
* honestly feel quick theories is better than random, but glad you added the seed to all asserts =). Would still be better as a quick theories test since you basically wrote a property anyways!
* https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...spmallette:CASSANDRA-15582-trunk-batchmetrics#diff-8948cec1f9d33f10b15c38de80141548R131 feel you should rename to expectedPartitionsPerLoggedBatch {Count,Logged,Unlogged}
* . pre is what the value is, post is what the value is expected to be (rather than what it is).

I ran the current test in a debugger and see that that is the case (aka current test is wrong).
most of the comments are nit picks, but the last one looks like a test bug to me
