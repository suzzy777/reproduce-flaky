I think the reason for testFailAndSuccess failure is that the test doesn't really complete like the retry didn't release the task count(because the test only wait for hasError becomes true but there still are clean up work) yet so the following put failed to be submitted.

For testThreadCreation, it's due to the reason that work item for one server completes too quickly so the second thread isn't created instead the first thread is reused for the work item of another server. I added one second sleep to simulate work load so that threadpool can trigger one more thread.

Thanks [~nkeywal] for the review! I have integrated the fix into trunk and 0.96 branch as the same test failed intermittently in Apache build as well recently.
