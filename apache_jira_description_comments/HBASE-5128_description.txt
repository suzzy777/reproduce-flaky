The current (0.90.5, 0.92.0rc2) versions of hbck detects most of region consistency and table integrity invariant violations.  However with '-fix' it can only automatically repair region consistency cases having to do with deployment problems.  This updated version should be able to handle all cases (including a new orphan regiondir case).  When complete will likely deprecate the OfflineMetaRepair tool and subsume several open META-hole related issue.

Here's the approach (from the comment of at the top of the new version of the file).
{code}
/**
 * HBaseFsck (hbck) is a tool for checking and repairing region consistency and
 * table integrity.  
 * 
 * Region consistency checks verify that META, region deployment on
 * region servers and the state of data in HDFS (.regioninfo files) all are in
 * accordance. 
 * 
 * Table integrity checks verify that that all possible row keys can resolve to
 * exactly one region of a table.  This means there are no individual degenerate
 * or backwards regions; no holes between regions; and that there no overlapping
 * regions. 
 * 
 * The general repair strategy works in these steps.
 * 1) Repair Table Integrity on HDFS. (merge or fabricate regions)
 * 2) Repair Region Consistency with META and assignments
 * 
 * For table integrity repairs, the tables their region directories are scanned
 * for .regioninfo files.  Each table's integrity is then verified.  If there 
 * are any orphan regions (regions with no .regioninfo files), or holes, new 
 * regions are fabricated.  Backwards regions are sidelined as well as empty
 * degenerate (endkey==startkey) regions.  If there are any overlapping regions,
 * a new region is created and all data is merged into the new region.  
 * 
 * Table integrity repairs deal solely with HDFS and can be done offline -- the
 * hbase region servers or master do not need to be running.  These phase can be
 * use to completely reconstruct the META table in an offline fashion. 
 * 
 * Region consistency requires three conditions -- 1) valid .regioninfo file 
 * present in an hdfs region dir,  2) valid row with .regioninfo data in META,
 * and 3) a region is deployed only at the regionserver that is was assigned to.
 * 
 * Region consistency requires hbck to contact the HBase master and region
 * servers, so the connect() must first be called successfully.  Much of the
 * region consistency information is transient and less risky to repair.
