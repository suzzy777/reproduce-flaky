Sometimes some users do some suspicious actions that could be harmful. It would be helpful if James' admin could monitor user trails to audit the potentially harmful actions.
h2. Step 1: Audit trail implementation

In james-core add a {{AuditTrail}} class allowing to log critical user actions accross the application.

Usage:

```
AuditTrail.entry()
    .username(() -> ...)
    .remoteIp(() -> ...)
    .userAgent(() -> ...)
    .protocol(() -> ...)
    .action(() -> ...)
    .parameters(() -> aMap)
    .log();
```
 
Use SLF4J logger to back this.
h2. Step 2: Use the audit trail where needed
