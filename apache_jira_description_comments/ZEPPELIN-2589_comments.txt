    @qwemicheal Thanks for contribution, could you add unit test for this ?


Github user qwemicheal commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2390
  
    @zjffdu Unit test added.

    @qwemicheal Thanks for the contribution. Can you handle the issues @zjffdu mentioned?


Github user qwemicheal commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2390
  
    @zjffdu Unit test merged and the traceback msg concatenated to one string.  
    
    During CI testing, the third one would fail randomly with the following error:
    
    ParagraphActionsIT.testSingleDynamicFormTextInput:554->AbstractZeppelinIT.waitForParagraph:68->AbstractZeppelinIT.pollingWait:94 Â» Timeout
    
    Sometimes, rerun the test  or just do some minor syntax change can pass the third CI. 
    I have no idea why this would happen. The error message seems to be complaining wait timeout during spark test which had nothing to do with the code I changed. 
    



Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    @qwemicheal Almost LGTM, just a few minor issues. And could also attach the new screenshot after you fix this ?


Github user qwemicheal commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2390
  
    Finally pass the CI. @zjffdu I have updated the screen shot and could you share any light on why CI would fail randomly?


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2390
  
    Thanks @qwemicheal , What is the failed test you see ? If it is not in the livy component, then it is most likely flaky test. 


Github user qwemicheal commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2390
  
    @zjffdu The failure most often happen on the third one of Travis CI , sometimes the second one or ninth one. I have checked the error log multiple times and they all have nothing to do with the Livy code I modified. Most of the time just rerun the failed test can then pass. However, the pass statue won't get updated on PR page so I have to trigger the CI again. Do you have any better way to deal with random failure on CI?

    Thanks @qwemicheal , will merge it if no more comments.
