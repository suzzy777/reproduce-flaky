Impala should support insertion for insert-only ACID tables.

For this we need to allocate a write ID for the target table, and write the data into the base/delta directories.

INSERT operation should create a new delta directory with the allocated write ID.

INSERT OVERWRITE should create a new base directory with the allocated write ID. This new base directory will only contain the data coming from this operation.
