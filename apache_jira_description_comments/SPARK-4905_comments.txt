[~hshreedharan] Can you take a look at this please!! I have been seeing this once in a while. I has seen this when the test sent one message at a time, and to increase the chances of success, i modified the test to send one whole bunch at a time, repeatedly, until all got through or nothing got through. But it still seems to failing. I have no idea why empty string are being send when i trying to send "1", 2", "3", etc. Please take a look.

Taking a look now.

I can't reproduce this - but once Jenkins is back, I will look at the logs to see if there is any info there.

What is the reason behind such a behavior where the number of records received is same as sent, but all the records are empty?


I am not sure. It might have something to do with the encoding/decoding. The events even have the headers, but the body is empty (there is comparison of the headers for each event)

Any insights yet?

Can you please take care of this. This must be fixed before 1.3

Is there a recent instance of failure? I can't reproduce this at all.

I've merged [~hshreedharan]'s PR, so let's see if that fixes this issue.  I'm going to resolve this issue for now, but let's re-open it if we still see flakiness in this test.

Thanks [~joshrosen]!
