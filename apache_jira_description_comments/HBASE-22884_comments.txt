Pushed removal of dev-support/Jenkinsfile on branch-2.0. Lets see if has an effect.

If works, disable HBASE-20952 too.. Then make sure no flakey builds anymore.

you have to remove all of these files to disable all builds for a branch:

* {{dev-support/Jenkinsfile}}
* {{dev-support/Jenkinsfile_GitHub}}
* {{dev-support/flaky-tests/flaky-reporting.Jenkinsfile}}
* {{dev-support/flaky-tests/run-flaky-tests.Jenkinsfile}}

Thanks [~busbey]

Ok. In addendum removed other three files.... Pushed on Master.

Undid build on HBASE-20952 too... See HBASE-22885. Ran 'Scan Multibranch Pipeline Now' too as per [~busbey] suggestion up in HBASE-20952.
