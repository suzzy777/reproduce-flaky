Patch build are now failing most of the time because we are dropping zombies. I confirm we are doing this on non-apache build boxes too.

Left-over zombies consume resources on build boxes (OOME cannot create native threads). Having to do multiple test runs in the hope that we can get a non-zombie-making build or making (arbitrary) rulings that the zombies are 'not related' is a productivity sink. And so on...

This is an umbrella issue for a zombie stomping session that started earlier this week. Will hang sub-issues of this one. Am running builds back-to-back on little cluster to turn out the monsters.
