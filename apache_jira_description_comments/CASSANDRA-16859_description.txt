It is common that network scans happen for some companies, and when these scans happen they will send packets to the Cassandra ports which do not match our protocol; when this happens we fail and increment metrics to show this.  To avoid these scans polluting our metrics, we should allow users to block their own IP subnets from updating these metrics.
