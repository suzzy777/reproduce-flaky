Currently, I set this as a normal flaky test issue instead of `Blocker`.

[~dongjoon] Could you provide your environment. I can't reproduce it.

In my case, it happens on Linux box. I've been trying on Mac, but I couldn't reproduce either yet, [~yumwang] .

I'll reply on RC5 email to get more attentions. But, this is a non-blocker for now.

cc [~asomani] FYI
