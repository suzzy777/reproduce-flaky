Hi [~lidavidm] 

I have a couple of queries that need your help.

1. Please help me on the list of structures that need to expose serialize/deserialize methods? From scanning of cpp/arrow/flight/types.h and Flight.proto, I got: 

Todo list:
 # Action  (done, [as the first step|https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13986]) 
 # ActionType
 # Criteria
 # Result
 # FlightEndpoint
 # FlightPayload  (corresponds to FlightData)

Already have serialize/deserialize
{noformat}
BasicAuth
FlightDescriptor
Ticket
FlightInfo{noformat}
No need to add?
{noformat}
Empty
PutResult
Location       (has Parse and a number of methods like ForGrpcTcp) 
SchemaResult   (has GetSchema and serialized_schema){noformat}
2. And parts, like language bindings or existing use cases, for example, that are related to this change? I checked arrow-flight.*-test, however, I worry if I am missing something.

Sincerely,

Thanks for grabbing this!

Empty, Location, and FlightPayload do not need this (FlightPayload is basically internal)

I think SchemaResult should still have it (the format is slightly different between serialized_schema and what SerializeToString would return, since there's the Protobuf metadata). The same goes for PutResult.

Thank you David. Final list:
{code:java}
Action
ActionType
Criteria
FlightEndpoint
PutResult *
Result
SchemaResult {code}
One more query, for PutResult, is it FlightClient::DoPutResult in arrow/flight/client.h?

Sincerely,

I guess PutResult is never exposed directly so don't worry about it then
