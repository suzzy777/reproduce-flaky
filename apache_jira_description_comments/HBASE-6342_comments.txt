I've gotten this setup with the older 0.90/0.92/0.94 builds.  I haven't tested the excludes portion with the newer post-modularization trunk build yet.

Some questions:
* Where do the flaky test lists go? (in repo?)
* If we modify the jenkins scripts, should they go in repo as well? (my vote is yes).

 

Thanks for looking at this, Jon.

I think both the flaky test lists and script modifications should go into the repository, as they should be treated as first-class changes if we do this.

Resolving as later a 3-year-old issue. We also have junit doing rerun of flakies identifying them as so in the test console output. Reopen if I have it wrong.
