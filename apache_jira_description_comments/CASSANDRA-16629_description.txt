h3. Overview
As a part of CASSANDRA-16404, I've been working on {{NodeTool}} commands for invalidation of the auth caches. While working on that, I've mentioned that the existing NodeTool unit tests are written in a different manner and reside in wrong packages. I've made the following changes to them:
# moved them to the proper packages (that match original command class)
# unified naming, formatting, imports
# migrated from {{org.assertj}} to {{hamcrest}} for assertions (though it is not smth really required)
# made a general cleanup
