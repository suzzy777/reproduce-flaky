The failure can be easily reproduced with the multiplexer. For example, [this run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/954/workflows/abc53f58-5585-4e85-8c24-822fb03b9d98] with 100 repetitions reproduces the failure 26 times.

The error happens when trying to concurrently shutdown the instances in {{AbstractCluster#close()}}. Any of the two first nodes can get a rejected connection when trying to connect to the third node, which is the one that wasn't able to do the replacement and is kept running.

The test apparentlyÂ [passes|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/959/workflows/6e8c2754-6c44-43a7-8190-8cce5b6ec604] if we shut down the third node before shutting down the other two instances, [this way|https://github.com/adelapena/cassandra/commit/f730853db1cb557676ae46b248030677b895a91f], but I'm not sure about what is interfering with the parallel shutdown.

It seems this is not failing anymore since the last fixes on Java dtest framework:

I'm just closing this.
