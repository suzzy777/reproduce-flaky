I was able to reproduce this issue successfully on my trunk cluster with 100 threads where each thread create, disable and drop its own table.
This issue is possible when one thread is handling the NodeChildrenChanged event in ZKPermissionWatcher and another thread from behind deletes one of the znode which was already retrieved by ZKPermissionWatcher#nodeChildrenChanged. So accessing data of that znode will result in NPE.

Verified the patch manually with same client by running 5 times and then not able to reproduce this.
Please review.

Also this was properly handled in {{ZKSecretWatcher}} with below code
{code}
        byte[] data = n.getData();
        if (data == null || data.length == 0) {
          LOG.debug("Ignoring empty node "+path);
          continue;
        }
{code}
But was missing in {{ZKNamespaceManager}} and {{ZKPermissionWatcher}}.
With this issue I have handled it at a common place.

+1 on the patch, obvious fix

{noformat}
-1 core tests. The patch failed these unit tests:
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.TestReplicationKillSlaveRS
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.TestRegionRebalancing

I observe locally that TestRegionRebalancing can be flaky when started after a test that hasn't (yet) shut down cleanly.
