[~zamsden] haven't looked into this much, but I'm guessing it may be related to IMPALA-5164 so I'm assigning it to you. Feel free to reassign if I'm wrong.

To be clear, the builds that failed have the fix for IMPALA-5164

Well, the fix was designed to catch contention, but we could be stumbling on some other behavior here.  What was the exact build - release or debug?

I linked to the failed builds in the downstream JIRA:
https://jira.cloudera.com/browse/CDH-55066




Let's not link to vendor-specific trackers that aren't accessible to all, please.

[~zamsden] - I've also seen this in a private, debug build (with a lot of my own patches on top, but that shouldn't affect the benchmarking code).

This happened again on a debug build for me.

Merged the following to unblock flaky builds

IMPALA-5467: disable flaky BenchmarkTest to unblock builds

[~zamsden] - Since we disabled the test, will we be able to investigate this further?

I had an improvement for the reliability of this test, I just need to find it...

It's also not clear what real value this test has, but basic sanity suggests that with no contention, copying 16 bytes will be faster than 128.  Maybe these machines are "glitching" in some way - hangs / pauses / swapping - but it's not clear how to find what might have caused that.

Should we remove the test then?

I'm not opposed to it.  I'm bumping down from critical since this is disabled and thus not a build blocker.  It's still a mystery why this fails sporadically, but more likely has something to do with our test infrastructure than the actual test itself.

I did find the patch I have btw, which seems useful.
