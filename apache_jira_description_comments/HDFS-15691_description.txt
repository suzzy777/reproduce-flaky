The test '{{org.apache.hadoop.lib.servlet.TestServerWebApp.getHomeDir'}} is not idempotent and fails if run twice in the same JVM, because it pollutes state shared among tests. It may be good to clean this state pollution so that some other tests do not fail in the future due to the shared state polluted by this test.
