[~stefan.miklosovic] would you mind taking a look?  If you are cool with this patch I can disable the python dtest from running.

One of the reasons I wrote this was that I found the python test to be flaky; the reason was that the shutdown of "replacement" is based off logs and doesn't deterministically trigger the condition its trying to hit; which lead to passing tests on a branch which didn't have the test.  This patch uses byte code rewriting to enforce the condition making it a bit more stable.

Hi [~dcapwell], yes, I will look at it very shortly.

[~dcapwell]Â it looks good! Btw my build failed on Rat because you havent put the license on top of the test class.

Do you think it makes sense to spend some time on trying to "fix" NetworkTopologyStrategy as you commented on it in ClusterUtils? Making it thread safe / not setting stuff via refrection, that might be done under another ticket, that does not block this one to happen.

bq. my build failed on Rat because you havent put the license on top of the test class.

my template never adds it!!! will fix!

I do, but would prefer to put that into a different ticket as it requires a API change then rollout to all 5 branches.  [~ifesdjeen] ill file a ticket and try to talk to you to make sure we are on the same page with those changes.

[~stefan.miklosovic] all tests are passing and included the python dtest change to no longer run the test on trunk; can you review again?
