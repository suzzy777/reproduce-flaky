We have Guava's Service leaking into the LimitedPrivate interface ReplicationEndpoint:
{code}
public interface ReplicationEndpoint extends Service, ReplicationPeerConfigListener
{code}
This required a private patch when I updated Guava for our internal deployments. This is going to be a problem for us for long term maintenance and implenters of pluggable replication endpoints. LP is only less than public by a degree. We shouldn't leak types from third part code into either Public or LP APIs in my opinion. Let's fix.
