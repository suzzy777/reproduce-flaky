YARN-8842 implemented storing and exposing of metrics of custom resources.
FSQueueMetrics should have a similar implementation.
All metrics stored in this class should have their custom resource counterpart.

In a consequence of metrics were not stored for custom resource type, FairSchedulerQueueInfo haven't contained those values therefore the UI v1 could not show them, obviously. 
See that gpu is missing from the value of  "AM Max Resources" on the attached screenshot.

Additionally, the callees of the following methods (in class FairSchedulerQueueInfo) should consider to query values for custom resource types too: 
getMaxAMShareMB
getMaxAMShareVCores
getAMResourceUsageMB
getAMResourceUsageVCores
