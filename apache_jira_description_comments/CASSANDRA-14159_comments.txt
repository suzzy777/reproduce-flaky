The tests {{drop_while_building}} and {{drop_with_stopped_build}} added by CASSANDRA-12245 slows down the view build to ensure it's dropped/stopped while building. After the view is re-created, the new view build may take longer than the maximum allowed time of 50 seconds due to the byteman slowdown, causing the test to fail.

The fix reduces the number of base table rows from 10k to 5k to allow the second view build to complete on time and also waits for the view to start building before stopping or dropping it to make it more deterministic.

Simple cassandra-dtest patch [here|https://github.com/pauloricardomg/cassandra-dtest/commit/79822e7aa176c4611e0ba87d746e1f29a2ee3c1e].

CI looks good, would you mind taking a look [~adelapena] ?

Nice fix, +1
