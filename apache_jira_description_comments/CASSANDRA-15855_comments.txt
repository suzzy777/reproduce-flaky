[~jasonstack] maybe you want to review/commit this one as you've been involved in it. I did run the dtest locally, is it enough? or is there a way to run dtests against CI without a C* branch commit to trigger them

[~Bereng] [here|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/all/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/145/] you have a run of dtests for trunk and your dtest branch. I'd say we don't need to run them for 3.0 or 3.11, given that it's just ignoring a test and AFAIK we don't have a way to run specific dtests. 

[~adelapena] thx for the run that is very kind of you. You made me think the test should run for <4.0 were the implementation for MVs is different. So I amended my commit to instead of skipping always, running it up to 3X and xfail for 4.0. This is much better imo.wdyt?

Sounds good to me.

New dtest runs for the three involved branches:
|| cassandra-3.0 || cassandra-3.11 || trunk ||
|[147|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/all/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/147/]|[148|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/all/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/148/]|[149|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/all/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/149/]|

I think this can be run on CircleCI creating and pushing new branches from 3.0, 3.11 and trunk where the only change is the CircleCI config file, and never merge those branches. I guess it would be possible to remove the unit tests from that file, so CircleCI only runs the dtests, although I have never done it.

Yeah... I guess some circleci acrobatics could have got us there as well. I will next time thx for the suggestion.

I already sent an email to the ML asking for objections on this test skip + commented on the related tickets with no replies. So I guess I only need someone to step up as a reviewer and merge it.

Looks good to me, I'll be happy to commit unless [~jasonstack] has anything to add.

sorry for the delay..

 

iirc, race condition between view builder and view schema propagation exists on 3.0/3.11/4.0..  should we mark flaky on all version? or do you think the test is more stable on 3.0/3.11?

[~jasonstack] it seems pretty stable both on [3.0|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-3.0/38/testReport/dtest-novnode.materialized_views_test/TestMaterializedViews/test_populate_mv_after_insert_wide_rows/history/] and [3.11|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-3.11/47/testReport/dtest.materialized_views_test/TestMaterializedViews/test_populate_mv_after_insert_wide_rows/history/]. Also CASSANDRA-4571 is fixver 4.0 only. A quick diagonal scroll look of the source code looks like they are different between versions. So I think it's reasonable to preserve 3.X runs. Wdyt?

work for me.
