Query hang reported by [~cartershanklin]

Turns out that once an AM has preempted a task on a node for locality, it will not be able to preempt another task on the same node (specifically for local requests)

Manifests as a query hanging. It's possible for a previous query to interfere with a subsequent query since the AM is shared.
