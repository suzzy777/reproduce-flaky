I think there are two separate causes for the failures.

One is that both [{{testDropExpiredSSTables}}|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/ce877cbe2b7c11355b07cac6f1996a9c9006d89f/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/TimeWindowCompactionStrategyTest.java#L258] and [{{testDropOverlappingExpiredSSTables}}|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/ce877cbe2b7c11355b07cac6f1996a9c9006d89f/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/TimeWindowCompactionStrategyTest.java#L306] create an expiring table with a TTL of one second and then they verify the next compaction task, assuming that the TTL hasn't expired yet ([here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/ce877cbe2b7c11355b07cac6f1996a9c9006d89f/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/TimeWindowCompactionStrategyTest.java#L306] and [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/ce877cbe2b7c11355b07cac6f1996a9c9006d89f/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/TimeWindowCompactionStrategyTest.java#L336-L338]). In a slow CI run that check can happen after the TTL of one second has expired, so the assert will fail. The proposed PR [simply uses an TTL of 10 seconds|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1026/commits/1504474dc3453905558766ba44c05802eeb06635], which seems long enough to survive 10K multiplexer runs. It would be ideal to change the test to not be based on sleeps, but I'm afraid that would require some refactoring out of the test, and I'm not sure we want to do that at this point.

The second problem happens when [{{testDropOverlappingExpiredSSTables}}|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/ce877cbe2b7c11355b07cac6f1996a9c9006d89f/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/TimeWindowCompactionStrategyTest.java#L314] creates a sstable with a TTLed row, and a second sstable with another version of the same row without TTL and with and older timestamp. The intention is that the TTLed row should supersede the non-TTLed row. The problem is that the timestamps assigned to each row are based on separated calls to {{System.currentTimeMillis()}}, in such a way that a slow run can produce the opposite ordering of timestamps, so the non-TTLed row supersedes the TTLed one. The proposed solution is making the values of both timestamps based on the same call to {{System.currentTimeMillis()}}, as it's done [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1026/commits/ad602fa02135be6a1a43e6fe4dd87c9915885f66].

The PR also includes some minor cosmetic changes and fixes for typos and IDE warnings, in [this commit|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1026/commits/9d80053e5053f23a3eade9f294dd1fd2436d96c0].

The test has passed 10K multiplexer runs with [j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/515/workflows/e22d1a2f-bdc9-4bbb-a8d0-f2302bf406fd] and [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/515/workflows/2fa6965f-b5f1-4897-b3c0-186a6aa9f530].

Thank you, [~adelapena], the fixes look good to me. Also, thank you for taking care about warnings and formatting. Plus, it was great you split those things in separate commits!
