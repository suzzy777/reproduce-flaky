    HBASE-15965
    - Testing by executing a command will cover the exact path users will trigger, so its better then directly calling library functions in tests. Changing the tests to use @shell.command(:

    Norm change:
    Commands should print the output user would like to see, but in the end, should also return the relevant value. This way:
    - Tests can use returned value to check that functionality works
    - Tests can capture stdout to assert particular kind of output user should see.
    - We do not print the return value in interactive mode and keep the output clean. See Shell.command() function.

    Bugs found due to this change:
    - Uncovered bug in major_compact.rb with this approach. It was calling admin.majorCompact() which doesn't exist but our tests didn't catch it since they directly tested admin.major_comp
    - Enabled TestReplicationShell. If it's bad, flaky infra will take care of it.

FAILURE: Integrated in HBase-Trunk_matrix #1123 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Trunk_matrix/1123/])
HBASE-16111 Truncate preserve shell command is broken (chenheng: rev e05f527991356405ad7186dd48d9d06201695388)
* hbase-shell/src/main/ruby/hbase/admin.rb


Since the patch in HBASE-15965 compiled and passed TestShell, i believe there's no test for truncate_preserve otherwise it would have caught this basic error. :(
Sorry for causing this bug.

Created HBASE-16120
