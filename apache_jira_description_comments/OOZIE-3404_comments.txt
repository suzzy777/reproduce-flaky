By default {{SPARK_HOME}} environment variable is set to the local directory by [SparkActionExecutor|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/SparkActionExecutor.java#L105-L122]. According to the code it appends it to the {{oozie.launcher.mapred.child.env}} (and {{mapred.child.env}}) properties.

You can also modify these properties in the {{<configuration>}} section of the workflow definition without code modification:
{noformat}
<property> 
<name>oozie.launcher.mapred.child.env</name> 
<value>SPARK_HOME=...</value> 
</property> 
{noformat}
You might also need to add the same value to {{oozie.launcher.yarn.app.mapreduce.am.env}} property.

 

I have rechecked this problem and uploaded the patch. Please review it [~asalamon74], [~andras.piros].

Thanks for the contribution so far [~zuston].

A couple of questions and remarks:
 * new unit tests missing
 * are you sure you need exactly these MapReduce settings for all Hadoop versions 2.0+? This means all the Hadoop versions Oozie currently supports as this is in the range [2.6.0, 3.1.1]
 * please provide tested Oozie and Hadoop versions, as well as relevant pieces of the PySpark workflow definition / job properties file / Spark version / PySpark sources. As [~asalamon74] already pointed out, PySpark works under a wide variety of circumstances
 * I don't understand why setting exactly these MapReduce properties would help the PySpark jobs (and only those) to succeed. Can you please explain?
