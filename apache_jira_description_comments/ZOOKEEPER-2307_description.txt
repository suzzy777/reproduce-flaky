This issue occurred in one of our test environment where disk was being changed to read only very frequently.
The the scenario is as follows:
# Configure three node ZooKeeper cluster, lets say nodes are A, B and C
# Start A and B. Both A and B start successfully, quorum is running.
# Start C, because of IO error C fails to update acceptedEpoch file. But C also starts successfully, joins the quorum as follower
# Stop C
# Start C, bellow exception with message "The accepted epoch, 0 is less than the current epoch, 1" is thrown
