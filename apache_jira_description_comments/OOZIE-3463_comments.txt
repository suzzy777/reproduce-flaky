Thanks [~nobigo] for the very quick patch. I'll check it in more details, can you please address the "the patch contains 5 line(s) longer than 132 characters" warning in the meantime?

Thanks [~nobigo] for the patch! Can you please check if google-guava can be removed from some pom files as well. (for example in oozie-examples module it seems that we do not use it, can you please double check that we need it everywhere?)

HI,[~kmarton],I have read the pom  about the problem. Can we first submit this issue, Then resolve this pom problem  in new issue? Because this patch have too many changes. 

[~nobigo] I also think that the pom change should be addressed in this Jira as suggested by [~kmarton]. I think most of the modules are still use Guava, you might need to change only one or two. You can use the {{mvn dependency:analyze}} command to compare the master version and your version. If it shows guava in the {{Unused declared dependencies found}} section after your change then you can remove it from the pom. If you're not sure just write a comment about your findings.

[~asalamon74], Thank you very much. I will try to resolve this.

[~asalamon74],I have use the mvn dependency:analyze command. But in Unused declared dependencies found list have not com.google.guava.

Thank you [~nobigo] for checking it. +1, committed to master

Closing issue; Oozie 5.2.0 is released
