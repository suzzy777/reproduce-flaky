it seems to me that MiniHiveKdc starts with a default port...in case that's the default kdc port - and there are multiple kdc tests are running in parallel - some of them may fail with a bindexception...

however...this doesn't seem to be the case...there are random ports in there...which should be fine

hmm.. it seems that {{MiniHS2#getBaseDir()}} returns the same directory in case of parallel execution.
