This test has always been very heavy, on my machine some tests are pushing 10s or more. This means that we can pretty much expect them to timeout on Travis with only a 30s timeout.

I have started investigating the runtime of this test recently. There are some quick fixes like excluding Hive catalogs from those tests but that doesn't solve the overall problem.

For now, we can massively increase the timeout until we fix it properly. WDYT?

Also happening in my private AZP (MSFT hosted): https://dev.azure.com/rmetzger/Flink/_build/results?buildId=7891&view=logs&j=69332ead-8935-5abf-5b3d-e4280fb1ff4c&t=6855dd6e-a7b0-5fd1-158e-29fc186b16c8

I'm okay with that workaround as long as we mark this ticket a release blocker and really resolve it properly.

I increased the test timeouts master: 008e0afb3c62c059dcdf2c58a43cdd2e2d283512

I don't think we will be able to fix this "properly" . Some tests are inefficient, yes, because they often recompile/optimize SQL queries. But I changed a test to only do the bare minimum and it still takes roughly 8s on my machine. The majority of this time is spent in Calcite, parsing and optimising the query, and then in a mix of Flink and Calcite to translate that into a JobGraph. Unless we speed up those parts or radically refactor this test we won't solve that.

I'll look into it a bit more.

Fixed by increasing timeouts, please re-open if it fails again.

Okay, thanks!

Also see this failure in release-1.10 crone job: https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/678277566/log.txt

So back ported the fix into release-1.10 via: 0e2b520ec60cc11dce210bc38e574a05fa5a7734

It failed unfortunately again: https://api.travis-ci.com/v3/job/323314732/log.txt

The same observation in latest release-1.10 crone job: https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/679144604/log.txt

Now the error message is different, though (no more timeout but incorrect job status):
{code}
15:51:15.970 [ERROR] testBatchQueryCancel[Planner: blink](org.apache.flink.table.client.gateway.local.LocalExecutorITCase)  Time elapsed: 31.938 s  <<< FAILURE!

{code}

[~liyu]  It's a different issue, the test added in FLINK-15669 is flaky by design. I'm reverting the test and re-opening FLINK-15669.

I reverted the broken tests: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-15669?focusedCommentId=17092586&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17092586

Thanks for the analysis and clarification [~aljoscha]
