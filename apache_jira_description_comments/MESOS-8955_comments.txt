Author: Armand Grillet <agrillet@mesosphere.io>

    Broadened check for Autotools Python environment variables.
    
    The checks now also apply if we run configure with disabled Python
    bindings but enabled new CLI. Another check regarding the Python
    version has been kept separated as we will use different Python
    versions for both components in a later commit.

commit 57091affe3380a01d516b03be2700db85c328ede
Author: Armand Grillet agrillet@mesosphere.io

Improved coverage with configure and `PYTHON` or `PYTHON_VERSION` set.

We set `PYTHON` and `PYTHON_VERSION` when configuring the build.
We now cover all possible cases (both variables set, only one, none).
This ensures that both variables are set after being checked.

commit f9bb153f0abbc0e33787002bfd0d4abacb5f8645
Author: Armand Grillet <agrillet@mesosphere.io>
Date:   Wed Jul 4 15:29:37 2018 +0200

    Refactored logic for `PYTHON` and `PYTHON_VERSION` in `configure.ac`.
    
    This will facilitate the introduction of `PYTHON_3` and
    `PYTHON_3_VERSION` to build the CLI in a future commit.

commit bf69856f241590b652485e012580dbbdb5e11674
Author: Armand Grillet <agrillet@mesosphere.io>
Date:   Wed Jul 4 16:06:36 2018 +0200

    Updated configure.ac and Makefile.am to use `$PYTHON` not `python`.
    
    This ensures that we use Python 2 even if the default Python
    installed in the path under `python` is Python 3.
    
    Previously, even when explicitly setting PYTHON_VERSION or PYTHON to a
    version of Python 2.6+, configuration would succeed, but compilation
    would fail. This commit fixes that.

commit 77921200a69564f966917bfc8e07a3d1e3ada196
Author: Armand Grillet <agrillet@mesosphere.io>
Date:   Fri Jul 6 15:52:28 2018 +0200

    Refactored base of Python CLI tests.
    
    This patch mostly adds additional hardening to make sure we error out
    with proper error messages in places where we weren't before.
    
    However, as part of this, we also fixed a bug related to referencing
    counting Master, Agent, and Task objects. Previously, this reference
    count would increased in '__init__()' and decreased in '__del__()'.
    However, this caused problems when limiting the number of agents and
    masters to exactly 1, because we could never guarantee when the python
    garbage collector would kick in to delete objects from previous test
    runs. This manifested itself as flaky test failures. To fix this, we
    now reference count only on explicit counts to 'launch()' and 'kill()'
    instead of in '__init__()' and '__del__()'.

commit da8cac1691cdb04c179e021980fbfd7773347095
Author: Armand Grillet <agrillet@mesosphere.io>
Date:   Mon Jul 16 16:39:35 2018 +0200

    Updated CLI to Python 3.
    
    The build tools are also up to date thus the CLI can still be built
    using Autotools and CMake. No features have been added to the CLI.
    
    Along the way, we have also fixed some linting errors introduced when
    upgrading pylint a few commits ago. They are included in this commit
    instead of separated out because the commit chain would not apply
    cleanly unless they were committed together.
