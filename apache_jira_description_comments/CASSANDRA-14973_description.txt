In http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-12142, weâ€™ve introduced Beta flag for v5 protocol. However, up till now, v5 is in beta both in [Cassandra|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/transport/ProtocolVersion.java#L46] and in [java-driver|https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/3.x/driver-core/src/main/java/com/datastax/driver/core/ProtocolVersion.java#L35]. 

Before the final 4.0 release is cut, we need to bring v5 out of beta and finalise native protocol spec, and start bringing all new changes to v6 protocol, which will be in beta.
