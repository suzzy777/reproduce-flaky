+1. This will be a useful feature to have.

In addition to offline query validation, it will be really useful to have an option that lists the set of privileges missing that are causing a statement/operation to fail.

Initial patch with -
Validation of config property
list permissions for a user
compile a query to validate permissions for a given user

[~shreepadma] thanks for the feedback. The missing privileges that caused failure will indeed a very useful information. will try to add that.

Please post a review board request for the patch whenever its ready to go.

I believe the common args package can generate the usage statement for you. Also in examples I think we should use the long options as they are easier to understand.

[~brocknoland] Thanks for the suggestions, updated the patch to use common arg package interfaces for usage report. will add examples in the ticket.

[~prasadm] Is this the right way to use this tool on a real hadoop cluster:
{noformat}
bin/senty.sh --hive-home /usr/lib/hive --hive-config /etc/hive/conf -h
{noformat}

I get this error:
{noformat}
Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: Error opening job jar: /home/systest/incubator-sentry/lib/sentry-binding-hive-*.jar

But the sentry jars are at /usr/lib/hive/lib

[~sravya] Thanks for trying it out. The patch is only tested with tarball distribution from the build. The script expects sentry.sh is under bin and sentyr-*.jar are under lib of the same directory structure. You might want to test it using the tarball created by the build.

Nice! Prasad, do you mind if I rebase this?

[~prasadm] when you rebase this can you make it so this tool is invoked only when users specify {{--command policy-file-tool}} or similar?

I have work in https://reviews.apache.org/r/18135/diff/#index_header which has a similar script and I have the service startup when {{--command service}} is give on the command line.

Doing this will help us merge these two efforts later.

[~prasadm]: Thanks for working on this. Would you mind posting a review board request? Thanks!

I've noticed those tests are a little flaky.

Committed to trunk! Thank you Prasad!
