[~stefan.miklosovic] mind taking a look?

This test seems pretty [solid|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk-jvm-dtest/464/jdk=jdk_1.8_latest,label=cassandra/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test/NetstatsRepairStreamingTest/testWithCompressionDisabled/history/] and we don't have logs to look into. Closing atm but feel free to reopen if sbdy disagrees.

bq. This test seems pretty solid and we don't have logs to look into. 

Providing similar links that won't expire:
 - [history|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk-jvm-dtest/lastCompletedBuild/jdk=jdk_1.8_latest,label=cassandra/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test/NetstatsRepairStreamingTest/testWithCompressionDisabled/history/] (like [~Bereng]'s link above)

h4. Searching nightlies.a.o
The logs for this test are archived at
{noformat}
https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-trunk-jvm-dtest/jdk=jdk_1.8_latest,label=cassandra/*/build/test/logs/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.NetstatsRepairStreamingTest/
{noformat}
for example https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-trunk-jvm-dtest/jdk=jdk_1.8_latest,label=cassandra/479/build/test/logs/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.NetstatsRepairStreamingTest/

To search in the archives, we can do**…
{code}
# webdav mount https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/ to /Volumes/cassandra
cd /Volumes/cassandra

xzgrep "name=\"NetstatsRepairStreamingTest\"" Cassandra-trunk/*/TESTS-TestSuites.xml.xz
{code}
shows error (for the class) in builds:
- [Cassandra-trunk#83|https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-trunk/83]
- [Cassandra-trunk#108|https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-trunk/108]
- [Cassandra-trunk#117|https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-trunk/117]
- [Cassandra-trunk#153|https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-trunk/153]
- [Cassandra-trunk#161|https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-trunk/161]
- [Cassandra-trunk#166|https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-trunk/166]
- [Cassandra-trunk#171|https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-trunk/171]
- [Cassandra-trunk#195|https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-trunk/195]
- [Cassandra-trunk#216|https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-trunk/216]

From what I have searched the stage jobs to these failures (i.e. Cassandra-trunk-test builds) are older than the archives we have in nightlies. So only the information in the relevant {{TESTS-TestSuites.xml.xz}} (as linked to above) can be used.

Searching each of those builds reveals the same exception stack trace as described in the ticket description.
For example…
{code}
xzgrep -B1 "error message=\"Table does not match" Cassandra-trunk/216/TESTS-TestSuites.xml.xz 
{code}

Summarising from the 154 Cassandra-trunk builds archived in nightlies.a.o there are 9 failures of {{NetstatsRepairStreamingTest.testWithCompressionEnabled}}. That's a flakiness of ~6%, which corresponds to this [history link|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk-jvm-dtest/lastCompletedBuild/jdk=jdk_1.8_latest,label=cassandra/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test/NetstatsRepairStreamingTest/testWithCompressionEnabled/history/].

**) The test xml for the jvm-dtest jobs, like [this|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org//job/Cassandra-trunk-jvm-dtest/jdk=jdk_1.8_latest,label=cassandra/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/test/output/], are not archived (yet) so the slower greps against the full pipeline xml test reports have to done.
