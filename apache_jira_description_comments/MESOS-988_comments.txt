That test is flaky on my OSX machine as well. After looking at the core-dump produced, turns out the reason is boost's random generator which is also mentioned to be using uninitialized values when running valgrind. That valgrind issue however could certainly be a false positive, just thought it was worth mentioning in the context. 

Does boost also cause the problem on your test-environment, could you check the coredump?


Closing this as we haven't seen this in a while.

I can confirm, it also stopped failing for me on OSX - can not tell why or when.
