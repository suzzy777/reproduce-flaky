Zeppelin Version 0.9.0-preview1

{{Elasticsearch version 7.7.0}}

Trying to use elasticsearch in Zeppelin notebook. Index, Get or Delete command successful, but Search and Count command results with error.

 

Insert a document in Elasticsearch with _index_ command, then try to search:

Notebook command:

 search / \{ "query": { "match_all": { } } }

Result message:

 {{> Error : JSONObject["total"] is not a long.}}

 

Same error for _Count_ command.

Postman  search/count request successful.
