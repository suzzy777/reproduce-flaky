It seems that some time zone abbreviations like {{BST}} for British Summer Time silently just do not get accepted correctly by Oozie and the underlying JVM.

It would be great to:
* emphasize in the Coordinator Functional Specification that it's best to only use time zone format {{Continent/City}}, like {{Europe/London}}, or {{America/Los_Angeles}}, instead of other formats like {{PDT}}, {{PST}}, or {{BST}}
* if the timezone is not recognized by Oozie, it's best to emit a {{WARN}} log and suppose {{UTC}} instead of silently ignoring the unknown specified timezone
