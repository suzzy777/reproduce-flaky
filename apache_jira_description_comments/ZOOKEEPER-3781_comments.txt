According to the document, {{snapshot.trust.empty}} should only be used during upgrade. I interpret it as if all zookeepers are on newer version, they should all generate snapshot.

But our instances are not behaving like that, so zk cannot boot without {{snapshot.trust.empty=true}}. This looks like a bug to me.

I used the vanilla zookeeper 3.5.7 and the issue can be reproduced by the commands
{code}
terminal-1 $ ./apache-zookeeper-3.5.7-bin/bin/zkServer.sh start-foreground /path/to/zk1.cfg

terminal-2 $ ./apache-zookeeper-3.5.7-bin/bin/zkServer.sh start-foreground /path/to/zk2.cfg

terminal-3 $ ./apache-zookeeper-3.5.7-bin/bin/zkServer.sh start-foreground /path/to/zk2.cfg
{code}

Facing the same issue when upgrading to 3.5.8 from 3.4.14 utilizing snapshot.trust.empty=true where some zookeeper nodes in the ensemble did not have snapshot files. 

Having successfully starting up with 3.5.8, nodes that did not have snapshot files did not create them and we were not able to start zookeeper without the snapshot.trust.empty=true config. 

Had to delete the data and datalog directories and allow syncing from the ensemble to work around. 

We are also seeing this on versions from 3.5.7 to 3.6.2.

I took at look at when snapshots are written, and it seems to be in these cases:

* The node is starting off an empty database (https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/release-3.6.2/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/server/persistence/FileTxnSnapLog.java#L291)
* If the node is becoming leader (https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/release-3.6.2/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/server/ZooKeeperServer.java#L511)
* If the node is following, received UPTODATE and the protocol is pre ZAB 1.0, which is not happening in 3.5.x+ (https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/release-3.6.2/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Learner.java#L669)
* If the node is following and did not receive DIFF from the leader, i.e. the follower is far behind the leader (https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/release-3.6.2/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Learner.java#L689)
* If the node has received enough transactions (controlled by snapCount) that the periodic snapshot should be written (https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/release-3.6.2/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/server/SyncRequestProcessor.java#L193)

This leads me to believe that there are the following workarounds, unless you want to run with snapshot.trust.empty=true long-term:

* Leave the cluster running with snapshot.trust.empty=true until enough transactions has been written to trigger a snapshot write. The default snapCount is 100.000, but this could be temporarily lowered.
* While leaving a quorum running, shut down the nodes without snapshots and delete their data. When they restart, the leader will send them a snapshot instead of DIFF.

I think it would be nice if this could be fixed in a future Zookeeper version to make migration from 3.4.x easier. Maybe followers could ask for a full snapshot from the leader if snapshot.trust.empty=true, or they could write a snapshot on boot?

Hi, can we backport this to branch-3.5?

this is an important fix, I cherry-picked it to branch-3.5 to be part of the release 3.5.10 I'm working on.

As it was missing also from branch-3.6, I pushed it there too (after running the tests).
