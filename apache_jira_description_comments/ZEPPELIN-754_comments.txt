    Thanks for the patch. Could you also update [zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license/LICENSE#L3](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license/LICENSE#L3) ?

    @mwkang No worries. Thanks for taking care of the license.
    
    I have checked aws-java-sdk-s3:1.10.62 brings no new/changes of transitive dependency.
    Single test failure https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-zeppelin/jobs/118149866 is irrelevant to this pullrequest.
    
    Looks good to me.
