Likely because it belongs to the too long list of flaky tests. A test should not fail randomly. Here is the list, from 2974 to 2598, with a timeouted TestMetaReaderEditor

It happens on hadoop-qa as well:

Looking at the source code, main issues are:
- in testRetrying, some threads are started, but will not be stopped if an assertion fails. As a consequence, the process will not stop
- still in testRetrying, it's not possible to use @Test(timeout=180000), because if this timeout is reached, the thread won't be stopped.

This does not explain why the test fails sometimes, but explain why we have a timeout instead of a clean failure.


I also fixed some stuff that seems unrelated, and I cannot reproduce the error anymore locally after 10 tries. So I will try the patch on hadoop-qa.

The patch includes as well the removal of TestAdmin#testHundredsOfTable because this test takes 2 minutes to execute; but proves nothing on success as there is no check on ressources used.
