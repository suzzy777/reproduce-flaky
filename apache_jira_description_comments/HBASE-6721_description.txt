In multi-tenant deployments of HBase, it is likely that a RegionServer will be serving out regions from a number of different tables owned by various client applications. Being able to group a subset of running RegionServers and assign specific tables to it, provides a client application a level of isolation and resource allocation.

The proposal essentially is to have an AssignmentManager which is aware of RegionServer groups and assigns tables to region servers based on groupings. Load balancing will occur on a per group basis as well. 

This is essentially a simplification of the approach taken in HBASE-4120. See attached document.
