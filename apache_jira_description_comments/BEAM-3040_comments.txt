I am suspecting that use of {{detox}} to parallelize running multiple {{tox}} tests is the root cause of this. This change was made in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3829

Another issue is, cython compiled files are not properly isolated when multiple test targets run in parallel. This can lead to .so file being deleted prematurely. (Earlier discussion: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/cf49c402c1537902aae5ddae7581ca17299c4345c35626199c2c99f7@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E)

I will suggest switching back to {{tox}} to see if it helps with the random timeouts.

    Use tox instead of detox

Yes, Jason and I were discussing this last week. +1 to reverting detox for the time being.

Tests are still timing out (e.g. https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_MavenInstall/208/consoleFull).


The last thing in the above test log is the following:

{code}

{code}

This might be indicative of test being stuck somewhere in that test. Similarly the timeouts from 202 and 203 also terminate with log statements from universal_local_runner_test

When I was chatting with [~robertwb] he also mentioned that the version of pip on the executors was very old and may be causing build time problems. I've opened https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-15195 with Infra, but as can be seen it's over SLO, so they're probably swamped and may not get to it on a timeframe which is useful to us here.

Can we just use their pip to get a virtualenv and put in a recent pip?

Yes we can do the virtualenv thing. Indeed virtualenv comes with its newer pip version. This should be already happening though, since tox will use virtualenv to run tests.

Is 150 min a reasonable timeout for this test suite? 

150 minutes is reasonable. Successful jobs complete under an hour.

FWIW the aforementioned JIRA (INFRA-15195) had some activity recently -- assuming Puppet has run on all the slaves pip should be up to date.
