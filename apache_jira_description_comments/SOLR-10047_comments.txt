Thanks Keith.
* I merged the pull request to latest master to try this out locally and the UninvertingDirectoryReaderMappingPerSegment requires an implementation of IndexReader#getReaderCacheHelper method which was added to IndexReader in LUCENE-7410
* I find the javadocs for UninvertingDirectoryReaderMappingPerSegment a little confusing. I made an attempt to rewrite them to convey the intention and implementation better. Use if you see fit:
{code}
   * If docvalues are enabled or disabled after data has already been indexed for a field, such that
   * only some segments have docvalues, uninverting on the top level reader will cause 
   * IllegalStateException to be thrown when trying to use a field with such mixed data. This is because
   * the {@link IndexSchema#getUninversionMap(IndexReader)} method decides to put a field 
   * into the uninverteding map only if *NO* segment in the index contains docvalues for that field.
   * 
   * Therefore, this class provides a uninverting map per segment such that for any field, 
   * DocValues are used from segments if they exist and uninversion of the field is performed on the rest
   * of the segments.
{code}
* Perhaps we can rename UninvertingDirectoryReaderMappingPerSegment to PerSegmentUninvertingDirectoryReader or UninvertingDirectoryReaderPerSegmentMapping?

The rest of the changes looks good to me.

- updated javadoc
- renamed class to {{UninvertingDirectoryReaderPerSegmentMapping}}
- added IndexReader#getReaderCacheHelper (copied note from UninvertingDirectoryReader)
- removed old now unsued UninvertingDirectoryReader


Hi Keith, the UninvertingReader#wrap method is used in multiple tests so we can't remove it. We should audit the uses and use UninvertingDirectoryReaderPerSegmentMapping.

Shalin, based on your comment I did a bit of an overhaul to the original PR.

Instead of deleting UninvertingReader#wrap I changed the interface from accepting {{Map}} to {{Function<LeafReader,Map>}}. With this change I updated SolrIndexSearcher to use this interface instead of creating a new static class. I also updated all of the places where the original static function {{wrap}} was being used.

If you think updating all of the test to the new interface is too much overkill/not backcompat I can overload the {{UninvertingReader#wrap}} function to accept the original static mapping and delegate to the new impl.

Thanks Keith, I think we need to keep the old wrap function around for backcompat in 6.x but it should be fine to remove it in the master branch. Rest looks good to me.

Shalin, I wasn't sure exactly how you wanted me to submit the diff between 6.x and master.

In this PR:
- [Commit|https://github.com/kelaban/lucene-solr/commit/806f33e092491cc6a2ee292d2934c76171e40dc7] adds new and old interface, and modifies all the tests to use the new interface
- [Commit|https://github.com/kelaban/lucene-solr/commit/c38f4cabc2828ee83b53b931dd829e29a3e1701c] reverts the tests to using the old interface. 

If you want to keep both interfaces as a convenience method and tests unmodified you can squash them all down. Otherwise use HEAD for 6.x (tests not updated) and reset to HEAD^ for master (tests updated). 

I did not write specific tests to explicitly use new/old signature because they all use the new signature under the hood. The test I added in the original commit tests the updated intended behavior.

Thanks Keith. Let's keep both interfaces and the tests unmodified. I'll squash merge your pull request to master and backport to 6x.

Thanks Keith!

I forgot to add the magic line to the commit which auto-closes the PR so you have to do that manually, sorry!

Policeman Jenkins failure reproduces for me [https://jenkins.thetaphi.de/job/Lucene-Solr-master-Linux/19429/]:

When I run the repro line on my Linux box, the actual value was {{1}} instead of the {{2}} though, so at a minimum there's some flakiness here:

{{[junit4]    > Throwable #1: java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<3> but was:<1>}}

Thanks Steve, I am able to reproduce this using this seed. The test commits three documents and relies on them not being merged into a single segment to verify the behavior of this patch works correctly. It seems like with this seed the merge policy is merging these three segments. 

What is the best way to setup this test to assure that no merges occur?

MergePolicy settings are normally randomized by the solr test configs.

If a test is dependent on controlling exact when a merge does/doesn't happen, you'll need to force the mergepolicy using something like {{NoMergePolicyFactory}}

Example from TestInPlaceUpdatesDistrib...

{code}
// we need consistent segments that aren't re-ordered on merge because we're
// asserting inplace updates happen by checking the internal [docid]
systemSetPropertySolrTestsMergePolicyFactory(NoMergePolicyFactory.class.getName());

// HACK: Don't use a RandomMergePolicy, but only use the mergePolicyFactory that we've just set
System.setProperty(SYSTEM_PROPERTY_SOLR_TESTS_USEMERGEPOLICYFACTORY, "true");
System.setProperty(SYSTEM_PROPERTY_SOLR_TESTS_USEMERGEPOLICY, "false");
{code}

(the last two lines are only needed because we're phasing out MergePolicy for MergePolicyFactory)

Re-opening due to test failures. I'll put up a patch with the fix suggested by Hoss.

Thanks Hoss, [~shalin] -- no need, I will take a look at it today.

Thanks Keith but I have already prepared the patch. I'm just waiting for the results of a round of beasting before I commit.

Attached patch moves the new test into its own class so that we can use NoMergePolicy.
