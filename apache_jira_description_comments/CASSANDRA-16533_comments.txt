[~e.dimitrova], thanks for the heads up.
I do not think {{AbstractNetstatsStreaming}} uses CASSANDRA-16057 to capture the nodetool output. It is using {{NodetoolUtils#nodetool()}} that redirects the stdout and stderr from nodetool invocation within the instance. 

The implementation of CASSANDRA-16057 does not use the redirection trick. Instead, it passes dedicated {{PrintStream}} to accept and only the outputs from nodetool command. 

I just started investigating this issue.

One thing that strikes me in {{NodetoolUtils#nodetool()}} is that we are briefly reassigning {{System.out}} and {{System.err}}, see [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/83e1e9e45193322f18f57aa7cc4ad31d9d5a152d/test/distributed/org/apache/cassandra/distributed/util/NodetoolUtils.java#L57-L58].

This is inherently racy. IMO if another thread writes to {{System.out}} or {{System.err}} while the current thread is executing the nodetool command between lines 57 and 67, then the output will be garbled.

[~stefan.miklosovic] do you remember why we need to reassign {{System.out}} and {{System.err}} in {{NodetoolUtils}}? With the changes introduced by [~yifanc] my understanding is that this is not necessary anymore, as we are passing the {{PrintStream}} directly to {{Instance.DTestNodeTool}}. In which case, this could be an easy fix :) .

CASSANDRA-16057 wasn't completed when CASSANDRA-15406 was done, so I think it's going to be a simple one :)

If that's all it takes, then the PR is ready.

CircleCI doesn't love me much (and likewise) but I think I've got the jobs running here:
 * [CircleCI java8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adutra/cassandra/6/workflows/ff748295-a629-473f-8658-a6327ec9023a]
 * [CircleCI java11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adutra/cassandra/6/workflows/5ef9459f-387c-4488-a06c-80f4a06c36ee]

[~adutra] unfortunately that ticket was done before changes of Yifan were introduced  ... 

I think one reason for not doing it differently was need to release new dtest-api which I did not wanted to do because of delays etc and willingness of other people do release it and so we just ended up with this.

EDIT: or after? I am not completely sure ... But definitely that part smells, I was discussing this with Ekaterina privately already.

Yeah in the meanwhile Yifan suggested to refactor {{NodetoolUtils}} and get rid of it. Which I did, and it does seem that we don't need it anymore after 16057.

Thank you all for valuable input and thanks [~adutra] for the patch.

It looks good to me.

I just triggered a CI run [here |https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/511/]

+1 on the patch. 
Thanks for triggering the CI run. 

I just triggered a new CI run [here |https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/527/] as there was some unrelated issue with the test splits in Jenkins which led to more than 600 failures. The issue is already fixed.

CI run has unrelated failures.

Starting preparation for commit

Committed [here |https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/efa25fc8d10bbfcefe14fc6f2a623b6a8b73b5cd], thank you!
