also shows up [in the list for branch-2|https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-2/204/artifact/dashboard.html#job_2] but not as often

{code}master.TestRestartCluster	25.0% (9 / 36)	9 / 0 / 0{code}

also shows up in branch-2.2 but even less frequently failing.

Looks like this has already been fixed by the following jira: HBASE-22196
Newly created tests don't seem to be flaky anymore except the following on branch-2.2:

{noformat}
master.TestClusterRestartFailoverSplitWithoutZk	10.0% (4 / 40)	
master.TestClusterRestartFailover	25.0% (10 / 40)
{noformat}


Fixed inÂ HBASE-22196
