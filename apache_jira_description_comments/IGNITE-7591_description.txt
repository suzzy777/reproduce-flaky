reproduction:

Start multiple pessimistic transactions, changing the same key.Prepare message from backup node must be blocked(GridDhtTxPrepareResponse). Then backup node crashes.

All transactions mustÂ finish and keys must be committed.

But not all keys are committed. Reproducer attached.

Test is flaky.
