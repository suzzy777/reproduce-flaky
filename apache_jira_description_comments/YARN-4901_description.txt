The {{ResourceManager}} rightly assumes that when it starts, it's starting from naught.  The {{MockRM}}, however, violates that assumption.  For example, in {{TestNMReconnect}}, each test method creates a new {{MockRM}} instance.  The {{QueueMetrics.queueMetrics}} field is static, which means that when multiple {{MockRM}} instances are created, the {{QueueMetrics}} bleed over.  Having the MockRM clear the {{QueueMetrics}} when it starts should resolve the issue.  I haven't looked yet at scope to see how hard easy that is to do.
