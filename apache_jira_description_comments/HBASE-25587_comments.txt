Useful addition IMO. If lots of 'Unknown Servers', can be a pain extracting list to feed hbck2.

I seemed to see issues when all SCPs were passed to the Master at once so perhaps trickle in the SCPs (or schedule them all and internally it does the trickling) or figure what issue is around many SCPs at once.

Good one [~psomogyi].

Thanks for the feedback [~stack]!
I haven't seen similar problems when I ran SCP for multiple clusters, although I haven't tested this on rather large clusters. Do you have a Jira with more information?

I have a patch for this ticket, however, when I wanted to create a unit test based on TestHBCKSCP I noticed the test is flaky. It does not reveal in the original test because SCP is successful for unknown and live RegionServers too, but the newly added command does not trigger SCPs for not unknown servers. I'm looking into how to stabilize the test.

Merged to branch-2.2+. Thanks for the review [~wchevreuil].

The hbase-operator-tools change can come once there is an HBase release containing this change.
