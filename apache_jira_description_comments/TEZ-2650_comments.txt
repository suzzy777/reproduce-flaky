The timestamps are already being recorded. Fixed startTimeRequested to track start events coming from source vertices (and not just the start event sent to initial vertices by the dag). Test added.
Added the time stamps to the ats file parser and tested it.
The rest of the ats file parser changes are renames of methods to differentiate time interval and time stamp and make them consistent with their original counterparts in the dag code. This may help prevent inadvertent errors going forward.

[~rajesh.balamohan] review please!

+1. Test failure seems to be the flaky one. 

Thanks for the review. Yes. There is a separate jira tracking it.

Updated patch with some test improvements. Committing in a bit.
