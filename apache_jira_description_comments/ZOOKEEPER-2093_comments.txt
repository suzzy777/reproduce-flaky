The test failed in the QA is org.apache.zookeeper.test.ReconfigTest.testPortChange

This worked on my machine and I note that another recent run also failed (https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/2447/testReport/org.apache.zookeeper.test/ReconfigTest/testPortChange/history/), so I suspect this test is flaky.
