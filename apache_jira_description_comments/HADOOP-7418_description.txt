the parsing of the input path string to identify the uri authority conflicts with the file system paths. For instance the following is a valid path in both the linux file system and the hdfs.

Exception in thread "main" java.net.UnknownHostException: unknown host: user
        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client$Connection.<init>(Client.java:195)
