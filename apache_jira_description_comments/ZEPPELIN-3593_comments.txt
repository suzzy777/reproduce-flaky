    Will zeppelin reindex all notes when zeppelin server is restarted ? If we store it in file system, we should be able to avoid this kind of reindex.

    Yes, agreed at that point. But in case where users add new notes manually,
    we cannot know them. It means we should read all of indexes and match them
    to sync file system and indexes. So I suggest to reduce memory usage at
    first and then think how to increase the performance of indexes later.

    [HOTFIX] Disable some flaky tests

    ### What is this PR for?
    Some tests become failed due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3593 BTW, it looks like a timing issue. I saw some test was passed if I added some debug logs. Thus I think it's better to make them to functional tests as it doesn't have to test under integration tests
