The constructor {{DataFileReader(File, DatumReader)}} does not close the already opened file again when it throws an exception. This leads to a leaked file descriptor and especially to not being able to delete the still open invalid file then (at least on Windows).

This case is important when Avro files may be truncated on write, e.g. due to a hard shutdown, and the application must be able to recover from such a situation on the next restart.

Please see the attached file {{DataFileReaderCloseBug.java}} to reproduce the problem.

I did not find that problem in Jira/mailing lists. Thanks for your help in advance :)
