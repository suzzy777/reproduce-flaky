I saw this fail in a couple CI builds. Passes for me, so I'm marking it Flaky.

The test sets a system property that is picked up in a static-final-boolean in AutoSerializableManager.  If that class has already been initialized it isn't going to honor the system property setting.  There might be other tests doing the same thing.  They all need to be changed to effect the desired behavior in a different way.

GEODE-2011 Client code which clears pdx registry needs synchronization

We clear pdx registry in client when we re-connect to cluster. But
during that time other thread may end up using old registry while other
thread is clearing this. Thus we need to synchronize that. In current
code it happens through listener events and I modified that notification
to synchronize this.


fixed need to remove flaky mark.
