This happens because the following 2 lines:
{noformat}
"-" + WorkflowExecutionArgs.WF_START_TIME.getName(), Long.toString(new Date().getTime()),
            "-" + WorkflowExecutionArgs.WF_END_TIME.getName(), Long.toString(new Date().getTime() + 1000000),
{noformat}

The endTime is computed against currentMillis, rather than the start time. If the currentTime happens to be a few nanoseconds apart across the millisecond boundary, the test will fail.
