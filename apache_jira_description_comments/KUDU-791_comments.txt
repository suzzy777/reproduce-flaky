This is causing some flakiness of alter_table-test's TestReplicatedAlter test case. The issue is that we issue an alter-table and then immediately scan on the leader. However the leader may not have yet committed the altertable.

I tried changing the test to SCAN_AT_SNAPSHOT but that also doesn't work because the ScanSpec creation (evaluation of the client projection) is done before the "wait for snapshot" code path. I'm also not sure the "wait for snapshot" part would correctly wait for an in-flight alter operation.

I'll change the test in the meantime to use an AssertEventually(...) so it's not flaky, and leave a marker back to this bug.

Another semi-related issue is that IsAlterTableInProgress() returns false as soon as _any_ replica has reported the new schema, but perhaps it should wait for a majority?
