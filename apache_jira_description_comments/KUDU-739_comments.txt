Attaching core dump generated in GDB (bzipped)

Looks from the stacks like this is likely a case where we got a crash after an assertion failure. http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/c/1342/ has a patch which fixes a fairly common flakiness in the test that was running here. Closing as cannot repro since we should be able to track this via the flaky dashboard.
