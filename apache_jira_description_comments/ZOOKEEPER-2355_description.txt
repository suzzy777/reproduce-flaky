ZooKeeper ephemeral node is never deleted if follower fail while reading the proposal packet
The scenario is as follows:
# Configure three node ZooKeeper cluster, lets say nodes are A, B and C, start all, assume A is leader, B and C are follower
# Connect to any of the server and create ephemeral node /e1
# Close the session, ephemeral node /e1 will go for deletion
# While receiving delete proposal make Follower B to fail with {{SocketTimeoutException}}. This we need to do to reproduce the scenario otherwise in production environment it happens because of network fault.
# Remove the fault, just check that faulted Follower is now connected with quorum
# Connect to any of the server, create the same ephemeral node /e1, created is success.
# Close the session,  ephemeral node /e1 will go for deletion
# {color:red}/e1 is not deleted from the faulted Follower B, It should have been deleted as it was again created with another session{color}
# {color:green}/e1 is deleted from Leader A and other Follower C{color}
