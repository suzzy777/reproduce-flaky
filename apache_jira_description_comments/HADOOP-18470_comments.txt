Cloned the branch-3.3 weekly test run to https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/hadoop-qbt-branch-3.3.5-java8-linux-x86_64/

* manual trigger
* emails me, mukund, mehakmeet.
* anyone else who wants to be on that list, ping me

its java8 only. java11 is set up for trunk but not branch-3.3 and i don't want to start working on it.

failing test TestDataNodeRollingUpgrade works locally; looks like its a flaky one

Hi,

Is there an estimated date for this release?

Regards.

RC0 is up to play with, RC1 out as soon as we get the final fixes in. for now, grab the rc0 (announced on hadoop-dev list with maven artifacts in asf staging repo) and test as much as you can

   Expands on the comments in cluster config to tell people they shouldn't be running a cluster without a private VLAN in cloud, that Knox is good here, and unsecured clusters without a VLAN are just computation-as-a-service to crypto miners
