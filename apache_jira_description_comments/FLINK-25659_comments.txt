I temporarily disabled the test on master: 8f84515e796ccc3bf28dd9b558adfef669b51106

Can you give a quick update on the progress for this ticket [~twalthr]?

I tried a couple of different runs to reproduce the flakiness but without success. I will shortly reenable the test again and add more debugging information on master.

I enabled this test on master with: e3a30d6577d80ba38131f6b80647e3b91e7acca6

Please let me know once the test fails for the next time. I'm suspecting a class loading issue but looking forward to logs.

Test is disabled again on master with: adc584990e89797e94b62ef3900527ae507848f3
