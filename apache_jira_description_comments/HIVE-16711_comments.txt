[~ngangam] There was no specific issue or usecase which prompted this change. [~spena] pointed out that {{PROPERTY_ID}} wasn't really needed and its not used. Earlier I thought that datanucleus needs it to identify each instance of the row returned from the tableto have a identity type in order to manage the table. But seems like if we change the identity type to application we can do away with the id column and let the application (HMS) decide how to identify each instance of row by changing {{PROPERTY_KEY}} to primary key instead. This doesn't change the usecase or behavior of the thrift API just gets rid of the extra column.

Out of the 5 test failures following 4 have been failing since last many builds.

The 5th one {{columnstats_part_coltype}}  is a known flaky test reported in HIVE-15169

LGTM
+1

Thanks for the explanation [~vihangk1]. The SQL changes in itself look good to me. So +1 for me as well.

Fixed one of the test in TestSchemaTool used for metastore_db_properties
