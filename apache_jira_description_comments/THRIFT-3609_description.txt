Today 6 cpp lib tests use [TestPortFixture.h|https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/1f6e380c5d07686e4cd8c2b172300a1ba7fbd8b9/lib/cpp/test/TestPortFixture.h].  THRIFT-3608 experimented with correcting one of these cases in {{lib/cpp/test/SecurityTest.cpp}}, but a general cleanup should remove all uses of static ports in the cpp tests to improve robustness and open the path to parallel testing - at least in the cpp libs.
