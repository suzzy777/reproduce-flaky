Moved to the next release due to inactivity. Please, feel free to move it back if you will be able to complete the ticket by 2.8 code freeze date, December 2, 2019.


Because the test task is very short, CheckpointRequestListener catches a message about saving a checkpoint, and the #onSessionEnd method after the task is finished, work simultaneously. In one moment task node add sessionId in closedSess map, and the listener finds sessionId in map. Task node removes the key from keymap for this session and removes checkpoint for this key.
{code:java}
closedSess.add(ses.getId());

// If on task node.
if (ses.getJobId() == null) {
    Set<String> keys = keyMap.remove(ses.getId());

    if (keys != null) {
        for (String key : keys)
            getSpi(ses.getCheckpointSpi()).removeCheckpoint(key);
    }
}{code}
Listener removes the key from keymap and removes checkpoint too (even if the key was not in the map).
{code:java}
if (closedSess.contains(sesId)) {
    keyMap.remove(sesId, keys);

    getSpi(req.getCheckpointSpi()).removeCheckpoint(req.getKey());
}{code}
For bugfix need add listener's check for contains key in keymap before removing key. And delete the checkpoint only if the key is found.
{code:java}
if (closedSess.contains(sesId)) {
    if (keyMap.remove(sesId, keys)) 
        getSpi(req.getCheckpointSpi()).removeCheckpoint(req.getKey());
}
{code}
After fixing a new bug appears.

Between create new keySet and add checkpoint key in the listener,
{code:java}
    Set<String> old = keyMap.putIfAbsent(sesId, (CheckpointSet)(keys = new CheckpointSet(ses)));

    if (old != null)
        keys = old;
}
<-------------- here
keys.add(req.getKey());
{code}
task node adds a session in closedSess map, remove empty keySet for session, but not found no one key (because the listener has not added key yet), and don't remove checkpoint.
{code:java}
Set<String> keys = keyMap.remove(ses.getId());

if (keys != null) {
    for (String key : keys){code}
Listener after added key did not find this key in keyMap, and did not remove checkpoint.
{code:java}
if (closedSess.contains(sesId)) {
    if (keyMap.remove(sesId, keys)){code}
