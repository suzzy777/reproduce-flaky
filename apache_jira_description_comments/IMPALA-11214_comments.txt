IMPALA-11214: Impala reloads Iceberg tables per each data file

Due to a bug in IMPALA-11053, Impala reloads the Iceberg table per each
data file. This causes a serious perf regression for table loads.

This patch avoids reloading the Iceberg tables for each data file.

Testing:
 * added exhaustive e2e test

IMPALA-111218: TestIcebergTable.test_table_load_time_for_many_files flaky

In some test runs test_table_load_time_for_many_files failed because
the time limit (3 seconds) was too short. In the failed tests it was
around 4 seconds to execute the DESCRIBE statement.

This patch increases the time limit to 10 seconds when HDFS is used.
This should be long enough to fix the flakiness, but short enough
to catch pathologically long table loads (the one that was fixed by
IMPALA-11214).
