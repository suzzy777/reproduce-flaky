Thanks. At the moment, not only Chicago Taxi is affected, but also every load test running on Flink runner (for example: [https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_LoadTests_Python_ParDo_Flink_Batch/175/)] This is happening since last Flink 1.10 update. I'll take a look at it.

Resolved by [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11193.] The last build was successful: [https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Python_Chicago_Taxi_Flink/80/]
