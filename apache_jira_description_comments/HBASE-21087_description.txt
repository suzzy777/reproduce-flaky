To avoid folks opening duplicate JIRAs when a test shows up as very broken on the flaky dashboard, we should add a way to flag that a jira is open for it.

since the dashboard is read-only, maybe we could add a jira query for a list of issues with some specific label ("flaky dashboard", "untrusted test", etc) and the test name in the subject line?
