delete_table-itest's TestNoDeleteTombstonedTablets test case is a little flaky since 87dcaf34d3. which implemented removal of excess replicas in the master. The test does the following:

{noformat}
A. Find the leader L of tablet T
B. Find a server X that's not the leader L but has a replica of T.
C. Find a server Y that has no replica of T.
D. Add a replica of T to Y (as a VOTER).
E. Remove the replica of T from X.
F. Wait and check that the master doesn't delete the tombstoned replica of T on Y, even after restart.
{noformat}

The problem is that step D makes T over-replicated, so E is racing with the master removing Y. Rarely, the master wins the race and its config change is pending when step E occurs, which causes E to fail because a tablet will only accept one config change at a time.
