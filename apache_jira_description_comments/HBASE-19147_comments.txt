TestNamespacesInstanceResource, TestReplicaWithCluster, TestReplicationAdmin, and TestRegionServerHostname are failing for me locally as of alpha-4 rc0

Thanks [~elserj] I'm starting to go through them...

Looking at TestRegionServerHostname. Give me a shout if you've already fixed some locally, [~stack].

Tried a run on a physical machine.

Total time: 07:52 h

Tests run: 2450, Failures: 53, Errors: 66, Skipped: 36 ... loads of spew here too with tests getting killed. Maybe my host is sick (though that'd make two in this cluster...)

New run. 7.21h. Tests run: 2665, Failures: 24, Errors: 65, Skipped: 42 .. which is a good few more tests than ran above. Nightly says ' Tests run: 2039, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 24, Flakes: 2' for second part (looking at a few ... they are all just over 2k for second part of hbase-server).

7.23h Tests run: 2742, Failures: 31, Errors: 54, Skipped: 44 ... Tests run varies. Nightly time is less, 4h 47min.

Is the goal to also have those currently flagged as flaky pass?

And is it fine if things pass because we reduce concurrency? or do you want these working under duress?

Was thinking flakies should pass and concurrency shouldn't have an effect on how many tests pass or fail. Thats the hope.

[~stack] Just curious. Should we move all issues about the flaky fix to this parent issue? Or this issue is a *caveat* for 2.0 release?

Did you [~chia7712] suggested and added failing tests as subtasks to here.

We got a pass on a nightly for hadoop2. Failed in hadoop3:Â https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-2/

Do we need to go over the tests again to see the ignore ones?

Thanks.

bq. Do we need to go over the tests again to see the ignore ones?

We could. I made one pass flagging tests that no longer made sense in AMv2 context and fixing others. Could do another pass but I think we in pretty good shape after we nail the current failing set (almost there).

Do we want to fix TestAssignmentManagerMetrics? It is stuck when modifying table with a coprocessor jar which does not exist.

Let me have a go at it.... trying to figure the Merge Region failure. Have an idea...

Resolving umbrella issue. Subtasks have been done.

nightly branch-2.0 passed for the first time last night. This means all tests passed running on hadoop2 and then all tests passed again on top of hadoop3. It has been threatening for a while (yesterday two nightlies passed all unit tests but failed because there were some findbugs unresolved).
