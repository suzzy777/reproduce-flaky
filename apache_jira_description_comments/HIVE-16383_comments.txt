[~thejas]/[~sushanth] can someone please review this change? Also added a config property to configure the connection pool size. HikariCP recommends 
{code}
connections = ((core_count * 2) + effective_spindle_count)
{code}

Let me know if you want me to add that in code (this changes default count of 10) or leave this to user :)

Looks like we end up having 2 separate connection pools, one in ObjectStore and one in TxnHandler. 

Regarding the above formula, the core_count and effective_spindle_count should be the numbers for host where the RDBMS is deployed, is that right ?
Also, the recommendation from HikariCp doesn't seem to take into consideration number of application instances. We would need to account for number of metastore hosts and HS2 with embedded metastore instances to arrive at a proper value. For now, I think lets leave this to the user. The default of 10 seems like an OK value.

[~ekoifman] [~gates]
Any thoughts on using the configured connection pool size for DN (used by ObjectStore) for the pool in TxnHandler as well, instead of hard coded value of 10? (Thats what this patch does). Do we expect the same level of concurrent requests as what we would see via ObjectStore ?

being able to set pools size in TxnHandler via config is great but since the 2 moudules use different pools, configuring them using the same prop seems to complicate the calculation of the pool size

[~thejas] Yes. That's correct. I think it makes sense to leave the pool size at the default 10 and not mess with it because of the reasons you had mentioned above. 

Regd. Eugene's comment, since we are directly passing the configs with datanucleus prefix adding separate configs for TxnHandler and ObjectStore will complicate configs. IMHO we can hold on to the current defaults for now and when required we can follow up adding separate configs for each. 

[~prasanth_j]
Are you suggesting keeping it at hardcoded value of 10 for TxnHandler or use the approach in current patch ?


All of these conn pool libs support reading their config from an xml file.  Wouldn't it be better to just 1 prop per pool to point at it's config file?  This way there is no explosion of props

I was suggesting to use the approach in the current patch. I will update the description to mention how this will affect TxnHandler and how this should be configured in the presence of multiple metastore hosts and multiple HS2 embedded metastore. With the attached patch, current behavior is not changed. If required, we can put a separate configs for each or separate xml files (personally I would prefer this to live in HiveConf - our central place for all configs).

+1 
Please verify failed tests if they are known flaky issues.


Ran TestLlapSignerImpl test locally and it passed for me. It also passed in previous test run. All other tests are failing already in master. 
Committed to master. 

Doc note:  This changes the default value and list of possible values for *datanucleus.connectionPoolingType* and adds *datanucleus.connectionPool.maxPoolSize* to HiveConf.java, so the wiki will need to be updated for release 3.0.0.

* [Configuration Properties -- MetaStore | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-MetaStore]
* [Configuration Properties -- MetaStore -- datanucleus.connectionPoolingType | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-datanucleus.connectionPoolingType]

Added a TODOC3.0 label.

Formatting note:  The description of *datanucleus.connectionPool.maxPoolSize* is 6 lines long but will appear on a single line in the generated template file because \n wasn't used for line breaks.  Can this be fixed?

* [AdminManual Configuration -- hive-site.xml and hive-default.xml.template | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AdminManual+Configuration#AdminManualConfiguration-hive-site.xmlandhive-default.xml.template]

Thanks [~leftylev] for docs notes and line break issue. Update the new configs in metastore section of wiki. Also committed the addendum patch containing the line breaks in config description.  

Thanks for the fix, Prasanth.

Doc note addendum:  HIVE-16321 adds *datanucleus.connectionPool.maxPoolSize* to branch-2.3 and branch-2 for releases 2.3.0 and 2.4.0, so it should be documented for 2.3.0 instead of 3.0.0.

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
