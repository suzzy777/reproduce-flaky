After testing phase we investigated that the next sub-modules are broken and should be removed from the release branch 2.8
 * tensorflow (it uses deprecated IGFS and current solution in tf.contrib could n't connect to Ignite now)
 * tensorflow-ml-parser (it has a lot of bugs and doesn't work with tf 2.0)
 * mleap-ml-parser (CVE, Ignite ML couldn't work with metadata)
 * outdated genetic algorithms what are not supported now and are not formatted and refactored for the years (it's not a part of ML historically)

also due to connect with Hadoop, Spark and another libraries it has a few CVE related to the old dependencies in Hadoop libraries

P.S. I suppose all these solutions should be moved to the separate project ignite-ml-extensions for the independent developement
