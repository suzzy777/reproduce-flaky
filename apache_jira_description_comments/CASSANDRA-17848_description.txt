When producing the resource name, it seems to assume that the content in the `[]` is the function's input type, where it could also be part of the function name, as long as it is quoted. Here is an example to reproduce. In cqlsh,

{code:java}
> CREATE FUNCTION test."admin_created_udf[org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.LongType]"(input int) RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT RETURNS int LANGUAGE java AS 'return 42;';

> LIST EXECUTE OF user;
 role  | username | resource                                | permission
-------+----------+-----------------------------------------+------------
 user  |    user  | <function test.admin_created_udf(long)> |    EXECUTE

(1 rows)
{code}

The input should be "int", but in the output, it says "long". 

If the content enclosed by "[]" is not a valid class, the LIST PERMISSION request always fails for the user with "ConfigurationException: Unable to find abstract-type class".

The bug is discovered by Piotr Sarna.
