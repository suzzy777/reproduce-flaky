    ### What is the Jira issue?
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2647
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    1. Change Notebook workspace to private through whether ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_PUBLIC = false or zeppelin.notebook.public = false.
    2. Set default owners through ZEPPELIN_DEFAULT_OWNER = <comma separated username> or zeppelin.notebook.owner = <comma separated username>.
    3. Create notebook.
    4. Check if notebook's owner is set to both default users and the user who create the notebook.

    @bhavintandel I haven't checked this can be merged into the 0.7 branch. But if there is no problem to merge, and we can include this PR in 0.7.3
    
    - even if there's conflict, we can create a separate PR.

    I will close the PR.


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2525
  
    I think so. If we add admin when creating, it would be better. 


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2525
  
    LGTM.


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2525
  
    I think this feature is useful.  That's because admin can't see all notes currently 
    
    - since they not owner even if admin has `admin` role. 
    - so admin needs to ask all notebook creator to set owner admin as well.
    
    IMO, it's quite weird and i think this PR can solve the problem.



Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2525
  
    @yu74n Could you solve the conflict and reply @felixcheung's last comment?
    
    >  but seems like this isn't just default owner/admin for private mode only, but in all cases?


Github user yu74n commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2525
  
    @1ambda thx
    @felixcheung You are right, this feature affects all modes(private and public). I don't understand public mode in detail, is there any problem if we set admin role in public mode? Should I set admin role at NotebookAuthorization.setNewNotePermissions() when a notebook is created?


Github user yu74n commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2525
  
    One more thing. Should we set admin role to notebook owner in public mode? I'm going to change this feature to set admin role to notebook owner, reader and writer in private mode though. 


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2525
  
    Let me check public and private modes and reply as well. Seems that CI constantly fails.

If there are any features to realise that things already, please let me know.

Would this feature be covered by a more generic "admin" feature in ZEPPELIN-2236 ?
[~jongyoul] has suggested the idea in the users list earlier this year.

    Hi, Thanks for rebasing and testing. But this recent PR passed the CI.
    If you don't mind please re-run few times until successful and check the failure reasons? 
    
    If we can verify they are a flaky test, we can merge, but without evidence, we can't do that.

    ok, could you explain how
    > if set blank as zeppelin.notebook.default.owner.username, disable admin role.
    ?
    I think also it'll be good to match template to the default value

    if set blank as default owner username, apply blank('') to the admin role. but, I think, a user cannot set blank as login user name. so nearly equal as disable admin role.

    hmm, since this is around security perhaps we need to be more careful?
    how about we add a check for the owner username is valid (at least not "") and not add to the admin role if it is not valid?

    Actually, I thought so too when I explained how if the owner name is blank. I've fixed that.
    I've changed config template to be disable admin role.
    Can you review that again?

    could you check if it's related? https://travis-ci.org/yu74n/zeppelin/builds/299517426

    CI failed at testRunOnSelectionChange()
    ```bash
    java.lang.AssertionError: Even if 'RunOnSelectionChange' is set as false, still can run the paragraph by pressing ENTER 
    Expected: "My selection is 1"
    but: was "My selection is 2"
    ```
    This test is related to 'Run on selection change' checkbox in paragraph menu.
    I think the reason why that test is failed would be timing error,  cause of the test code ran the paragraph before the checkbox was unchecked. Then I think the test is not related to my PR.
    
    I rerun the CI job manually, all tests are passed.
