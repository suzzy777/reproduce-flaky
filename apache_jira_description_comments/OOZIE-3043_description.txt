[maven surefire plugin|http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html] can be configured to run tests in a deterministic order via the {{runOrder}}. For example:
{quote}
Supported values are "alphabetical", "reversealphabetical", "random", "hourly" (alphabetical on even hours, reverse alphabetical on odd hours), "failedfirst", "balanced" and "filesystem".

Currently Oozie tests are running with the default "filesystem" setting. Different file systems (e.g. NTFS, ext) do not provide same ordering. Unfortunately, there are some Oozie flaky tests that do not seem independent from each other. We also saw hard to debug test failures caused by timeouts.

It might be better to run tests in "alphabetical" order. This way ordering would not vary from  filesystem to filesystem.

(On the other hand, we should keep identifying and fixing flaky tests. To do this, randomness could be actually a "good" thing.)
