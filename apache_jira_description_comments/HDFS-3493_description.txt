replication factor= 3, block report interval= 1min and start NN and 3DN

Step 1:Write a file without close and do hflush (Dn1,DN2,DN3 has blk_ts1)
Step 2:Stopped DN3
Step 3:recovery happens and time stamp updated(blk_ts2)
Step 4:close the file
Step 5:blk_ts2 is finalized and available in DN1 and Dn2
Step 6:now restarted DN3(which has got blk_ts1 in rbw)

From the NN side there is no cmd issued to DN3 to delete the blk_ts1 . But ask DN3 to make the block as corrupt .
Replication of blk_ts2 to DN3 is not happened.
