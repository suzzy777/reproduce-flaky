The issue is that the amount of time the test takes is highly variable to it being biased towards creating a condition where the test has to retry the compaction it is attempting.

Solution is to decrease the bias by having https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/ColumnFamilyStore.java#L2522 check every millisecond instead of every 100 milliseconds.
