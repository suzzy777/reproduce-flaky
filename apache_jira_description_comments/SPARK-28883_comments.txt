Marked this is a 3.0.0 blocker. We should either fix the issue and re-enable the test or just revert changes before 3.0.0.

Sounds good for targeting 3.0.0. I'll revert this if it doesn't get fixed within 3.0.0.

Would SPARK-30345 be a complement of this? Or does this issue cover more cases?

I think the issue has been fixed.
