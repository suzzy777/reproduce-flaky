{{CassandraRoleManager}} blocks some functionality during setup, using a delay added in CASSANDRA-9761 . Unfortunately, this setup is scheduled for 10s after startup, and may not be necessary, meaning immediately after startup some auth related queries may not behave as intended. We can skip this delay without any additional risk.
