Currently, failonerror is hard coded to false for the "test" task at the top level scope.  For jenkins runs, it would be useful to be able to configure this because:
1) unit tests runs are flaky
2) jenkins can detect test failures even if the the test task itself passes and mark the build yellow (which happens if failonerror is true)

Therefore, this allows some nicer visualization of the jenkins history, i.e.:
green if everything is good
yellow if unit tests are failing (most likely flaky)
red if compile / precommit, etc are broken
