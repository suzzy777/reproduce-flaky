h2. What is the purpose of this change
 * Fixing a flaky test to avoid shared state pollution {{org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.regionserver.TestDrainReplicationQueuesForStandBy.test}}

h2. Reproduce the test failure
 * Run the test twice in the same JVM.

h2. Expected result:
 * The test should run successfully when multiple tests that use this state are run in the same JVM.

h2. Actual result:
 * We get the failure:

 {{org.apache.hadoop.hbase.DoNotRetryIOException: Can not transit current cluster state from STANDBY to STANDBY for peer id=1}}
h2. Why the test fails
 * When the test ends, current cluster for peer id=1 is STANDBY, it can not be transitted from STANDBY to STANDBY.

h2. Fix
 * Reset the state when test ends.
