    IGNITE-8712 Should wait until continuous query notifies all nodes.

----


Data structures store information about their state (meta information) in the metacache (cache key is the name of datastructure instance).
 When accessing data structure, a separate instance (*one per node*) is created and cached in the local datastructures Map.
 When data structure method close() is invoked the item is removed from the metacache and continuous query listener uses to nofify all nodes to remove associated local instance from local datastru—Åtures Map.
 The problem occurs if the listener is notified asynchronously and the transaction (that initiated update event) ends earlier.
 The listener on the *non-affinity node* is notified *synchronously* only if {{sync}} flag of CacheContinuousQueryHandler is set to true, but for now this flag is always set to false (except JCacheQuery). I updated signature of method executeInternalQuery() in CacheContinuousQueryManager to change the value of this flag.

Btw, I found that this flaky failure has the same reason and will be fixed: [IgnitePartitionedSemaphoreSelfTest.testIsolation|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&buildTypeId=&tab=testDetails&testNameId=-1569365879053619530&order=TEST_STATUS_DESC&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=<default>&itemsCount=50]

And I believe that this flaky failure will be fixed too: [IgniteDataStructureUniqueNameTest.testCreateRemove|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&buildTypeId=&tab=testDetails&testNameId=9004139438366655173&order=TEST_STATUS_DESC&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=<default>&itemsCount=50]


Looks good.

100 runs on TC: https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1386878&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_DataStructures&tab=testsInfo

Merged to master.

[~xtern] Thanks, for the contribution!
