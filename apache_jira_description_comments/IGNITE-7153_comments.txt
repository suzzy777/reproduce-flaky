I concerned about test failures
- IgniteClientTestSuite: RedisProtocolConnectSelfTest.testSetBigObject1
- IgniteClientTestSuite: RedisProtocolStringSelfTest.testGetSet - 0,0% fails in last 571 master runs.

It may be related by the proposed change.

Hi [~dpavlov] [~mcfongtw],

We stumbled on this issue while setting up Ignite as our caching solution. We feel that it is critical to fix the issue.

I tried to see why the tests are failing but CI says `Build with id '2137608' not found`, possibly CI not retaining this old build.

Can you please help me out how can I run the CI for the PR, find out what is blocking this change and possibly solve it?

Thank You

Hi [~palnabarun] , [~mcfongtw]

I've triggered one more build on TC to double check. It is expected that too old build is not available now. Let's check results tomorrow.

Sincerely,
Dmitriy Pavlov

Hi [~palnabarun], unfortunately current PR code and master have diverged strongly, there is not possible  without upgrading PR's state to current master to say if this change is safe or not.

TC bot compares state of tests in master and in current PR, so merge of current master into branch is required to get representative tests results.

Hi [~dpavlov], I also inferred the same looking at the CI results. So, I am patching the changes on top of master and will be creating a new PR.

 

Can we tag this issue as part of the 2.8.1 milestone? I see that the scope freeze is due on 15th April.

 

 

[~dpavlov] [~palnabarun] I have rebased the pull request created by [~mcfongtw] on top of latest master and created another pull request.  I am assuming the CI run will happen automatically. 

[~ashu210890] I have filed a new [PR][1] fixing the CI reported lint errors.

[~dpavlov] Can you please review the changes and suggest how to move ahead?
