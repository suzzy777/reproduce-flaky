IMPALA-8638: Fix flaky TestLineage::test_create_table_timestamp

This patch fixes the bug TestLineage::test_create_table_timestamp where
it uses the same lineage log directory created by
TestLineage::test_start_end_timestamp, which could fail the query ID
assertion. The fix is to use a different lineage log directory than the
one used by TestLineage::test_start_end_timestamp.

Testing:
- Ran test_lineage.py multiple times and it still passed.
