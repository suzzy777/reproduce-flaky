hiveserver2 is start seeing the memory pressure once the cachedUnionStructObjectInspector start going 

[https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/objectinspector/ObjectInspectorFactory.java#L345]

I did not see any eviction policy for cachedUnionStructObjectInspector, so we should implement some size or time-based eviction policy.
