Dmitry, 

My comments:
1) Code conventions violated: tabs of 8 chars instead of 4, abbreviations in method names (txCfg -> transactionConfiguration()), "catch" on the same line as curly braces.
2) Two txCfg() methods in GridCacheAdapter and IgniteTransactionsImpl is obvious code duplication. There should be single method in GridCacheUtils. E.g.:
{code}
TransactionConfiguration transactionConfiguration(@Nullable GridCacheContext ctx, IgniteConfiguration cfg)
{code}
3) Do not create new {{TransactionConfiguration}} on each call. Instead, you should create it once in either static variable or inside shared cache context, and use it.

Vladimir.

Dmitry,

1) Code conventions are sill violated in IgniteTxConfigCacheSelfTest:
149: unused parameter "ignite"
152: arguments -> args
156: missing line break
181: redundant line break
228: arguments -> args
229: 8 spaces for tab instead of 4
232: missing line break

2) Moreover, this test appears to be prone to flaky failures because TX timeout is equal to sleep time. You should multiply TX sleep time in several times to make the test stable.

The rest looks fine. Please fix that and re-run tests. Once they are finished, re-assign back to me.

Vladimir.

Thanks for the review, Vladimir. All notes are corrected.
