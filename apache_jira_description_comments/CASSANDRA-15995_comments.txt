[~dcapwell] I see this test failure was on 3.11. Do we have an instance of this failing in trunk/4.0? I haven't been able to reproduce, yet.

would need to look at my circle ci backlog; I know SASIIndexTest is flaky in trunk but it is possible that a different test is the flaky one on trunk.

checked my circle CI and couldn't find an example in the past month.  I check another system and didn't find it failing there either; below are all the failures seen in the last 50 builds (not circle ci).

{code}
class_name|method_name|count(*)
org.apache.cassandra.net.MessageSerializationPropertyTest|testMessageSerialization|2
org.apache.cassandra.service.ActiveRepairServiceTest|testQueueWhenPoolFullStrategy|1
org.apache.cassandra.tools.SSTableExportTest|testSSTableExport_WithArgs|1
org.apache.cassandra.repair.consistent.PendingRepairStatTest|pendingRepairStats|2
org.apache.cassandra.transport.frame.checksum.ChecksummingTransformerTest|corruptionCausesFailure|7
org.apache.cassandra.net.ConnectionTest|testMessagePurging|13
{code}

Given this, ill move it out of 4.0

Thanks. After looping this on trunk overnight, no failures materialized. I'm going to set it aside for now.
