Relating to where this comes from.

The original idea of having a top-level handlers as plugins is rather invasive and we could do it if/when needed.

Vanilla health check handler for Solr, w/ tests, and SolrJ support.

This check if the node is connected to zk, and also if it is listed in live_nodes. There are more checks I wish to add here, but this is a good starting point.

Also, this allows for the handler to be extended just the way other admin handlers can be extended.
This also doesn't have any v2 support right now.

SOLR-11126: Node-level health check handler, with SolrJ support


# It is a bad idea to do {{updateLiveNodes}} on each invocation of the handler. I think the watcher is good enough. # Can you change the logging to debug level?
# We shouldn't be creating new handlers which aren't available in the v2 path anymore. Can you add a v2 equivalent for this handler?
# Can't we use this for non-cloud cases as well? Perhaps add a param (cloud=true?) to signal that the response should be OK only when running in cloud mode
# If we do the above, we can add a param for core and then deprecate the PingRequestHandler and eventually remove it.

Thanks for taking a look at this [~shalin].

I've changed the logging to debug, and also removed the {{updateLiveNodes()}} call from the code.

In terms of getting this to work for standalone mode too, the PING request handler as of now is distributed and is kind of orthogonal from the intent with which this was added. I think we should be able to support both off the same handler, but I would want to give it more thought instead of just moving the code for standalone mode here.

Did you intend to just get the PING handler to work for standalone mode, without deprecating ? If so, that's rather simple, but as I mentioned earlier, I'd want to give it a little more thought. Feel free to chime in if you think I didn't understand you well.

SOLR-11126: Remove unused import from HealthCheckHandler


Also, about the v2 support, it might make more sense for this to only be supported as a v2 API in that case. I don't see any reason why this should have an older API equivalent. What do you think?

NOTE: If this gets backported, please make sure to backport the test fixes in SOLR-11456 as well.

[~anshumg]: This issue is in CHANGES for 7.1 but it's still open and it doesn't look like the commits were backported, i.e., I don't see the backport commits here and don't find {{solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/admin/HealthCheckHandler.java}} in branch_7_1. Did it get into the 7.1 CHANGES by accident?

[~ctargett] sorry about missing the comments here. Yes, it shouldn't have been in 7.1 as this isn't back ported yet. I'll work on it this week and wrap it up.

I'm not sure about what's a good way to fix it now that 7.1 has been released. I do feel like removing it from the change log from master so it doesn't make it to the 7.2 log. Suggestions?

SOLR-11126: Remove wrong change log entry from 7.1 section


Patch that changes the API to only be on the lines of the new v2 APIs. The health check handler can be invoked using:
{code}
/api/node/health
{code}

FYI, the test doesn't work because of the changed path. I'll fix that and update the test.

Hi [~anshumg], thank you for adding this handler, this can be used in the cloud-native environment for liveliness check.

I don't see the handler definition in the official documentation, is there any specific reason behind the same? i.e. tests are not stable or we need to add more checks. I am willing to work to complete what's remaining.

I tested it in my 7.5.0 with [http://localhost:8983/api/node/health] but it looks like it expects a core? Just returns:
{code:javascript}
{
  "error": {
    "metadata": [
      "error-class",
      "org.apache.solr.common.SolrException",
      "root-error-class",
      "org.apache.solr.common.SolrException"
    ],
    "msg": "no core retrieved for null",
    "code": 404
  }
}

2018-12-14 08:34:01.490 ERROR (qtp769429195-21) [   ] o.a.s.a.V2HttpCall Error in init()

{code}

Ok, I guess the /api/node/health was never committed, but I could not get /solr/admin/health to work for 7.5 or 7.6, but it works in master...

Integrated SOLR-11126-v2.patch into fresh one: SOLR-11126.patch against *{{master}}* branch and changed the V1 API path to *{{/admin/info/health}}* and V2 API *{{/api/node/health}}* is now supported.

The V1 API path is changed and moved under InfoHandler in conjunction to already supported V2 APIs listed in https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_5/implicit-requesthandlers.html.

*  added another negative test when CoreContainer is not available (null or shutdown)
*  removed redundant overridden methods
*  added relevant documentation

Tests and Precommit pass. Requesting review and feedback.

[~janhoy]- you couldn't get it to work in 7.5 or 7.6 because it never made it to that. It is just in master.

[~sarkaramrit2@gmail.com] - will take a look, thanks for picking this one up.

Thanks Amrit. A few comments:

# The CommonParams used to have {{/admin/health}} but now has {{/admin/info/health}}. It is okay to change the path because this API has never been released but there is some inconsistency because ImplicitPlugins.json still has {{"/admin/health"}}
# HealthCheckHandler -- the {{cores != null} check is redundant and the if condition can be simplified to {{if(cores == null || cores.isShutDown())}}
# HealthCheckHandler -- redundant return statement at the end of the handleRequestBody method
# Please make a note in the reference guide that this health check handler is only available in solrcloud mode
# There should be at least one test which tests the v2 API
# The test can make use of the expectThrows pattern. See the changes made in SOLR-12555 for examples.

Thanks Shalin for the feedback. I see there are some details left to clean up and add. On it.

Fresh patch uploaded, incorporating all suggestions made above. Thank you.

Thanks Amrit. The changes look good to me. I'll commit after running precommit and tests.

I found a reproducible failure for the test:
{code}
ant test  -Dtestcase=HealthCheckHandlerTest -Dtests.method=testHealthCheckHandlerSolrJ -Dtests.seed=48599B8D10B62191 -Dtests.slow=true -Dtests.badapples=true -Dtests.locale=en-AU -Dtests.timezone=Europe/Mariehamn -Dtests.asserts=true -Dtests.file.encoding=ANSI_X3.4-1968
{code}

[~sarkaramrit2@gmail.com] -- can you please take a look? Also, beast the test a few times to ensure it is not flaky.

Thanks, Shalin, apologies you had to review multiple times. I didn't think this point through and moved forward with changes:

bq. The CommonParams used to have /admin/health but now has /admin/info/health. It is okay to change the path because this API has never been released but there is some inconsistency because ImplicitPlugins.json still has "/admin/health"

The following is mentioned in the {{ImplicitPlugins}} documentation: 

{code}
System Settings	
Return server statistics and settings.

Documentation: https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SystemInformationRequestHandlers#SystemInfoHandler

API Endpoints	Class & Javadocs	Paramset
v1: solr/admin/info/system

v2: api/node/system
{solr-javadocs}/solr-core/org/apache/solr/handler/admin/SystemInfoHandler.html[SystemInfoHandler]
_ADMIN_SYSTEM
This endpoint can also take the collection or core name in the path (solr/<collection>/admin/system or solr/<core>/admin/system) which will include all of the system-level information and additional information about the specific core that served the request.
{code}

All the InfoHandlers are available with {{/solr/<collection>/admin/<endpoint>}}; which is essentially utilized by SolrClient. Thus, all info endpoints are mentioned in ImplicitPlugins.json.

{code}
    "/admin/plugins": {
      "class": "solr.PluginInfoHandler"
    },
    "/admin/threads": {
      "class": "solr.ThreadDumpHandler",
      "useParams":"_ADMIN_THREADS"
    },
    "/admin/properties": {
      "class": "solr.PropertiesRequestHandler",
      "useParams":"_ADMIN_PROPERTIES"
    },
    "/admin/logging": {
      "class": "solr.LoggingHandler",
      "useParams":"_ADMIN_LOGGING"
    },
{code}

Since this endpoint is available only in Solrcloud mode, I have added another line in the documentation. Beasts 100 rounds run successfully, precommit pass.

This is interesting. The system, thread, logging, properties and now health are registered with the InfoHandler at {{/info/}} path. This InfoHandler is registered by default in the CoreContainer and there seems to be no way to skip it. However, the implicit plugins json again defines each of these sub-handlers directly under the {{/admin/}} path. So each of these handlers are accessibly through two paths. Also, because the useParams defined in the Implicit plugins is for {{/admin/xyz}} handler, the paramset won't be applied if the same handler is accessed using the {{/admin/info/xyz}} path.

[~noble.paul] - do you know why it is done this way? we may need another issue to clean this up in 8.0

[~sarkaramrit2@gmail.com] -- Solr fails to start because each implicit request handler must have a default constructor and HealthCheckHandler only has one which accepts a CoreContainer parameter.

Ah :( Right. Didn't fail to start for me but yes fails to create the collection due to the missing constructor. Patch uploaded. Added new test for checking collection creation. {{ant test}}, {{beasts}}, {{precommit}} pass. checked properly.

This issue can be resolved?

[~janhoy] yes I believe, the patch is committed.

[~shalin], [~anshumg], please resolve this if you're done :)

This issue was only committed for 8.0 but I mentioned it in version 7.7. I'll fix that and then resolve it.
