Pretty trivial; waits for regions to get assigned before go to an RS and asking for its regions.

Uploaded a one-liner for branch-1. Can do the same for 0.98 and master if necessary.

Oops, sorry - did some Git silly. Trying again with a proper patch...

lgtm

Should this issue be Minor ?

Sure, [~tedyu]; I can never remember when to call something major or minor :-p. Thanks.

why instead of fixing each getHBaseAdmin().createTable() call don't you put that inside createTable() of testing util? I think that everyone assumes that regions are online.

So createTable() in HBaseTestingUtility already has the waitUntilAllRegionsAssigned. In this case, I just added the call to the wait because HBTU didn't have a createTable method that takes splitKeys, but I can add one of those instead of adding the call. More fundamentally, should we consider whether HBA#createTable itself should be synchronous up through the region assignments being made?

On a separate note, [~mbertozzi], is the SnapshotTestingUtils#waitForTableToBeOnline right to be doing nothing with the boolean returned by isTableAvailable? It looks like you might have created the method and I wasn't sure whether to touch it with this JIRA.

This begs the question why assignment isn't a necessary precondition for a table to be online (it is of course):

{code}
@@ -643,6 +643,7 @@ public class SnapshotTestingUtils {
     }
     byte[][] splitKeys = getSplitKeys();
     util.getHBaseAdmin().createTable(htd, splitKeys);
+    util.waitUntilAllRegionsAssigned(tableName);
     waitForTableToBeOnline(util, tableName);
     assertEquals((splitKeys.length + 1) * regionReplication,
         util.getHBaseAdmin().getTableRegions(tableName).size());
{code}

bq. In short, some tests in TestRestoreSnapshot... create a table and then invoke SnapshotTestingUtils#waitForTableToBeOnline, but this method assumes that regions have been assigned by the time it's invoked

Why not fix that?

That's a fair point, [~apurtell], and I'll post up a patch doing that. Is it worth separately addressing why the [synchronous] HBaseAdmin#createTable method returns before a table is actually ready to accept puts? If that was fixed, there wouldn't need to be these helper methods checking for regions being available in HBTU.

bq. Is it worth separately addressing why the [synchronous] HBaseAdmin#createTable method returns before a table is actually ready to accept puts? 

We could. I'd suggest checking if the new Admin interface has the semantics you want as an option and if not file an issue for that. 

Addressed Matteo's suggestion of putting the waitUntilAllRegionsOnline call in HBaseTestingUtility#createTable. In this case, that meant adding another overloaded method and, in the process, refactoring an existing one that took a byte[] tableName to simply invoke my new TableName tableName variant. Finally, I did a bit of tidying of SnapshotTestingUtils (clean up stale imports and add a waitFor around a call to #isTableAvailable).
