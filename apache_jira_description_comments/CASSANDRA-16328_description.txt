When we try to run the upgrade tests for trunk, we get tests such as upgrade_tests.cql_tests.TestCQLNodes2RF1_Upgrade_indev_2_2_x_To_indev_3_0_x to run, which do not include the trunk source.  Since these tests are costly and can be flaky, running the unneeded tests for a release increases the cost and can make it harder to see if any new failures.
