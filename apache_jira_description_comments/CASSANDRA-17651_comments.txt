Probably a dup of CASSANDRA-17641

I just merged CASSANDRA-17636 which looks like it might solve the root cause of the problem - delivering messages when the messaging service is usually shut down.

Agreed CASSANDRA-17636 is the root cause. Optimistically closing all these duplicates and we can reopen if needed.

Did this just fail again today? https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-4.1/86/testReport/

EDIT: It's a different failure, but this is already linked to Butler...so repurpose it? :D

Mmmmm it failed but in a new way. I guess we keep this ticket open then

The failure can be reproduced on CircleCI with the test multiplexer:
{code}
.circleci/generate.sh -m \
  -e REPEATED_JVM_UPGRADE_DTEST_CLASS=org.apache.cassandra.distributed.upgrade.BatchUpgradeTest \
  -e REPEATED_JVM_UPGRADE_DTEST_COUNT=500
{code}
It seems to have [a flakiness of around 1%|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1915/workflows/231a7018-df32-45d1-a1be-265d86922d39/jobs/19106].

The test [survives 500 iterations|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1916/workflows/1b54b401-8ff3-4a48-b7a9-3ad14dfc97f6/jobs/19107] if we use {{spinAssertEquals}} to wait for the processing of the stored batch mutations, [this way|https://github.com/adelapena/cassandra/commit/ce9dfc06cbed0fef88b422a313fdcc73459d13ea].

+1, thanks!

I was looking/following this one as well as it sounded very familiar to the GroupCommitLogTest (17232 ). +1 from me as well.

Thanks for the reviews. Here is a final CI round for 4.1 and trunk before committing, without any test failures:
