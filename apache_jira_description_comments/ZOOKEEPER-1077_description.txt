Hello,

Some minor trouble with building ZooKeeper C client library on Sun^H^H^HOracle Solaris 5.10.

1. You need to link against "-lnsl -lsocket"

2. ctime_r needs a buffer size. The signature is: "char *ctime_r(const time_t *clock, char *buf, int buflen)"

3. In zk_log.c you need to manually cast pid_t to int (-Werror can be cumbersome ;) )

4. getpwuid_r()returns pointer to struct passwd, which works as the last parameter on Linux.

Solaris signature: struct passwd *getpwuid_r(uid_t  uid,  struct  passwd  *pwd, char *buffer, int  buflen); 
Linux signature: int getpwuid_r(uid_t uid, struct passwd *pwd, char *buf, size_t buflen, struct passwd **result);
