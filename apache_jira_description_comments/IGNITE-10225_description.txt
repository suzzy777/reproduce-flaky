StripedExecutor::checkStarvation checks if two conditions are met: a stripe is executing a job and the stripe's job counter hasn't changed since the last check.
These conditions will be met if no jobs have been executed for a long time and a job (even a very short one) has just started.

This check isn't supposed to be exact and allowed to produce false-positives. However, the check is supposed to detect jobs running for more than starvation check interval (IGNITE_STARVATION_CHECK_INTERVAL), but in this case it may detect even very short ones.

To fix this we may require a stripe to have no progress in two consecutive checks - then we will have much less chance for a false-positive, but still detect hanging or very long jobs.
