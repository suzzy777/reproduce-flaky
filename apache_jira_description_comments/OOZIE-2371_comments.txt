Targetting this as a blocker for Oozie 5.  We really should have this info.

Hi!

I've added some documentation for workflow action state transitions.

However, there are some things that I'm not sure about, any help would be appreciated. [~rkanter] can you please address those?

I'm not sure what the state {{USER_RETRY}} means. It would be logical if the action entered this state when a user manually retries the action, for example after {{START_MANUAL}}, but from the code it seems that this state is entered automatically in the {{ActionXCommand#handleUserRetry}} method, which is called from {{ActionXCommand#handleError}}, for example when running the test {{TestWorkflowActionRetryInfoXCommand#testRetryConsoleUrl}}.

Another thing is what final states are accessible from {{END_RETRY}} and {{END_MANUAL}}. In the test {{TestActionErrors#testEndNonTransient}}, the action transitions from {{END_MANUAL}} to {{OK}} at the end, but this is a 'test' action and the {{ActionExecutor}} is a {{ForTestingActionExecutor}}, which is not a "real", used-in-production {{ActionExecutor}}. The executor calls {{setEndData}} on the context which calls {{setEndData}} on the {{WorkflowActionBean}} instance that sets the status.
I decided to include the transition in the documentation because other {{ActionExecutor}} s' end methods do mainly the same thing (for example {{JavaActionExecutor}}), that is, set the action status according to the {{externalStatus}} string.
For the {{END_RETRY}} state, I wasn't able to find an instance of transition to a final state.

Thanks a lot,
Daniel

Thanks for the contribution!

I believe the user_retry and similar statuses are triggered when the retry count is explicitly set in the xml. You can find some information about that [here|https://oozie.apache.org/docs/4.3.0/WorkflowFunctionalSpec.html#a18_User-Retry_for_Workflow_Actions_since_Oozie_3.1]


I've added some more info and a link according to the comment of [~gezapeti].

The failed tests are probably unrelated flakiness as the patch doesn't touch the code, only the docs.

Committed to master! Thanks for the contribution! 

Closing issue; Oozie 5.0.0-beta1 is released
