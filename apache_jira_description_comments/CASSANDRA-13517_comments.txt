Closing for now as it doesn't seem to be a problem of late.

This test appears to still be flaky.

The test fails this way intermittently, but consistently on a resource-constrained VM. Failures are characterized by driver heartbeat timeouts which [exits the worker|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/49f46fce94c8f25f32e9b778ded8b14c30ad851e/paxos_test.py#L145-L149] and does not retry. I think the server and cluster are just being overwhelmed. This never fails on a well-provisioned machine.

The proposed change creates a client connection with ample timeouts and heartbeats disabled. I'm also reducing the concurrency from one arbitrary number to another slightly smaller arbitrary number to make it a bit more appropriate in the envelope of a single-host three-node test cluster.

Can we loop like 100 times the updated test on this resource-constrained VM? 

(not a review, that I can do tomorrow :) )

I did loop it about 50 times before submitting the patch. Before it would easily fail one in five times in the VM. It failed zero in 50. I started the loop again.

-The test failed in CI.-

[~brandon.williams], I think the run you linked did not run against my dtest branch.

Whoops, you're right.  Updated.

[~e.dimitrova] my local spin count is >200 with zero failures. Previous fail rate in this VM was 1/5.

+1

Thanks [~aholmber], I am also +1, the CI is still running so in order to be politically correct I will commit the patch when CI run is over later today :) 

CI looks fine; 1 unrelated failure.

Committed [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/commit/af190977b64176fdcbca296cb49089ce8cb57266]. Thanks!
