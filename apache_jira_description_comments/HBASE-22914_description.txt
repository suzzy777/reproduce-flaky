HBASE-20662 listst 2.2.0 as one of the fix versions, but the release 2.2.0 doesn't contain the commit as seen here: [https://github.com/apache/hbase/commits/rel/2.2.0/hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/quotas/TestSpaceQuotas.java] here TestSpaceQuotas was actually changed in HBASE-20662 but the release tag doesn't list that. Removing the fix version of 2.2.0 from the parent Jira and opening thisJira for the missing backport.
