DS publishes container start/stop events using sync API. If back end is  down for some reasons, then DS will hang till container start/stop events are published. By default, retry is 30 and interval is 1sec.

To publish single entity using sync API will take 1 minutes to come out. In case of DS, if number of containers are 10 then 10minutes for start event and 10minutes for stop event. Overall 20 minutes will wait.

 

DS should publish container events using asyn api.
