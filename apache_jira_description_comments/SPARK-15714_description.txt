BlacklistIntegrationSuite (introduced by SPARK-10372) is a bit flaky because of some race conditions:

1. Failed jobs might have non-empty results, because the resultHandler will be invoked for successful tasks (if there are task successes before failures)

2. {{taskScheduler.taskIdToTaskSetManager}} must be protected by a lock on {{taskScheduler}}
