IMPALA-10888: sort partitions by name before comparing in test

CatalogHmsFileMetadataTest and EnableCatalogdHmsCacheFlagTest
compare the partition filemetada which is returned over by
get_partitions_by_names HMS API. However, the catalogd's
implementation of API does not return the partitions in a
deterministic order. Hence the tests can fail intermittently.

The patch sorts the returned partitions by names before
making any comparisons to avoid the flakiness of the test.

Testing:
1. Modified existing test to do the sorting before
asserting the filemetadata comparison.
