When trying to do a -dryrun for Oozie:
{code}
error:
Error: E1310 : E1310: Bundle Job submission Error: [null]
{code}

The [documentation|https://oozie.apache.org/docs/4.2.0/DG_CommandLineTool.html#Dryrun_of_Coordinator_Job] states that dryruns are working for workflows and coordinators.
{quote}
"Dryrun a workflow (since 3.3.2) or coordinator (since 2.0) job without actually executing it"

The easy fix is to document that it does not work and create an appropriate error message for it. It's also possible to add support for bundle dryruns.
