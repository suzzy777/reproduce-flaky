When running a preview repair we currently grab all repaired sstables, problem is that we depend on compaction to move the sstables from pending to repaired so we might have different data marked repaired on different nodes. Including any sstables from finalized incremental repair sessions as repaired will solve this.

Another problem is that validations don't start at exactly the same time on different nodes, so if an incremental repair finishes while the preview repair is running we might also validate the wrong repaired set. We should fail the preview repair if an intersecting incremental repair finishes during the preview repair.
