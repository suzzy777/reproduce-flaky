I've seen this test fail in a few different ways, I wonder if we should disable it for now and track the fix via this JIRA?

Upon closer inspection, this test is actually not running. It has been "disabled" with:

{code}
public void testConnectionAfterTicketTimeout() throws Exception {
   if ("true".equalsIgnoreCase(System.getProperty("sentry.hive.test.ticket.timeout", "false"))) {
     // Execute test logic
   }
{code}

the failure is happening in setup() step when attempting to connect to the Sentry Service.

From the [RB|https://reviews.apache.org/r/25520/] details of the jira which added this test, it looks like this test is not supposed to run on automation runs. Hence I think it is safe to ignore it. But we should run this atleast once per release, to make sure we do not regress. Not sure how to enforce that, any ideas?

Thanks, +1 for the change. The only comment is to reference this JIRA in the @Ignore message. Once the test is disabled, I don't think there is any good way to enforce it is run before release other than keeping this JIRA open and marking it as a Blocker. Either way, I think we should keep this JIRA open to understand whether this is actually a test or product issue. I spent some time looking through the ticket renewal code and I didn't notice any obvious bugs, but may have missed something.


Attaching an updated patch, now referencing this jira # in the ignore message.

Committed to master. Thanks [~sravya].
