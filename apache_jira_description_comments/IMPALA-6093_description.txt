Saw this at commit: 2187d36... IMPALA-6045: Make build scripts more friendly to Ubuntu 16.04

The test seems fundamentally flaky, since the behaviour will change if there are enough other threads were running simultaneously and taking up threads that the query couldn't start an async build thread. It's worth thinking about how we can make this less flaky without losing coverage.
