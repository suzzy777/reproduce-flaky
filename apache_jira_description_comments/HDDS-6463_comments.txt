Ozone 1.3.0 had been released and we currently have more than 600 open issues targeted for 1.3.0. I am moving the target field to 1.4.0.

What if anything needs to be discussed about the Target Version, Please reach out to me via Apache email or Slack.

[~adoroszlai] As per my understanding, we need to split all robot tests here, so that they can run in parallel here? Kindly confirm.

Acceptance test splits in CI are defined by the {{suite}} matrix variable here:

{code:title=https://github.com/apache/ozone/blob/5d5eb45d14952056faaf2150db273a2f152ff867/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L241-L260}
  acceptance:
    needs:
      - build-info
      - build
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    timeout-minutes: 150
    if: needs.build-info.outputs.needs-compose-tests == 'true'
    strategy:
      matrix:
        suite:
          - secure
          - unsecure
          - compat
          - EC
          - HA-secure
          - HA-unsecure
          - MR
          - misc
          - cert-rotation
      fail-fast: false
{code}

(Proposed to replace this with a script, getting list of suites dynamically in HDDS-9270.)

Each split executes test scripts under {{hadoop-ozone/dist/src/main/compose}} subdirectories, filtering by suite definition.  E.g. this one belongs to the EC split:

{code:title=https://github.com/apache/ozone/blob/5d5eb45d14952056faaf2150db273a2f152ff867/hadoop-ozone/dist/src/main/compose/ozone/test-ec.sh#L18}
#suite:EC
{code}

To create finer grained acceptance test splits, we should define new, distinct values for {{suite}}.  Since each test script belongs to only one suite, we can extract parts of the existing {{test.sh}} scripts into smaller {{test-xyz.sh}} scripts.  Try to keep these extracted scripts logically coherent.

Ok thanks [~adoroszlai] , I think I understood the objective now of this JIRA. I can work on this one.

HDDS-9270 is done, so {{ci.yml}} no longer needs to be modified when introducing new acceptance test splits.

[~adoroszlai] Planning to split some of the tests in 
ozone/test.sh:#suite:unsecure based on features:
  * test-recon.sh
 * test-freon.sh
 * test-cli.sh
 * test-basic.sh
 * test-snapshot.sh

 

And do you know why "test-s3-haproxy.sh" is not defined under any suite to run as separate ?

bq. why "test-s3-haproxy.sh" is not defined under any suite to run as separate?

Probably unintentionally.  Test scripts without explicit {{#suite:}} are included in the {{misc}} run, so it's not a big problem:

{code:title=https://github.com/apache/ozone/blob/3cf721e2d78a9f36598f908156b911b9ddb42306/hadoop-ozone/dist/src/main/compose/testlib.sh#L53-L59}
     # 'misc' is default suite, add untagged tests, too
    if [[ "misc" == "${OZONE_ACCEPTANCE_SUITE}" ]]; then
       untagged="$(all_tests_in_immediate_child_dirs | xargs grep -L "^#suite:")"
       if [[ -n "${untagged}" ]]; then
         tests=$(echo ${tests} ${untagged} | xargs -n1 | sort)
       fi
     fi
{code}

Splitting acceptance tests by "topic" increases total CI time, because:

# additional time is required to start/stop the cluster for each test script
# matrix job parallelism is limited

So, on second thought, we should keep most tests in the same test run.  Of course, tests that require special cluster setup (number of nodes or config) must be in separate scripts.  But other than that, we may extract known flaky tests into a separate suite, similar to the one for integration tests.
