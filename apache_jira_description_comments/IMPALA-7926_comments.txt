IMPALA-7926: Fix flakiness in test_reconnect

test_reconnect launches a shell that connects to one impalad in the
minicluster then reconnects to a different impalad while checking that
the impalad's open session metric changes accordingly.

To do this, the test gets the number of open sessions at the start of
the test and then expects that the number of sessions will have
increased by 1 on the impalad that the shell is currently connected
to.

This can be a problem if there is a session left over from another
test that is still active when test_reconnect starts but exits while
it's running.

test_reconnect is already marked to run serially, so there shouldn't
be any other sessions open while it runs anyways. The solution is to
wait at the start of the test until any sessions left over from other
tests have exited.

Testing:
- Ran the test in an environment where the timing was previously
  causing it to fail almost deterministically and it now passes.
