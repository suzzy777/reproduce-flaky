This test seems to be consistently passing after [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13465] was merged (timeout value for the read offsets operation in *OffsetsApiIntegrationTest*Â was bumped up) so I'm gonna mark this ticket as resolved. In case a failure re-occurs, this ticket can be re-opened for investigation.

It happened again here: https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka-pr/job/PR-14458/3/testReport/junit/org.apache.kafka.connect.integration/OffsetsApiIntegrationTest/Build___JDK_11_and_Scala_2_13___testGetSinkConnectorOffsetsDifferentKafkaClusterTargeted/
