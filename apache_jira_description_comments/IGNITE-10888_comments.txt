*Summary:*

In the .NET tests is checked that {{Service#execute}} has been called during deployment. This check is possible because of {{UnmanagedCallbacks.cs}} registered and called for services deployed from .Net client. See for details {{PlatformCallbackGateway.java, PlatformAbstractService.java}} for details.

But API (Service interface) does not guarantee the execution of {{Service#execute}} once deployment process is finished, the only guarantee is the execution of {{Service#init}}.

The test became flaky because of speedup deployment after IGNITE-9607, also {{Services#GetServiceDescriptors()}} became faster because of access to a local variable instead of distributed selection. That means sometimes callback has not been called before the check, it confirms with the fact that {{Assert.IsTrue(prx.Initialized)}} passes well all the times.

There are 2 options to fix the test:
1. Remove the check {{Assert.IsTrue(prx.Executed)}} because of lack guarantees
2. Introduce timeout to wait of the method's execution
