There is a race condition in two tests in TestPullReplicaErrorHandling where we expire a ZK session, then wait for a node down and a node up. It's possible that the node recovers before we even start waiting for the first down.

Better would be to set a watch on the live-node that we're about to expire, and wait to see the delete before checking for the node to come back up.
