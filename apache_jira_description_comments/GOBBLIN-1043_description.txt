In Gobblin Helix cluster, we encounter scenarios where a participant continues to work on a Helix partition even after the partition has been assigned by Helix to a different participant leading to duplicate consumption. We implement a check where each Helix task checks if it is indeed the currently assigned participant for the Helix partition. This check is implemented as a CommitStep and can be used as an assertion before data publish occurs.Â
