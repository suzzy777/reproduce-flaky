[~cloud_fan] [~hyukjin.kwon] Can I we disable the flaky test till someone makes it stable?

[~Qin Yao] do you have any clue?

There're two existing PRs addressing the test suite:

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28156
https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28055


I've merged https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28156

Let's see if the test is still flaky and we need https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28055
