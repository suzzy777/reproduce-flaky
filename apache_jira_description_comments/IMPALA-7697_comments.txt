[~bikramjeet.vig], is this a regression ? Any idea on why it started happening recently. Do you think it makes sense to check in an intermediate fix to unbreak the build for now ?

[~kwho] I haven't looked at this yet, but just looking at the description here, this seems like the expected behavior from how we handle query archiving. The only reason I can think of why this might be happening now can be some tests (running in parallel to this test) running faster than before, or running more queries than before that finish early. In any case I dont think this is a regression and I can take a deeper look at it later. If this is happening frequently we can check in the quick fix that Pooja suggested and that would unblock those builds.

I looked into the logs and this seems like a flaky test. The query completes in the given time of 2 sec and therefore does not get expired. (the logs in the description are for the SET query)

IMPALA-7697: Fix flakiness in test_resource_limits

This patch fixes one of the tests in test_resource_limits that expects a
query to run for more than 2 seconds but currently fails because it
sometimes completes earlier than that.
