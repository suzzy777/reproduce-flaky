Here is a patch which should fix the issue. Ran the test 100 times, it did not fail. 

Let's try it.
{code}
-    // However if we add a server, then the balance() call should return true 
+    // However if we add a server, then the balance() call should return true
{code}
nit: remove 'However' since the previous return value is 'true'.

+1 for trying it.

Thanks for reviews. Addressed nit in v2. 

Committed to hbase-10070.
