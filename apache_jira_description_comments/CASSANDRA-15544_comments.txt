[~brandon.williams] can you say a bit about the env this was reproduced on (circle/laptop/java8 or 11)? I've managed to reproduce some of the SASIIndexTest failures locally on java11 but haven't seen this one yet. 

Java 1.8.0_212 on Debian buster in a machine in our lab.  I was actually trying to reproduce another flaky SASI test and hit this instead on the first run.
