TheÂ StorageAttachedIndexDDLTest.concurrentTruncateWithIndexBuilding has been showing flakiness in test runs and need investigating and fixing. Looking at the failure is seems that there is an edge condition where the index will fail to complete its build if a table truncate is triggered at the right moment.

We need to try and provoke this edge condition using injection and then see what can be done to fix the build failure.
