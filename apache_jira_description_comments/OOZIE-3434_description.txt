It is possible for specifying the jobtype during jobs filter in the REST API and in the command line as well. Supported jobtypes are: {{wf}}, {{coord}}, {{bundle}}

If we filter for an invalid jobtype then the command line version does not print anything:

{noformat}$ oozie jobs -jobtype xxx
{noformat}

The REST api gives a JSON containing a NullPointerException:

{noformat}/ 20190219121114
// http://localhost:11000/oozie/v1/jobs?jobtype=xxx

{
  "errorMessage": "java.lang.NullPointerException",
  "httpStatusCode": 500
}
{noformat}

We should give a meaningful error message in this case like {{unrecognized jobtype: xxx}}
