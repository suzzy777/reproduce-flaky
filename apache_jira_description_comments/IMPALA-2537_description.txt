Lots of EE tests use a fixed table name. Because of this, tests have to be executed serially, otherwise they will be flaky, for example, throw error "Table not exist" when try to access it since another test instance drop the table already.

If a table is used by a single test case and only needed temporarily, we should use a unique table name (tablename+rand()) so the test could be executed in parallel for multiple test dimensions.
