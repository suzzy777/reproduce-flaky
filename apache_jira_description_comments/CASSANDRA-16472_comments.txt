One problem with this test is that it shortens the reset interval for testing, but then inserts/reads enough data that it can exceed the interval while doing so.  Even with less data though, on a slow enough machine it can still be reset, so the patch also allows the degraded reads to be off by exactly one so the snitch has a signal to stop reading from it and can get back on track.

Allowing for 1 extra read in case it races with a reset makes sense to me. +1 pending CI.

CASSANDRA-13196 failed again here [!https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/488/badge/icon!|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Cassandra-devbranch/detail/Cassandra-devbranch/488/pipeline]
 but I'll get to that next.  CI looks good otherwise. Committed.
