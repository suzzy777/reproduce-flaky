If it's related to watermark, possible problem commit: https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/84ef8aa21aa350fb248a60e88a0cb195118fe1f5, but IIUC, this commit should only affect direct runner.

I was digging through build.gradle files and Jenkins jobs to determine the runner for certain, and I did not see expected logs. It seems there is a misconfiguration, as I see:

{code}
Standard Error
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
{code}

I will say that if the runner is Dataflow then there is a design issue in the jobs. If somewhere deep in the stack there is something setting it to Dataflow, then that needs to be bubbled up to the top level. But I think this IT is testing direct runner with live Pubsub.

Just reproducing locally.

Scan at suspect commit: https://gradle.com/s/c26wtkpfaayuw (fail)

Scan at parent of suspect commit: https://gradle.com/s/gea2suqcv45vk (succeed)

Scan at master with suspect commit reverted: https://gradle.com/s/zy5z2mnneveps (succeed)

So I think rollback and then fix.

Based on the PR, this is no longer 'currently-failing'. Should it be closed as fixed as well?
