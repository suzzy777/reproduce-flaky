I tried the test of interest with some fixes. It is still failing intermittantly, mostly due to [https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3956. |https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3956]

Will take this up once the patch is landed. I also happened to test out this particular test with the linked patch, and it seems to run fine.Â
