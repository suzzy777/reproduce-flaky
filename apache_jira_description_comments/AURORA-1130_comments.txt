Assigning to [~wickman] who mentioned earlier today that he would look into this.

This stopped happening on its own. My guess is there was a review that introduced some flakiness in a test and once that review was updated the build started working again.

In any event, we added the verbose flag to the python test execution, so instances of this in the future should be easier to diagnose/fix.
