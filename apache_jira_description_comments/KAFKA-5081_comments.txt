    KAFKA-5081: force version for 'jackson-annotations' in order to prevent redundant jars from being bundled into kafka distribution (and to align with other jackson libraries)

    **JIRA ticket:** [KAFKA-5081 two versions of jackson-annotations-xxx.jar in distribution tgz](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5081)
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. accept this merge request **_OR_**
    2. upgrade jackson libraries to version **_2.9.x_** (currently available as a pre-release only)
    
    **Related jackson issue:** [Add explicit \`jackson-annotations\` dependency version for \`jackson-databind\`](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1545)
    
    **Note:** previous (equivalent) merge request #2900 ended up deep in the sand with swarm of messages due to flaky test, so I opted to close it and to open this one.
