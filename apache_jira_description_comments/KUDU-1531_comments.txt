This is worrying. We have a hash-partitioned table into 3 tablets, with a total of 20k rows, and we do a sorted scan. We "detect" going across tablet boundaries by simply checking if we're seeing a row key go down: https://github.com/cloudera/kudu/blob/master/java/kudu-client/src/test/java/org/kududb/client/ITScannerMultiTablet.java#L120

In this failure we detected four tablets, but I checked the logs and we only talked to 3 tablets (and sent 3 scans).

So it could mean that there's a bug in sorting.

I can count a few flushes and compactions that took place while scanning, could be related?

According to [~danburkert] we had some "funky things going on around opening tables" around the time this bug was filed. We think it may be fixed, but will leave it open. If anyone sees this reoccur please update this JIRA, otherwise will close after a couple months of no activity.

Per above comment, we haven't seen this in a while, so let's mark as cannot repro
