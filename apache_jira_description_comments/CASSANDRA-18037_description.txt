Most native functions are named all lower case, without underscore nor hyphen to separate words. That's the case, for example, of "intasblob" or "blobasint".

We also have some functions using camel case, as in "castAsInt" or "castAsTimestamp". Note that the came cased names require quoting due to CQL's case insensitivity.

Differently to CQL native functions, system keyspaces, tables and columns consistently use snake case. For example, we have "system_schema", "dropped_columns", "default_time_to_live".

As discussed in [this thread|https://lists.apache.org/thread/k9ml1k4fg6o7mfby1nr3y0mnq9r90dym], we should adopt snake_case for CQL native function names. Also we should provide aliases for the current function names, so we don't break compatibility.
