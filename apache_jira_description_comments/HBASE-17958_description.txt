ScanQueryMatcher.MatchCode qcode = matcher.match(cell);
qcode = optimize(qcode, cell);
{code}
The optimize method may change the MatchCode from SEEK_NEXT_COL/SEEK_NEXT_ROW to SKIP. But it still pass the next cell to ScanQueryMatcher. It will get wrong result when use some filter, etc. ColumnCountGetFilter. It just count the  columns's number. If pass a same column to this filter, the count result will be wrong. So we should avoid passing cell to ScanQueryMatcher when optimize SEEK to SKIP.
