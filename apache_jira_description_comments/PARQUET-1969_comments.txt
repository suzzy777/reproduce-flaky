[~yumwang], maybe it's only me who don't know much about github actions but could you please describe why it is better than the already existing configuration for Travis?

Travis has been broken for several days. I have tested GithubAction: https://github.com/wangyum/parquet-mr/actions/runs/529590762

   In my (admittedly limited) recent experience, travis support for open source projects is declining and github actions are becoming more popular for tests like these.  I switched one open source project by company manages from Travis to Github Actions and have been extremely pleased with the results.

Hi!

What exactly was the problem with "Travis has been broken for several days" (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-1969?focusedCommentId=17276833&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17276833) ?

Was TravisCI down ?

Or the Parquet build has been broken and TravisCI didn't notify you, so no one noticed for several days ?

 

I know GitHub Actions is the new fancy CI these days!

Many Apache projects moved to it and this led to some problems:

1) very long wait queue - many Apache projects fight for the same GitHub Actions builders (they are per organization). And few projects have very long build times (~10 hours)

2) due to security concerns any non-approved by Apache Infra Github action has been disabled for the whole org. This broke the setups of many Apache projects. There are long discussions at [builds@apache.org|mailto:builds@apache.org]

3) GitHub actions does not support non-x86_64 hardware and I was hoping to add testing on ARM64 to prevent regressions once PARQUET-1975 is fixed

[~mgrigorov],

I am not sure what was the problem but for several days our PRs had Travis failures while the related logs were "null" so we did not know the reason.

About the points against GitHub Actions:
1) Personally I did not find that. Contrary, I've found that the GitHub actions executed faster than Travis.
2) For us the transition went smoothly and currently the CI works without any issue.
3) I agree this can be a problem. Do you know if there are plans at GitHub to extend the supported environments for ARM64?

During the Travis issues we were a bit frustrated because of the hanging PRs just before the planned release. So, maybe we acted too quickly without the proper discussions. Meanwhile as of GitHub Actions seems to be working properly and it currently does not support ARM64 I would suggest creating a new Travis config for ARB64 only.

If you have a strong opinion against GitHub Actions and you think switching back to Travis would be a good idea please start a discussion thread on the dev list (to not to make the same mistake we have had).

Hi [~gszadovszky] !

 

GitHub Actions had plans to add support for ARM64 with [https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/95] but now I see that they edited it and now it does not mention ARM anymore.

They've created [https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/169] a week ago but then immediately closed it.

Now [https://github.com/github/roadmap/projects/1] says nothing about ARM architecture :-/

 

The only two CIs which support non-x86_64 architectures I am aware of are TravisCI and DroneIO.

I like the idea to use TravisCI only for ARM64 until GitHub Actions adds support for it!
