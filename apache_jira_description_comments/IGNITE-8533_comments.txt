    IGNITE-8533 Fix timeout collision in Client Nodes test suite introduced by IGNITE-8085

----


PR https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/4030

TC: [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1315393&]

I can see one flaky test again there, remote node could not start: [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1315393&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_StartNodes&tab=buildResultsDiv#testNameId6814497542781613621]

not sure if this means that any longer timeout  would help (now we have 30sec)

 

Here is clean run on TC
