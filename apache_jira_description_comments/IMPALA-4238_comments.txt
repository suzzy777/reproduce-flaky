Let's see if we see this again. Catching the signal appears to be flakey, per the comment.

This happened again in a 2.10-based build.

This happened recently on asf/master, during an S3 build.

This happened recently on as/master during on exhaustive run on centos6.

For whatever reason, I've seen this happen on S3 occasionally as well. Might be worth disabling for S3 builds since these tests should be agnostic of the filesystem. I don't think they even run queries that use S3.

Still seems to be happening every few months. I'll investigate with low priority when I have a spare hour.

IMPALA-4238: make TestClientSsl more robust

This changes the test to wait until it is executing in the backend
before trying to cancel it. This should remove planning time as
a variable that might cause the test to be flaky (e.g. if planning
is slow on S3 because of the time taken to list files).

Also dump the /queries debug page when the assertion is hit to
aid debugging.
