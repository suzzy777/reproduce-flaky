In IMPALA-4868 we found TestRequestPoolService.testUpdatingConfigs got more flaky over time. We were not able to identify the root cause, but the code isn't changing so the test was disabled. We still need test coverage, so this JIRA tracks fixing and re-enabling this test in the future. It's fine if we can find a different way to get the same coverage.
