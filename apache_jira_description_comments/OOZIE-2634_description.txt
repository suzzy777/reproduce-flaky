If the callable queue is empty, and you run the queue dump command, the message says:
{noformat}
# oozie admin queuedump
[Server Queue Dump]:
Queue dump is null!
******************************************
[Server Uniqueness Map Dump]:
Uniqueness dump is null!
{noformat}

This message makes it sound like a bad thing, especially the exclamation mark.  We should change the message to something more neutral and helpful, like "The queue is empty" or something like that.
