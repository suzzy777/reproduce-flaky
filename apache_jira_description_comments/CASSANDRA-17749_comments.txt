I haven't been able to reproduce this because I believe it is very sensitive to timing.  We are forcing an update of the topology files [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/trunk/upgrade_tests/upgrade_through_versions_test.py#L511] but this is being written in place.  If the timer task in the ResourceWatcher for PropertyFileSnitch fires while this happens, it may read an empty file, causing this error.  But this isn't a problem other than the log entry, since the file will be read again with the correct information after it is written.  [Patch|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/tree/CASSANDRA-17749] to suppress the log, with [100 runs|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/544/workflows/954fcba1-be3a-47b5-8156-a1ce50afa4b4/jobs/6514].

The repeated run workers are finishing almost instantly with a {{Repeated dtest name hasn't been defined, exiting without running any test}} message. I think you have to run theÂ {{repeated_upgrade_dtest}} job, but {{j11_repeated_dtest}} was run instead. That job is only available in the workflow for j8 builds.

The repeated test jobs should probably fail on empty properties instead of succeed reporting the empty property. Otherwise, the only clue is the abnormally quick execution time. I'd try to fix that in another ticket.

Also, the value of {{REPEATED_UPGRADE_DTEST_NAME}} should be:
{code:java}
upgrade_tests/upgrade_through_versions_test.py::TestUpgrade_indev_4_0_x_To_indev_4_1_x::test_bootstrap_multidc
{code}
Instead of
{code:java}
upgrade_tests/upgrade_through_versions_test::TestUpgrade_indev_4_0_x_To_indev_4_1_x::test_bootstrap_multidc
{code}
I think the {{.py}} part on the file name is needed.

Oops, thanks for catching that.  I've started a proper run [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/546/workflows/c6b170e2-d90f-4714-9c74-a02575cf20d8/jobs/6516].

Suppressing the log message looks good to me, +1. I haven't been able to reproduce the failure on the unpatched branch either, at least [not with CircleCI|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1931/workflows/9066180e-a212-4073-8906-ebc406c0bea4].

bq.  I haven't been able to reproduce the failure

This isn't too surprising if my theory on the timer coinciding is correct.  Thanks for the assist and the review! Committed.
