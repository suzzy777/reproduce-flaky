+1 with recommendation to re-instate cleaning up DCs with RF 0 that's fine for commit time.

Tidied that up and the tests on commit.

Thanks Jon.

Hey [~jmckenzie] , seems like we got a flaky test here.

I see it was not in your run failing, but it failed for me with midres on Circle, then locally consistently and now I also saw it in Jenkins:

[https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/1054/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.cql3.validation.operations/AlterTest/testCreateAlterNetworkTopologyWithDefaults_cdc/]

Please check it

[~e.dimitrova] that is CASSANDRA-17496 which wasn't linked here but I've done it now.

Oh nice! Thank you [~brandon.williams], I just linked it also in Butler.
