This happens intermittently because:
1. RocksDB throws an exception if open is called on a store that's already open.
2. A new unit test was added in PR #327 that didn't close the store.
3. Other tests in this class use the same store directory (System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir")) and run concurrently. Any test that runs after the one in 2 above fails.

Even when we log the RocksDBException (fixed in pr #332), the actual exception message is malformed due to a bug in RocksDB: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/1688. This is fixed in the latest RocksDB version (verified with 5.8.0), so the messages should be more meaningful after an upgrade. Fixed stack trace says something like:
{code}
Caused by: org.rocksdb.RocksDBException: While lock file: /var/folders/1b/4nqqvf4s27sby0frjr0q5t_h0004hp/T/LOCK: No locks available
	at org.rocksdb.RocksDB.open(Native Method)
	at org.rocksdb.RocksDB.open(RocksDB.java:231)
	at org.apache.samza.storage.kv.RocksDbKeyValueStore$.openDB(RocksDbKeyValueStore.scala:70)
{code}
