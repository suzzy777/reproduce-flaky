I've disabled this test for now.

The test seems to run fine when launched from Intellij Idea but not from sbt. I am not sure why yet. It is something to do with Akka's Prop (actually Typesafe Config it uses) being not serializable under certain conditions. I am afraid that there may be two versions of Props/Config in the classpath (when running from sbt) though I havent figured out how. The serialization error causes the test to fail, every time. 

Some change in the last couple of months resulted in this side effect. Comparing spark 0.9 branch (where tests run fine), there is no difference in the Akka / Typesafe Config. The only difference is saw is in the version of sbt - 0.12.1 for branch 0.9, 0.13.2 for master.

So, still not solution, bumping this to post 1.0

Since this test was removed with SPARK-2805, safe to call this closed?
