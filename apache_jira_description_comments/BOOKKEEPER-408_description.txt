When I run the tests of BookKeeper, I found that the test running forever and cannot be finished. The log has the exception that is "junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Return code is not OK: -6". 

I thought this issuse might be come from the synchronization mechanism used by the BookieReadWriteTest.

for example in BookieReadWriteTest.TestReadWriteAsyncSingleClient()
1. when called the function lh.asyncAddEntry(entry.array(), this ,sync), the call back function is addComplete(int, LedgerHandle, long, Object)
2. we can see that in addComplete(..) the function will be fail when rc != BKException.Code.OK, and the x.counter++ will not be called never.
3. we assume that the function addComplete(..) is fail. so, in TestReadWriteAsyncSingleClient(), the while loop enter endless loop because sync.counter < numEntriesToWrite is right forever.
