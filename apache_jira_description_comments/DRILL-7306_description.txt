 The EVF framework is set up to return a "fast schema" empty batch with only schema as its first batch because, when the code was written, it seemed that's how we wanted operators to work. However, DRILL-7305 notes that many operators cannot handle empty batches.

Since the empty-batch bugs show that Drill does not, in fact, provide a "fast schema" batch, this ticket asks to disable the feature in the new scan framework. The feature is disabled with a config option; it can be re-enabled if ever it is needed.
