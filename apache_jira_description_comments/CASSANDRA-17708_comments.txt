I have forgotten about this ticket and hit it again while testing a patch.

org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.InternodeEncryptionEnforcementTest.testOutboundConnectionsAreInterruptedWhenAuthFails is flaky on trunk. Significantly on JDK8 and quite less with JDK11:

Saw this again while testing a trunk-based patch (or at least saw the failure from an issue duplicated by this one): https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/maedhroz/cassandra/670/workflows/6263f55f-e94b-4ef7-b4f3-975ba0c1fd64/jobs/5859/tests#failed-test-0

{noformat}
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<0> but was:<1>
	at org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.InternodeEncryptionEnforcementTest.lambda$testOutboundConnectionsAreRejectedWhenAuthFails$776879b6$1(InternodeEncryptionEnforcementTest.java:113)
{noformat}

This looks like a race condition and a bad assertion in the unit test. I'm looking at 
testOutboundFallbackOnSSLHandshakeFailure
which touches the same code. In that method, we enqueue a message, initiate the connection, and then just wait for the outbound connection to become connected. At the point where the connection state is changed (allowing outboundConnection.isConnected() to return true), there's no guarantee that the message that force the connection would actually be flushed. I think that for the purpose of this unit test, checking for pending messages is not actually needed, or should potentially be in another test.

Configured `RejectOutboundAuthenticator` only on instance 1 of the test cluster and waiting for the authentication error on instance 1 of the cluster fixed the flakiness of the test`InternodeEncryptionEnforcementTest.testOutboundConnectionsAreRejectedWhenAuthFails`.

Also, there is a race condition in the `AllowFirstAndRejectOtherOutboundAuthenticator`, fixing it removed the flakiness in the test `InternodeEncryptionEnforcementTest.testOutboundConnectionsAreInterruptedWhenAuthFails`.
