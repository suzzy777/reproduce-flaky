IMPALA-7837: Fix flakiness in test_resource_limits for release builds

test_resource_limits was failing in release build because the queries
used were finishing earlier than expected. This resulted in fragment
instances not being able to send enough updates to the coordinator in
order to hit the limits used for the tests. This patches adds a
deterministic sleep to the queries which gives enough time to the
coordinator to catch up on reports.

Testing:
Checked that tests passed on release builds.
