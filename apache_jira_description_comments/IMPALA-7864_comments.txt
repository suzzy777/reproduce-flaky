Hit this again, I suspect it somehow became more frequent. [~tlipcon] - Do you have time to look at this soon?

Saw this again.

IMPALA-7864: Deflake test_replan_limit

- Doubles the number of attempts to check for inconsistent metadata.
- Increases the chance of inconsistent metadata by adding more
  concurrent 'refresh'es (for bumping the table versions).

[~bharathv] saw this again, but on an ASAN build on Centos 7 (although the failure does not look ASAN related).

The failure is the same one that Tim mentioned above:

{code}
custom_cluster.test_local_catalog.TestLocalCatalogRetries.test_replan_limit (from pytest)

Error Message

AssertionError: Did not observe inconsistent metadata assert 0 > 0
Stacktrace
custom_cluster/test_local_catalog.py:241: in test_replan_limit
    assert seen > 0, "Did not observe inconsistent metadata"
E   AssertionError: Did not observe inconsistent metadata
E   assert 0 > 0
{code}

We could simply bump the number of retries but I think we should wait to see if there are more instances of this. I stared at the test for a while and I think it is very unlikely that we can run into this even after 200 attempts. 

[~bharathv] I ran into this again in a CORE ASAN test
{code:java}

[~attilaj] Ack, let me dig into this and get back!

[~vihangk1] can you take a look? We're still hitting this sometimes.

Sure, I can take a look at this.

Saw this again in a private build. Can't reproduce it in my local env.

This still seems to be happening every few months.

Hit this recently, would be good to deflake it.

Saw this again, in https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-from-scratch/16299/testReport/

IMPALA-7864: (Addendum) Deflake test_replan_limit by postponing catalog fetches

TestLocalCatalogRetries.test_replan_limit runs REFRESH and SELECT
queries concurrently on a table, and expects one of the query hits
inconsistent metadata.

This patch increases the chance of inconsistent metadata by injecting
a latency (500ms) before each catalog fetch. So it's more likely that a
request is fetching stale metadata. Also bump up the timeout of
thread.join() so we can try out all the attempts.

Test
 - Run test_replan_limit 1000 times without any error.
 - Run all tests of TestLocalCatalogRetries 100 times without any error.
