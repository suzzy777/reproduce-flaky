Before diving into debugging the issue why the OperatorEvent was lost please read through https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21996 which tried to address this exact issue.

[~dwysakowicz] Right, FLINK-21996 tries to address the issue where losing an OperatorEvent could lead to inconsistent state. And it suggests that "Intermediate RPC messages from JM to TM can get dropped" due to temporary connection failure.

It is not surprising that connection could be lost temporarily in Azure. I guess my suggestion is, if we could figure out the exact reason why this connection failure is happening at this rate (1+ failure per day in Azure pipeline), maybe we could increase number of RPC retries in our test setup to significantly reduce the flakiness of this test.
