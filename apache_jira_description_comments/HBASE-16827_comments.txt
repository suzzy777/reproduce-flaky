Have you run all backup / restore tests ?

Yes


[~stack]:
Is there other change you want to see for Backup.proto ?

That seems good. Change the 'required' to 'optional'. Yesterday Matteo and I ran into an issue where a proto had a required and when the proto was originally written, it made total sense the field be required but then a year on, it has become an obstacle to evolving the type.

v2 addresses other RB comments. cc:[~tedyu]

{code}
 message BackupManifest {
-  required string version = 1;
-  required string backup_id = 2;
-  required BackupType type = 3;
+  //optional string version = 1;
+  //optional string backup_id = 2;
+  //optional BackupType type = 3;
{code}
Please drop commented out fields.

There is one hunk in BackupManifest.java which doesn't apply cleanly.

See if you get the following test failure:

Failed tests:
  TestIncrementalBackup.TestIncBackupRestore:196
Expected: <198>
     but: was <99>

Duplicate post due to poor connection.

The test is flaky? It passes locally. I will take a look. 

Yes, it passed 3 times then failed.

v3. This is maximum we can get from .poto optimization w/o significant code refactoring.

Please update the description with actual changes.

Meanwhile I am running backup tests locally.

v5. Removed BackupManifest completely from .proto definition.
