Patch has two parts. Firstly, it hooks ZookeeperClient into the bookkeeper client. This is all very straightforward.

Secondly, I added a thread in BookKeeperClusterTestCase, which kills the clients zookeeper session every 1 second. Tests run with this, and mostly pass, but there's some flakiness. All tests should succeed with this, but I think these are different fixes. One thing that is broken is that #close fails if it gets a MetadataVersionException. This is wrong. It should only fail if assumptions have changed. I think BOOKKEEPER-795 should fix this. Other tests fail because timeouts are too short, afaics. Having to retry metadata operations takes more time.

[~ikelly] are the failed test cases flaky due to zookeeper session expires?

Yes, I think it is mostly timeouts of the tests since they take longer. Perhaps the session expirer in the tests is too aggresive. It's cancelling the client session every 1 second. I'll change it to 5.

[~ikelly] Would it make sense to keep the old ZK session if it's still valid, instead of creating a new one each time the GC runs?

Patch doesn't apply cleanly to me.

the recreation happens only when zookeeper session expired. if the zookeeper session is expired, it isn't valid. so I don't see a point to keep the old session.

My understanding is that the bookie GC is recreating a new ZK session for each run, and closing that session when GC is done.

I don't think it closes zookeeper session. could you point me the code?

I don't think it closes zookeeper session. could you point me the code?

attach a patch to make bookkeeper use o.a.b.z.ZooKeeperClient.

- change ZooKeeperClient to use builder and add stats support
- change zookeeper in bookkeeper to use ZooKeeperClient.

Hmm, is the test failure legitimate?
