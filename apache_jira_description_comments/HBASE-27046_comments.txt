Heya [~zhangduo], the patch for this change enabled TestQuotaThrottle, which is again failing quite reliably. It actually enabled two tests, neither of which are clearly related to the stated change in this issue's title. Any comments here? I think we should re-disable TestQuotaThrottle, if not both of them. Thanks.

On branch-2, TestClusterQuotaThrottle will produce a bunch of error logs as it reset the EnvironmentEdge, which make the filenum related logic in AbstractFSWAL broken. In this way, our flaky test job can not finish properly so I disabled it.

After fixing the AbstractFSWAL issue, I think it can quit normally, so even if it is still flaky, we will add it to the flaky list, then it will not fail our pre commit build, and we can check the flaky test job output to find out the root cause and finally make it stable.

So the problem for now, is it will fail the pre commit, but not the nightly jobs, so it is still not in the flaky list?

For me, I prefer we do not ignore any UTs, just let it go into the flaky tests list and finally get fixed.

Thanks.

Looked at the flaky dashboard, TestQuotaThrottle has been included in the flaky list so it will not fail the pre commit job now.

Okay, I now understand that this was an intentional change -- good. I agree that we should avoid the {{@Ignore}} annotation if we can avoid it.

In the specific case of TestQuotaThrottle, during my local runs while attempting to bisect to the introduction of the failure, I noticed that this test is not killed properly by the HBaseClassTestRule. I think that maybe there's a bug in there where throttling is not marking a thread as a deamon, but I have not investigated it in depth.

Thanks!

I resolved HBASE-27087 for now by adding an @Ignore to the test . Sorry, but we need clean tests for RCs. I put a comment in the file referring to the two relevant JIRAs. 

HBASE-27243 to fix the test
