I couldn't reproduce this locally. In the logs there's also the following line failing to write into authorization file
{quote}
Error saving notebook authorization file: No such file or directory
{quote}
which is related to those tests as well. so the quesion is why wouldn't it be able to write (considering usage of personal travis account), since there's check for the case of file doesn't exist [here|https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/NotebookAuthorization.java#L146]

    [ZEPPELIN-2155] Flaky test: NotebookTest -   NotebookTest.testPublicPrivateNewNote:11…

    ### What is this PR for?
    Will do this in two parts, this one is easy. Just give some static name to note say "1111" so it is always the first note.
    
    So, this fixes `NotebookTest.testPublicPrivateNewNote:1173 expected:<2C[B7YJQ16]> but was:<2C[A45Z6X7]>`
    
    ### What type of PR is it?

    ### How should this be tested?
    CI should not fail with  `NotebookTest.testPublicPrivateNewNote:1173 expected:<2C[B7YJQ16]> but was:<2C[A45Z6X7]>`

    Test passed https://travis-ci.org/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin/builds/206156551
    PR build status is yellow, because ASF Jenkins is unusually busy today. 
    Considering Jenkins job queue length, it'll take a day to build status become green.
    
    So without waiting Jenkins, i'll merge this PR to master and branch-0.7 as a hotfix.
