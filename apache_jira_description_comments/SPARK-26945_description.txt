From the test code, it seems like the `shmutil.rmtree` function is trying to delete a directory, but there's likely another thread adding entries to a directory, so when it gets to `os.rmdir(path)` it blows up. I think the test (and other streaming tests) should call `q.awaitTermination` after `q.stop`, before going on. I'll file a separate jira.
