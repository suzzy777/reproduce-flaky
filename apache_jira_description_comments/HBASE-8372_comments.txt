Will fix typos. Currently running full suites against hadoop1 and hadoop2.  (ran isolated tests prior to posting test).

bq. If I understand this correctly, this also removes the support for substitutions from data coming from HTD/HCD configuration and metadata...

This has been the case since this method was added (HBASE-5335, to support dynamic schema change).  I haven't changed the semantics of get (all the HTC, HCD's values added using maps aren't affected -- they couldn't support this either).

Since this is "semantics preserving", mind if I TODO this with a follow on jira?  I primarily care about resolving HBASE-8347.

Or I could make it correct but it would be quite slow, so I'd put warnings on it.

Separate JIRA works, +1 assuming typos are fixed/tests pass

When mutableConf is not null, can we get rid of the list of ImmutableConfigMap's ?
This consolidation can be achieved upon the first call to set().

bq. When mutableConf is not null, can we get rid of the list of ImmutableConfigMap's ?
bq. This consolidation can be achieved upon the first call to set().

[~tedyu@apache.org], I don't that is correct unless we go through and copy all the values from the parents.  Doing that seems to negate the purpose of having the CompoundConfiguariton.  We also would lose the ability to change a parent configuration under this config and have the change visible to CompoundConfiguration (I believe there the original comments have something about this).  

Looks like hadoop1 passed here. In my hadoop2 runs the tests I was concerned about pass (and we have a few failures from the usual hadoop2 flakies).

bq. We also would lose the ability to change a parent configuration under this config and have the change visible to CompoundConfiguration
Can you elaborate the above a little bit more ?
If the list of ImmutableConfigMap's are consolidated into mutableConf, we're free to change any config entry in mutableConf, right ?

The class's javadoc describes intended semantics.  See the "For clarity" section:

{code}
/**
 * Do a shallow merge of multiple KV configuration pools. This is a very useful
 * utility class to easily add per-object configurations in addition to wider
 * scope settings. This is different from Configuration.addResource()
 * functionality, which performs a deep merge and mutates the common data
 * structure.
 * <p>
 * The iterator on CompoundConfiguration is unmodifiable. Obtaining iterator is an expensive
 * operation.
 * <p>
 * For clarity: the shallow merge allows the user to mutate either of the
 * configuration objects and have changes reflected everywhere. In contrast to a
 * deep merge, that requires you to explicitly know all applicable copies to
 * propagate changes.
 * 
 * WARNING: The values set in the CompoundConfiguration are do not handle Property variable
 * substitution.  However, if they are set in the underlying configuration substitutions are
 * done. 
 */
{code}

v2 fixees typos, fixes "new Configuration(false)" so it actually creates an empty config, and adds test that demonstrates that adding to a parent config propagates and is visible to the CompoundConfig that contains it.

What happens if compoundConf.set("a", "b") gets called first followed by compoundConf.addStringMap() where one of the entries is also keyed on "a" ?
The entry from the StringMap should override the tuple ("a", "b") from the set() call, right ?

nice catch ted.  since this never happens in the code currently, I've added a check that throws an exception if that occurs.  Will let tests run and if clean I plan on committing.

In my opinion, the places where UnsupportedOperationException is added should be good candidates for merging the ImmutableConfigMap's.
For patch v3, we would face scenario where dynamic config is no longer supported after one call to set() method. I don't think this is desirable.

I think the unit tests passing show that this is currently a speculative scenario.  If the the scenario is encountered a reasonable warning is provided.

In a long running cluster, we should anticipate mixture of calls to set() and addXXX(). We should support them.

If UnsupportedOperationException is thrown, code utilizing CompoundConfiguration wouldn't be able to recover.

Currently, there are none of these hypothetical edits in our unit tests -- if the did exist today, any attempts would have failed.  This patch only widens the possible places edits can be done but does not introduce the situations you mention.  If can happen somewhere, this means our unit tests are insufficient, and we should add coverage.

I think it would be appropriate to add that functionality if/when we need it.  If you want me to add it now, please provide a scenario where this problem can happen today.  If a reasonable scenario is described, I'll file a follow-on-jira to add the unit tests to cover this.  

  


Consider the scenario described by HBASE-8347. Here is the call stack:

SecureBulkLoadEndpoint retrieves CompoundConfiguration from CoprocessorEnvironment. This CompoundConfiguration is shared with the underlying HRegion.
After CompoundConfiguration.setClass() call, this CompoundConfiguration becomes mutable.
Our expectation would be for the underlying HRegion to continue supporting dynamic config *and* for SecureBulkLoadEndpoint to see the new config entries.

The specific example great -- please do this in the future!  When this is concrete it is much easier to act upon.

My interpretation of mutability for CompoundConfiguration is that once mutableConf is materialized, we can deep merge existing list of ImmutableConfigMap into mutableConf.
Subsequent calls to addXXX() would merge the config entries of the method parameter into mutableConf.
This way, we have good control of memory footprint for CompoundConfiguration instances in long running cluster.

If we are not arguing about correctness I'd like to commit this and file a follow on for perf concerns. 

I'm not sure I buy your argument. It sounds like we potentially break semantics and use more mem; both seem undesirable. If we do what you suggest we then end up copying the data everywhere instead of sharing (ex: htabledescription[1][2][3] provides an sharable shallow copy of the map map, in every region).  If we did what you suggest, we'd now have copy of each value into a new mutableConf (an extra hash table entry per prop per region as opposed to a single pointer to a singlethe htd table), and we lose the ability to propagate changes to the added map without hunting down every instance present.  (if we change the table map, we'd need to hunt all instances down to propagate htd changes to each regions conf.)

bq. we'd now have copy of each value into a new mutableConf
Can you clarify the meaning of 'a new mutableConf' ? Once mutableConf is materialized inside CompoundConfiguration, the list of ImmutableConfigMap's are no longer needed (after merging them into mutableConf).

In patch v5, each time freezeMutableConf() is called, ImmutableConfWrapper would keep a reference to mutableConf. This leads to more memory consumption.

bq. Can you clarify the meaning of 'a new mutableConf' ? Once mutableConf is materialized inside CompoundConfiguration, the list of ImmutableConfigMap's are no longer needed.

I believe this is false.  Let me spend the time to explicitly illustrate the different approaches with a pseudo code unit test.  

{code}
Conf hbase = <from hbase-site.xml/hbasedefault.xml>. 
Conf htd = <from htabledescription of table t>
Conf hri = <from hregioninfo of region r in table t>
Conf compound = new CompoundConfiguration;
compound.add(hbase);
compound.add(htd);
compound.add(hri);

compound.set("key", "value");
assertEquals("value", compound.get("key")); // passes

Map<..> map = <new map that doesn't overlap any values>; 
compound.add(map); // trigger freeze

hbase.set("hbasekey", "hbasevalue");
assertEquals("hbasevalue", compound.get("hbasekey")); // should pass.  If the triggered freeze did deep copy, it would fail because there is no reference to the higher level's table
hri.setProp("...", "blah");
assertEquals("blah", compound.get("...")); // should pass.  If the triggered freeze did deep copy, it would fail because there is no reference to the higher level's table
{code}

If we did a deep copy, and eliminated the list of ImmutableConfigMaps, we'd have a copy of each configuration value, essentially taking up an entry per property in each of the levels instead of a single pointer to the previous level's map.  This is a common pattern used to manage hierarchical scope.

Using example is always the best way to understand assumptions.
bq. hbase.set("hbasekey", "hbasevalue");
I am not sure the above usage is supported currently - namely, retrieval of new key/value after the add() call.
Looking at current TestCompoundConfiguration:
{code}
    CompoundConfiguration compoundConf = new CompoundConfiguration()
        .add(baseConf)
        .add(conf);
{code}
There is no set() call after the add() calls.

In your example above, I think the correct way of overriding key with value after the add(hri) call is made should be using another add() call. This is because the order of adding hbase, htd and hri to the compound is significant. When htd and hri contain entries with same key but different values, I do not expect htd.set(key, newValue) would be effective.

So wait, you've asked me to deal with the case where add is called after set, and I've wrote code making it unsupported.  You pointed out a counter example where that was insufficient, and I added code and unit tests that address that.  

Now you are saying the usage of set after an add is unsupported?  Please make up your mind. 

*Please provide unit test psuedo-code to demonstrate the semantics you want in a follow-jira.*

bq. There is no set() call after the add() calls.

In your previous counterexample, with the TestSecureLoadInc* there obviously is an {{add}} after a {{set}}.  The code in v5 handles that as well as the case where {{set}} is called after an {{add}}.  The unit tests define the semantics to be that of a standard hierarchically scoped symbol table as described in the class's javadoc.  Let me refer to this, again:
{code}
 * For clarity: the shallow merge allows the user to mutate either of the
 * configuration objects and have changes reflected everywhere. In contrast to a
 * deep merge, that requires you to explicitly know all applicable copies to
 * propagate changes.
{code}

bq. In your example above, I think the correct way of overriding key with value after the add(hri) call is made should be using another add() call. This is because the order of adding hbase, htd and hri to the compound is significant. When htd and hri contain entries with same key but different values, I do not expect htd.set(key, newValue) would be effective.

I noted that the {{Map<...> map}} I've added after the set doesn't have any overlapping keys.  Thus if I set hbasekey using the hbase conf, it should by the javadoc propagate up to the compoind's get call.  The unit tests I added to the code show this.  If I were to add another {{set("hbasekey",..)}} at the htd level, the htd's hbasekey value would be returned, overriding the hbase level. 

*Please be explicit -- provide an example in psuedo-code instead of vague prose.  I don't have the time to infer or to make your own arguments for you.*  

If the tests comeback clean, I intend in committing this this afternoon.



bq. If we are not arguing about correctness I'd like to commit this and file a follow on for perf concerns.
I agree with the above.

bq. If the tests comeback clean
I think patch v5 passed QA run.

Thanks for your patience, Jon.

+1 from me.

Thanks for the reviews sergey and ted.  Committed to trunk and 0.95

[~tedyu@apache.org] please file the follow-on with the perf concern you have because I don't quite understand it currently.
