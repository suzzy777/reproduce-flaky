    I think there is a better way to do this. Picking a new port for each test seems to be a workaround for failing to clean up the resources utilized by a failing test. It would be better if we cleaned up properly after a test execution. 
    
    Since this is the method we used to fix the test in another branch I think it is up to the discretion of the committers, but it would be nice to not leak any resources from our tests.

    I got your point @afine, however I'm still under the impression that the root cause is that tests are running in parallel and multiple instances of Zookeeper are trying to run. I've seen "Address already in use exception" as an example of this.
    
    I also have a feeling that in some rare cases tests are trying to use the same instance in parallel and modifying each other's state.

    @anmolnar my understanding was that tests for branch-3.4 do not run in parallel. Let me know if I'm incorrect.

    @afine Here is the command I've extracted from build logs showing that junit runs tests on 8 threads:
    `[ZooKeeper_branch34_jdk8] $ ant -Dtest.output=yes -Dtest.junit.threads=8 -Dtest.junit.output.format=xml -Djavac.target=1.8 clean test-core-java`
    
    Please let me know if I need to check something else too.

    @anmolnar You are correct that the command is executed with argument that would allow the tests to run in parallel but if you take a look at the build.xml on branch-3.4 it looks like the code to use "test.junit.threads" is not there. I believe the JIRA to add this was https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2183 which shows the change only touched 3.5 and master.

    @afine Do you think it's better to cancel this change? Affected tests have been running fine for a couple of builds.

    @anmolnar It would be great to have a complete understanding of the root problem. Can you try changing the patch to cleanup after each test to see what happens?
