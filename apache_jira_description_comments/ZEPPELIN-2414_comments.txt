After reading the code of SparkInterprter, I found two lines of code in SparkInterprter.open() are related to this problem.
{quote}
// set classloader for scala compiler
    settings.explicitParentLoader_$eq(new Some<ClassLoader>(Thread.currentThread()
        .getContextClassLoader()));
...
Utils.invokeMethod(intp, "setContextClassLoader");
{quote}
SparkInterprter.open() is executed by a thead in SchedulerFactory.executor: ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.

After the first SparkInterprter.open() is executed, this thread's contextClassLoader is set to be SparkInterprter.interpreter.intp._classloader: TranslatingClassLoader. The original contextClassLoader is the parent of SparkInterprter.interpreter.intp._classloader.

When the second SparkInterprter.open() is executed in the same thread, the second SparkInterprter.interpreter.intp._classloader becomes this thread's contextClassLoader. The first _classloader is referenced by the second _classloader as parent classloader.

So none of the created _classloader will be recycled by JVM GC.

[~moon], I've created a patch and tested it in my own environment. If this patch is OK, may I be the assignee of this issue.

Thanks for working on this issue and the patch.

    Thanks @hammertank for the contribution.
    
    What do you think wrap interpreter using [ClassLoaderInterpreter](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/ClassloaderInterpreter.java) instead of modifying individual interpreter?
    
    Interpreter is being instantiated from [RemoteInterpreterServer](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/branch-0.6/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/remote/RemoteInterpreterServer.java#L166), so this is place where ClassLoaderInterpreter can wrap Interpreter. Like [Interpreter factory does](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/branch-0.6/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/InterpreterFactory.java#L894)



Github user hammertank commented on the issue:

    @Leemoonsoo Changed the code as you suggested. But I have no idea how to write a testcase to validate the modification.

    @Leemoonsoo re-commit as required. Please review again. 
    Jenkins did not get the final travis-ci results successfully. Is there a way to trigger Jenkins to fetch again without a push?


Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    Found "ClassNotFoundException" after applying this fix. This is caused by SparkContext using the first TranslatingClassLoader to deserialize TaskResult.  
    Sorry to say that I haven't figure out a solution yet. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
