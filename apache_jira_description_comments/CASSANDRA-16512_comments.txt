I didn't manage to reproduce it locally and in private multiplexer but code inspection shows me that we can hit the same issue as in CASSANDRA-16443.

[~jlewandowski], is it possible to try [the patch |https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commit/fa5b947823edd66d19e9ef8e33311c1f91e96966] in your environment to confirm the fix?

[~blerer], may I ask you for review as you fixed the other one? Thank you in advance :)

j11 unit tests didn't run #justfyi

+1 if everything looks good with the j11 unit tests

Circle CI was crashing on Friday so it seems as a result Java 11 didn't have a run.


 Clean CI [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/698/workflows/fb5f621b-aacd-41a2-abcf-512a811dcd6d/jobs/3859/parallel-runs/1]
 Patch committed [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/0a4b997337aafcc81396d27ac5de2a682283152f]. I see Jacek also approved the patch on GitHub. Thank you all
