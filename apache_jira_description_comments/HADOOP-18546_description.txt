turn off the prune of in progress reads in ReadBufferManager::purgeBuffersForStream

this will ensure active prefetches for a closed stream complete. they wiill then get to the completed list and hang around until evicted by timeout, but at least prefetching will be safe.

When backporting
* include the followup test fix patch
* include HADOOP-18577.
