As mentioned on SOLR-15781, the v2 API currently has an experimental designation, and the community has expressed an interest in using this period to update our v2 endpoints to be more REST-ful and consistent.  The current plan is to follow the specific changes laid out in [this spreadsheet|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAoBBFPpSiT8mJmgNZKkZAPwfCfPvlc08m5jz3fQBpA/edit?usp=sharing], though of course nothing there is set in stone and there are still warts to be worked out.

While we're touching the code for these endpoints, we should also convert them to JAX-RS framework definitions.  (This was initially tracked as a separate effort - see SOLR-16370 - but the edit that were required ended up overlapping so significantly with the "cosmetic" improvements here that in practice it almost always makes sense to do the two together.)

This ticket plans to tackle making the changes required for Solr's "core" APIs, as described in the spreadsheet above.  ("Core" is a pretty bad descriptor but I'm not sure what name to attach to this group.  I have in my head all of the Solr core/collection APIs that involve adding or operating on documents, e.g. {{/select}}, {{/update}}, {{/tag}}, etc.)

Some helpful links related to these changes these changes. Should help get any interested newcomers started!
