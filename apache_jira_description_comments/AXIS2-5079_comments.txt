What I usually do is drop axis2.war file into webapps directory and once it deployed stop the server and delete axis2.war file so that exploded Axis2 directory remains in the wapapps directory BTW I don't see any issue with your approach if you extract axis2.war correctly. 

I haven't test this for 1.5.5 but just tested for 1.6.0 version on both Linux and windows also for Tomcat 6 and 7 but didn't encounter any such issue. please see my log entries below. Can you try with Axis2 1.6.0 version , my guess is this is something related to your configuration.

I think that the issue is that the change in r1064552 (which is a fix to the parent-last class loading stuff) is missing on the 1.5 branch. However, this change was included in 1.6.0. Looking at the code, I think it's impossible to get the ClassCastException with 1.6.0. Are you sure that you are using the official release and not one of the earlier release candidates?

Integrated in axis2-1.5 #151 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/axis2-1.5/151/])
    AXIS2-5079: Merged r1064552 to the 1.5 branch.

I verified that this works in 1.6.  

I see some code merged into the 1_5 branch....are we going to release a new 1.5.x release?  Not that it matter to me. 

The other question is whether I should close this issue?

Can you test with 1.5.6-SNAPSHOT? Thanks.

Andreas, I tested using the https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/axis2/axis2/1.5.6-SNAPSHOT/axis2-1.5.6-20110626.003901-5.jar (i replaced the axis2-kernel-1.5.5 jar file with this), and things seem to now work. Note that the JAR file seems to be more than 2X larger than the 1.5.5 jar file.  

The only thing now that I see is flakiness described in JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS2-4541 which I am trying to hunt down.  The problems described in the JIRA does not appear to happen in Axis2 1.6.  If you have any ideas where the fix is, it would be greatly appreciated.
