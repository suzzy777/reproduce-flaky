   @hachikuji Here's the PR with two commits: one for the autoboxing/unboxing cleanup and the other for the close of the connection when an authentication session expires.  You had originally suggested invoking `selector.close(channel.id)` but I committed `close(channel.id)` instead because that invokes `selector.close()` but also performs additional cleanup associated with the termination of a connection.
