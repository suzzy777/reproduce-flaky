Hello [~rvaleti],

ZooKeeper 3.4 is not supported by the community anymore, please upgrade to the latest 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7 version to have community support.

(the ZooKeeper client code also got many improvements in more recent releases)

Hi [~symat], Sure, I will try this against >=3.5 and update the Jira tomorrow.

High level, looked at 3.5/6/7 branches and the code path hasn't changed (ClientCnxn.java). I'm confident that this bug exists there as well. Once I test against >=3.5, I will provide a patch to fix this.

[~symat]


I was able to reproduce the same on 3.5 branch by inducing a 1 second delay right before Subject.doAs() in SecurityUtils#createSaslClient() method.

The bug - ZK client starts connection timer much ahead (which includes Sasl client creation) of sending a connection request to ZK Server and falsely assuming that it's timing out on ZK server and goes for retries.

Fix: ZK client should start the connection timer right before sending a connection request to ZK server.

I will provide a patch for this on 3.5 first and then we can port it to relevant branches.

Thank you [~rvaleti] for working on the issue!!

Please make sure to create the patch first on the master branch (if the problem exists there too). Usually we are making / reviewing bugfixes first on master, then backporting it to the older active branches (which currently are branch-3.7, branch-3.6 and branch-3.5).

Thank you!

Thanks [~symat], I raised a separate PR for master [https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/1685] as suggested. Please review and merge.
