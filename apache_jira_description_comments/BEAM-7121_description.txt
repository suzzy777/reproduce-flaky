Passing deterministic=true to proto's [SerializeToString|https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/60b66a119d17f0a2a595a231bea87cd4f4cf2689/python/google/protobuf/message.py#L189-L204] will result in deterministic encoding of maps in protos. This can be used to provide a deterministic version of ProtoCoder.

This would allow protos to be used as a key for grouping by key.
