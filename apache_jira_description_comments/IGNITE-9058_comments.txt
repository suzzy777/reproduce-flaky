    change tomcat version

----


Hi, [~dpavlov]!

I changed tomcat version in pom and information about version in license files.

Also I made RunAll on TC and builded fabric and prerelease from Devnotes and didn't find any problems.

Could you look at this patch, please?

Merged to master. [~ivanan.fed] thank you for contribution.

I appologize, I've mentioned wrong version. Could we update to higher wersion, e.g. https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat/9.0.10

[~ivanan.fed] could you please create second PR for this update, because I've already merged previous before noticing that.

I've checked all tests, and it seems it is rare flaky failures.
