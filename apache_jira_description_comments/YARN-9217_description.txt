Nodemanager will not start

1. If Autodiscovery is enabled:
 * If nvidia-smi path is misconfigured or the file does not exist.
 * There is 0 GPU found
 * If the file exists but it is not pointing to an nvidia-smi
 * if the binary is ok but there is an IOException

2. If the manually configured GPU devices are misconfigured
 * Any index:minor number format failure will cause a problem
 * 0 configured device will cause a problem
 * NumberFormatException is not handled

It would be a better option to add warnings about the configuration, set 0 available GPUs and let the node work and run non-gpu jobs.
