From my local runs, I noticed that it only happens when `enableBootstrapSourceClean=true`. Need to look into how we generate bootstrap index and source data for the test. It would be better if we can fix the generation (using a fixed seed) across runs.

For now, I am diabling the test [https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5930]

But we need to look into how we are constructing the clean metadata for test table.
