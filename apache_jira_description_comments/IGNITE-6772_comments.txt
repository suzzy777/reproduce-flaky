    IGNITE-6772: SQL exception messages became more informative.

[~vozerov], [~ptupitsyn], I made a small fix for this problem, please review. [TC tests|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewQueued.html?itemId=1030457] are OK except some flaky tests in Queries2 suite and .NET tests which depends on the old error messages. [~ptupitsyn], I think we need to fix these .NET tests.

[~rkondakov] you are right, .NET tests should be fixed, please go ahead.

[~vozerov], [~ptupitsyn], TC run is ok, please review.

[~rkondakov],
* {{JdbcResultSet}}: why change to {{cls.getSimpleName().toLowerCase()}}? Should we also include source class which we tried to convert?
* {{IgniteH2Indexing}}: I would include both the message and the query text, like {{Failed to parse query [error=..., query=...]}}.

[~ptupitsyn], 
*  This made for an uniformity error messages between different types of JDBC drivers. JDBC and JDBC2 drivers used to return {{Value is an not instance of " + cls.getName()}} in case of types mismatch. JDBC Thin driver returns {{Cannot convert to URL/boolean/float... etc.}} where type is hardcoded. It is useful not only for users but also for testing purposes.  I'm not sure if we need to add a source class to the message because this problem is relevant only for JDBC and JDBC2 drivers which are going to be deprecated as far as I know. Thin driver {{ResultSet}} includes value (but not value class) in the error message. E.g. {{"Cannot convert to float: " + val}}. From my point of view it should be enough for debugging reasons.
* Query text is already included into the exception's message sent from the parsing engine: {{Column "WRONG" not found; SQL statement: select wrong from test \[42122-195\]}}. If we also include it here, query will be dublicated in the same message.

Ok, looks good to me then. [~vozerov] please have a look as well.
