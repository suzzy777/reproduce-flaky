One of the test failures  in https://jenkins.impala.io/job/gerrit-verify-dryrun/2983/consoleFull was:
{code}
14:03:27 ]     assert actual_time_s <= time_limit_s, (
14:03:27 ] E   AssertionError: It took 31.9429180622 seconds to execute the query. Time limit is 30 seconds.
14:03:27 ] E   assert 31.942918062210083 <= 30
{code}
This should not be related to the tested change, so I think that the test is flaky.
