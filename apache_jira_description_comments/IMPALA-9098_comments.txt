I'm going to see if I can repro, and if not I'll dig otu the profile from the failed job and see if that has any clues.

No luck reproducing this.

I found a good and bad instance of the same query. It looks like it produced at least 16 rows, but only 10 rows were returned by the client. Suspiciously, on this run BATCH_SIZE=10.

I have a theory that this is actually an Impyla bug triggered by us returning 0 rows in some cases: https://github.com/cloudera/impyla/issues/369

Add query id debugging for HS2

As part of debugging IMPALA-9098, I realised we don't print the query ID
for HS2 queries, which makes it harder finding queries in the logs.

This pulls the query ID out of the Impyla handle and prints it in
the expected form (I used the same logic as in impala shell).
