Occasionally, I see different errors around {{_jvm}}, {{_wrapped}} and {{_jsparkSession}} popping out in data tests

The set of errors is not always the same, so it indicates so issues with type checker.

I am going to add {{casts}} and / or annotations for these lines, so we don't get flaky tests.
