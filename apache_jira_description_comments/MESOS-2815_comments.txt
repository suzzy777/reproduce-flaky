Investigating: there may be a race between starting the scheduler driver and awaiting offers. Some refactoring of the fetcher cache test code should prevent this. 

Since all other fetcher cache tests reuse this code, they should also be affected. But this does not seem to be a non-test-code bug.

The linked review has been committed.
[~bernd-mesos], is there anything left to do before we can close this/these JIRAs?

    Fixed the race between EXPECT_CALL(resourceOffers, _) and
    driver.start() in fetcher_cache_tests.cpp.
