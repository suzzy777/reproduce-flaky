IMPALA-8926, IMPALA-8957: Fix result spooling flaky tests

TestResultSpooling::_test_full_queue was flaky because there was a race
condition in the test where the result spooling queue would not fill up
quickly enough. The original way around this was to sleep for a fixed
amount of time in hope that the queue would fill up by the time the
thread woke up. The new approach periodically searches the runtime
profile for specific patterns that indicate the queue is full.

TestFetchAndSpooling.test_rows_sent_counters was flaky because the
RowsSentRate can be 0 if the results are spooled fast enough (because
the time spent spooling results is 0). The fix is to use the DEBUG_ACTION
BPRS_BEFORE_ADD_BATCH to introduce a delay when spooling results, so that
the RowsSentRate is guaranteed to be non-zero.

TestFetch.test_rows_sent_counters was flaky because ClientFetchWaitTimer
can be 0 if the Coordinator does not end up waiting any time for results
to be fetched. The fix is to wait until the query has 'FINISHED'
(results are available to fetch) and then sleep so that the
ClientFetchWaitTimer is a non-zero value.

Cleaned up a few other tests as well.

Testing:
* Looped both tests for a few hours without failure

Hi [~stakiar], just hit another failure in a build with the latest commit for this JIRA. Can you please take a look ?

Yeah, both the {{test_full_queue}} tests are still pretty flaky :(. Still trying to understand why.

Bumping priority as a number of regular regression builds are affected. May be worth considering disabling the test to unbreak the build for now.

IMPALA-8926, IMPALA-8989: Fix flaky result spooling tests

Disable the tests TestResultSpooling::test_full_queue(_large_fetch)
until we figure out why they are flaky.

Replace the sleep in TestAdmissionController::test_release_backend with
assert_eventually to reduce flakiness.
