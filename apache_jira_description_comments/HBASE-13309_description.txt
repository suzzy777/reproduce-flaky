while playing with client timeouts, I hit lots of flakys in HBaseFsck. the cause was just an EnvironmentEdge.inject() not followed by a reset().

looks like TestFsUtils and TestHRegion are the only other two that have a missing reset(). all the other tests using inject() seems to be written properly.
