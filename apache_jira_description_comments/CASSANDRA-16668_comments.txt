Here are 10K runs of {{SEPExecutorTest}} with the patch, using the [CircleCI multiplexer|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/doc/source/development/testing.rst#circleci]:
 * [j8-j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/457/workflows/cb5b1d27-75d4-4b3a-814c-04454fb4f4ef/jobs/4017]

It seems that {{changingMaxWorkersMeetsConcurrencyGoalsTest}} happily survives the three 10K runs, but there are some uncommon failures on {{shutdownTest}}:
 * [j8-j8 runner 62 iteration 49|https://4017-85817267-gh.circle-artifacts.com/62/stdout/fails/049/testsome-org.apache.cassandra.concurrent.SEPExecutorTest.txt]
 * [j8-j11 runner 73 iteration 9|https://4015-85817267-gh.circle-artifacts.com/73/stdout/fails/009/testsome-org.apache.cassandra.concurrent.SEPExecutorTest.txt]
 * [j11-j11 runner 68 iteration 51|https://4013-85817267-gh.circle-artifacts.com/68/stdout/fails/051/testsome-org.apache.cassandra.concurrent.SEPExecutorTest.txt]

Not sure whether that is related or an independent failure.

I think that failure is probably unrelated because we saw similar failures for shutdownTest before this patch here [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/441/workflows/bcf154ff-0b56-48ed-9f82-6b3e395f53ed/jobs/3880/tests#failed-test-0]

Btw, I've also written a new unit test to catch this bug in the future: [https://github.com/mfleming/cassandra/commit/b4f43608c9a8db23a622608804d95629616a66da] 

+1 from me on 071516d29e41da9924af24e8002822d3c6af0e01 and b4f43608c9a8db23a622608804d95629616a66da . Thanks so much for fixing it and updating the tests. 

I think it fixes the issue you found, and I don't think it is possible to create an unbounded number of threads in the shared pool by frequently calling {{setMaximumPoolSize}} as it only calls schedule if there are no spinning threads, and tries to satisfy itself for work from the parked/spinning pools first.

I'm slightly concerned about the fixed duration sleep() in the new test given how much variability there is in CI infrastructure timing. Ideally the test would verify that all of the SEPWorkers were parked (and none spinning), but there's not any straightforward way I can see to do that without refactoring. Worst case is the test doesn't always cover the all-SEPWorkers parked case every time, but seems unlikely to fail and create a new flaky test.

On the {{shutdownTest} failures I agree it is unlikely related to the change. Perhaps 100 milliseconds is not long enough for the thread to notice it is being shutdown and exit for the join call. Threads should request a nano sleep for at most 10ms, but are not guaranteed to be awoken on a busy CI server and may exceed the test deadline. What do you think about an increase from 100 milliseconds up to 1 second to see if it improves things?


+1 on both changes.

Indeed [a wait of 1 second|https://github.com/adelapena/cassandra/commit/87351868a2b09b605fbd7931e4aba7ef26928ecb] seems to make {{shutdownTest}} not to fail anymore, at least not in these 20K runs:
* [j8-j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/475/workflows/71011b7f-3883-4a73-89cf-552099ff5896/jobs/4200]

I think we could include that here, as part of the fix.

I'm leaving a few very minor suggestions in the commit for {{SEPExecutorTest}}.

+1 from me too, if it is fine with the others I can address on commit the nits from Andres later today. Thank you!

[~e.dimitrova] I have the two patches, the suggestions and few additional minor warning fixes in [this branch|https://github.com/adelapena/cassandra/tree/16668-trunk-review], which is the one used for the CircleCI runs above.

[~adelapena] your changes look good! Thanks for doing that. +1

Committed to 4.0 and propagated to trunk. Thank you all!
