Coverage analysis of the cqlsh unittests (pylib/cqlshlib/test/test*.py) and the dtest cqlsh_tests (cqlsh_tests.py and cqlsh_copy_tests.py) showed no coverage of functions for describing aggregates, functions, indexes, schemas, types, or usertypes.

Before we can release a ported cqlsh, we should either create a new test that exercises these kinds of describe statements, or refute the coverage report by identifying an existing test for these features.
