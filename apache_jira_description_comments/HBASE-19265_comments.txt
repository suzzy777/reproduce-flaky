Very good proposal! Is it possible to run the flaky test when the fix is not related to test code, only source? This might be difficult to track...if possible at all.

I don't think we have sufficient code coverage tooling to do that kind of inference. As we document the flaky list handling, we should point out to contributors that if their patch is meant to fix an untrusted test they'll need to touch that file e.g. with a whitespace change or the like.

I think that's good enough!
