Yarn Service is responsible for calculating the number of instances based on the helix tasks. Yarn service tracks the number of instances by asking Yarn for the number of resource requests and the number of allocated containers.

Â 

It uses this count to determine if it should ask for more containers or shrink the number of containers. This calculation is currently done improperly and we continue to request containers when we have enough requested.
