It turns out that the problem does not necessarily require altering the compaction strategy.
It seems to be rooted in a potential problem with counting the CF compaction requests, that can eventually lead to a skipped background compaction.

The wrong counting can happen if the counting multiset increment [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/95b43b195e4074533100f863344c182a118a8b6c/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/CompactionManager.java#L197] gets delayed and happens after the corresponding counting multiset decrement already happened [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/95b43b195e4074533100f863344c182a118a8b6c/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/CompactionManager.java#L284].

Here are the branches with the proposed changes, as well as a Byteman test that can be used to demonstrate the issue.
testall results look good (3.0 and trunk each have 1 seemingly unrelated, flaky test failing).
dtest results will be added soon.

Good catch, patch and tests LGTM! I looked the results of the dtests on internal CI and they look good (unrelated failures), can you just attach the screen shots so they are public?

I will commit this to 2.2 even though it is in critical fixes mode because it's pretty simple/safe and the only way to solve it is to restart the node if it ever gets into this nasty state.

I added a comment on [CompactionManager.submitBackground|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/35e6d61361e699908d73c277da7d9ac3390f6e5d#diff-d4e3b82e9bebfd2cb466b4a30af07fa4R159] extracted from CASSANDRA-4310 to explain the reasoning behind keeping track of compacting cfs.

Committed to 2.2 as {{35e6d61361e699908d73c277da7d9ac3390f6e5d}} and merged up to cassandra-3.0, cassandra-3.11 and trunk. Thanks!
