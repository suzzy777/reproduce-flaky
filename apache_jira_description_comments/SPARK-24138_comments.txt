cc [~dongjoon] Could you take a look at this?

I see. Sure. [~smilegator]. 

Actually, we observed this situation in our three test suites for both Parquet and ORC.
- SPARK-23458 (ORC)
- SPARK-23505 (Parquet)
- SPARK-23390 (FileBasedDataSource for both ORC/Parquet)

We reduced the number of points of failures with SPARK-23457 and SPARK-23399. But, for now, it seems that we need to reinvestigate this.

For now, I'll merge the failure report to the existing one.
