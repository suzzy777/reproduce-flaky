KUDU-3280: fix flakiness in TabletServerTest.TestStarvePerfImprovementOpsInColdTablet

The test failed because the original perf improvement score
of flush/compaction ops in hot tablet may be always higher
than that in cold tablet. This patch fixed it by increasing
`FLAGS_flush_threshold_mb` and `FLAGS_flush_upper_bound_ms`
and reducing the amount of data written in hot tablet, so
the cold tablet would be compacted if
'workload_score_for_perf_improvement_ops' was diabled.
