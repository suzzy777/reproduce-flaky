Impala s3 tests can encounter failures due to s3's consistency model. S3Guard adds consistency to s3 operations to avoid these types of failures:

Adding support to run tests with S3Guard provides a way to limit flakiness, and it provides coverage for users that would want to use Impala on S3 with S3Guard.

Support will involve adding the appropriate configuration to core-site.xml. In order to maintain the S3Guard index appropriately, file modifications should go through HDFS commands rather than boto s3 commands. Finally, to reduce costs, Impala may want to have a script to purge S3Guard's dynamodb.Â
