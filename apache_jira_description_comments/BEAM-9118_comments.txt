Robert, do you know if anything happened recently that could increase the flakiness of FnAPI/Portable runner tests?
See also: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9119

I'm not aware of anything that has changed here recently.

This issue was marked "stale-assigned" and has not received a public comment in 7 days. It is now automatically unassigned. If you are still working on it, you can assign it to yourself again. Please also give an update about the status of the work.

Is this still an issue?

Happened again yesterday: [https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Commit/14654/]

Note that the default pytest timeout is 600s, but the timeout for portable_runner_test is 60s. Once everything is on pytest, we can remove the bespoke timeout: [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12385]

In the meantime, we can try increasing the bespoke timeout to see if it it fixes the flakiness.

Closing this with the expectation that increasing the timeout will prevent flakes.
