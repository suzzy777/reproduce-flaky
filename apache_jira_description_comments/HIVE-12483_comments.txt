[~xuefuz] schemeAuthority and schemeAuthority2 are passing now. I had to update the the ptest server running in the spark master instance to make it work. There was a race condition causing the errors, but it was solved after the update.

Are the other failing tests passing in your local branch as well?

[~spena], thanks for working on this. The following failures are expected as they happen on master as well: 
{code}
org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestNegativeCliDriver.testNegativeCliDriver_authorization_uri_import
org.apache.hive.jdbc.TestSSL.testSSLVersion
TestHWISessionManager - did not produce a TEST-*.xml file
org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.testCliDriver_cbo_rp_annotate_stats_groupby
{code}
The following are expected to pass and are passing in my local box.
{code}
org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.testCliDriver_auto_join4
org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.testCliDriver_constantPropagateForSubQuery
org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestEncryptedHDFSCliDriver.testCliDriver_encryption_insert_partition_dynamic
{code}


With "expected and passing in my local box" you mean that those errors are expected to fail in ptest? or expected to pass?

Corrected above. Yes. they are expected to pass. They passed when I tried them this morning.

[~xuefuz] Seem the tests failing are flaky tests that are not related to the environment. They have output differences that makes me think the issue has something to do with the commands used in the .q file. I've seen this issues in other .q tests before in master, and we ended changing the .q test to make it work.

Yeah. it's a little tricky. I did a merge last week, and in the first test run after the merge in HIVE-12515 some of these failures went away. Right now we are fixing the build (HIVE-12554), and we should have another test run coming out soon. At that time, we can probably confirm what the issue is gone. Thanks for investigating this. 

Thanks. I will set this task as resolved.
