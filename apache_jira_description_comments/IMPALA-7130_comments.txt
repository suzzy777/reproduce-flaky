IMPALA-7130: impala-shell -b / --kerberos_host_fqdn flag overrides value passed in via -i / --impalad

After additional testing around IMPALA-2782, it was discovered
that impala-shell starts the session displaying the expected
hostname (as passed -i flag) on the prompt. This gives the
impression that the load balancer was bypassed, however the
actual TSSLSocket is still created with the hostname passed
in via the -b or --kerberos_host_fqdn flag.

This change ensures that the hostname used to create the
TSSLSocket will always be the one passed in via the -i flag
on impala-shell. This change is required by IMPALA-2782.

Testing:
Using netcat, we verified that the impala daemon host[:port]
value passed into the -i/--impalad option is indeed the one
impala-shell tries to connect to in both cases (with and
without -b)

[~thundergun]
I have seen some tests failing at test_socket_opening (https://jenkins.impala.io/job/gerrit-verify-dryrun/2691/consoleFull). Port 42000 is in the ephemeral range, so some process may randomly use it, which makes the test inherently flaky.

[~csringhofer],

I suppose that was the original intent. But I see the problem with that.

I've refactored the test to use python's socket.bind(("",0)) function to pick an open port on the fly. Should be less flaky. Will submit it for review shortly.
