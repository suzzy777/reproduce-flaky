Currently, the state directory property in streams' system tests is set to the {{PERSISTENT_ROOT}} variable. Since Streams applications in different tests have the same application ID and the state directory path consists of state directory property + application ID + task ID, it might happen that a dirty state directory of one test is re-used by another test if the state directory is not properly cleaned up. This may lead to unexpected results and false positive and/or flaky failures.

The state directory property shall be set to a randomized path inside {{PERSISTENT_ROOT}} to ensure that tests may not interfere with each other in the case of missing state clean-ups.
