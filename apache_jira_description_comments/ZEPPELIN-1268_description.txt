Being an end user of Apache Zeppelin, I would like to add the following enhancements to the codebase so that I can embed paragraph and also refresh the paragraph content from the custom UI.Note that the custom UI is different from the notebook UI and served by a simple js application.Embedding the paragraph content and refreshing the content of it in the custom UI are done using the Zeppelin REST APIs.

When we analyzed the existing APIs and the notebook UI, we thought that the following would be helpful when someone wants to do the same as mentioned above:

* Expose paragraph id as a new option for each paragraph in the notebook UI say "Get the paragraph id" so that the end user can easily find it out
* Create a new REST API to find out the status of a single paragraph
