    THRIFT-3499: Add package_prefix to python generator

    Permit prefixing import paths with a certain string to support devs who will place the generated code below the top level of their python hierarchy.
    
    This is similar to the go generator's package_prefix generator option.

    The CI build has failed when running the cpp-cpp test twice now. I'm not sure how my python changes could affect this. Am I kicking off the CI incorrectly?
    
    Relevant CI failure line is below:
    ```
    cpp-cpp            compact      http-ip                  timeout(128)
    ```

    Not at all. Some cross tests are flaky and should be excluded, if not fixed immediately.
    In your case the failure is clearly unrelated so no need to re-invoke any more.

    @Jens-G Do I need to do anything else to get this PR moving?
