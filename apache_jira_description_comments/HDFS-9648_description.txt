I saw the Jenkins log shows TestStartup.testImageChecksum has been failing consecutively 5 times.

https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/2724/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode/TestStartup/testImageChecksum/

Seems like HDFS-9569 by Yongjun changed exception message, and this test was looking for the exact message.

Expected to find 'Failed to load an FSImage file!' but got unexpected exception:java.io.IOException: Failed to load FSImage file, see error(s) above for more info.
