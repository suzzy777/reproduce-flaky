When performing a SqlQuery with a WHERE clause containing an {{=}} predicate on a field of type LocalDateTime, the query fails with  {{org.apache.ignite.IgniteCheckedException:Failed to execute SQL query.}} 

This bug occurred in 2.0, the same SqlQuery was working fine on 1.9.

If we dig into the details,the original exception is a {{ClassCastException}} on {{IgniteH2Indexing:3663}}.

When doing the same kind of query with a WHERE clause on a String type, it works.
You can find a test case showing that here: https://github.com/bgaraude/IgniteTest


I think this is related to IGNITE-4172, but this ticket says that the patch has to be updated once H2 has been updated.
It seems that ignite 2.0 uses an updated version of H2: 1.4.195. This H2 version supports LocalDateTime. At least {{org.h2.value.DataType.getTypeFromClass}} returns TimeStamp for the LocalDateTime class. But {{IgniteH2Indexing$RowDescriptor.wrap()}} has not been updated accordingly. Hence, the ClassCastException.

Do you know a workaround i can use while this issue is fixed?
