Types c1 STRING, c2 CHAR(50), c3 VARCHAR(50) are converted to DOUBLE in table table_change_string_group_double.

Older code:
{code}
103	NULL	NULL	NULL	original
{code}

Current code:
{code}
103	NULL	0.0	NULL	original
{code}

The lengths of line 103 are:
{code}
103	0	0	0	original
{code}

Which is from the input text file schema_evolution.txt
{code}
103||||||||||||||||||||||||||filler
{code}

So, why is just the CHAR type converting differently?



Since conversion is involved, we use VectorDeserializeRead to set the HiveCharWritable and that class uses VectorAssignRow to convert from HiveCharWritable (length 0) to DoubleWritable using PrimitiveObjectInspectorUtils.getDouble.



First time the error:

{code}
org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver.testCliDriver[schema_evol_text_vec_table] (batchId=147)
{code}

showed up was this Hive QA run:
 [jira] [Commented] (HIVE-15743) vectorized text parsing: speed up double parse

Sent e-mail to Teddy Choi.

It's due to HIVE-15743. Double.parseDouble throws an exception when it gets a zero sized string while StringToDouble.strtod doesn't. Sorry for making this error.

[~mmccline], I sent an e-mail with a patch to you. Please attach it. Or may I assign it to me then proceed?

I attached the patch.

And assigned it to you.
