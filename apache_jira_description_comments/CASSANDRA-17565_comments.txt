This is similar to CASSANDRA-16277 but the connection is further along.  [Branch|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra/tree/CASSANDRA-17565] to silence the error and [4000 runs|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/443/workflows/f7abfc54-4f1d-4415-b4d3-0b00984be262/jobs/5182] in circle...but that didn't work, so ignore this.

bq. but that didn't work, so ignore this.

To clarify, there are 7 failures in that run, but 6 were git errors and one was legit.

Not trusting the results, I did another [4000 runs|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/443/workflows/8e7a307a-4a13-4c00-ab45-ca65b48ac602/jobs/5184] and got one failure again...however, examining the line number, that has to be from the 4.0 side, and indeed it needs the same patch.  But now the question is, can the upgrade test be run with both a custom 4.0 and trunk branch?  If not, perhaps this is enough to commit the trunk side, and then we can run 4k with a custom 4.0 branch against it, which should prove out the whole thing.

Here are the branches and precommit CI on circle:

Triaging and found this one, should we move it to patch available?

No, this breaks the handleCorruptionOfLargeMessageFrame test.  I'll come back to this at some point and investigate.

This actually did not break that test, it's a flaky: CASSANDRA-17630.  It was previously overshadowed in butler by being linked to the CASSANDRA-17321 umbrella ticket, but I've broken it out.

I'll get this upgrade test run against both branches together in circle.

bq. I'll get this upgrade test run against both branches together in circle.

Nevermind, upgrade_through_versions.py is not ready to handle custom branches easily.  Marking patch available.

I think you can do multiple custom branches in upgrade tests. At least I think I did by tweaking [this|https://github.com/blerer/cassandra-dtest/blob/master/upgrade_tests/upgrade_manifest.py#L125]. Do you want to give it a try or should we go ahead with this one?

Also another trick is to replace the the versions ccm caches locally with whatever build you actually want. It's somewhere under ~/.ccm iirc

Ah thanks, I'd looked in the manifest before but missed that spot so the link really helped.  I've got it running in circle [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/492/workflows/f07ccd12-6c4b-4a2e-97d2-873ab943ee4a].

It looks good, latest CI is greeeeeen but we seem to have 4.0 and trunk patches, wouldn't we need 4.1 also?

Yep, this ticket has bridged that gap now so it needs addressing.

Note that I had to add indev_4_1_x to indev_trunk since 4.1 had no upgrades in the manifest.  I can address this in CASSANDRA-17645.




Trunk dtests look broken, but that is strange bc everything else is green. Maybe re-run trunk in hope it was some env issue?

Strange indeed, and circle is [being strange again|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/446/workflows/be2bcaaa-e0a5-40ae-88e2-8e220fb35446] so I'm going back to [old faithful|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1733/].

I think what happened is the new docker image kicked in for trunk and I needed a rebase, which is [here|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra/tree/CASSANDRA-17565-trunk] with [j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/498/workflows/543edd8b-1ea3-46b3-b5d3-1cc8ba958999] and [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/498/workflows/2ac764c5-7a06-4951-83c2-a91db03ae0f6].

Ok yep, the new trunk run LGTM. +1.

Committed, thank you.
