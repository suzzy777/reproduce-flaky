   ### Description of PR
   
   Cherry-pick two PRs from trunk to branch-3.3 for fixing TestBPOfferService#testMissBlocksWhenReregister
   
   HDFS-15654: minor conflict due to `testCommandProcessingThreadExit` being backported to branch-3.3 before HDFS-15654.
   HDFS-15674: clean cherry-pick. 
   
   ### How was this patch tested?
   
   Run tests three times without error.
   
   ` mvn test -Dtest="TestBPOfferService"`

   This PR only changed TestBPOfferService. It does not change any other files. The failed hdfs unit tests are probably due to flaky minihdfs.

   It looks like four different unit tests failed the second time and there is no overlap between the first and second build. I guess unit tests were run in different orders between different builds and thus we see different unit tests failed each time. 
   
   @ashutoshcipher, I don't think these non-deterministic unit tests failures are related with this PR, since we only modified TestBPOfferService.java. What do you think? 




ashutoshcipher commented on PR #5089:

   Thanks @xinglin. Can you verify the failed tests once by running them in your local with the patch?

   Tried a couple of times to run these unit tests locally. They did fail sometimes but also managed to get a few success runs. I don't think we should block this PR by these non-deterministic/not relevant unit tests failures.
