Patches are very similar, but not exact (for example, trunk patch doesn't wait on all-nodes-at-least-2.2, because that's already required)

+1, only minor nit is that on {{CassandraRoleManager}}, {{hasExistingRoles}} and {{isClusterReady}} could be made package private. 
I haven't been able to look at the utest results as CircleCI is just giving me the spinning logo treatment. Dtests look OK relative to upstream, there were a couple of failures in the auth tests, but I checked them out locally and don't believe they're related.

Actually, I take back the comment about dtests, it looks like the failures in {{cql_test:AbortedQueryTester}} are down to errors from the earlier existing roles check during setup, before {{TokenMetadata}} is setup. CASSANDRA-11381 changed behaviour so that the auth setup also runs {{join_ring=false}}, but it adds a guard in {{CRM::setupDefaultRole}} to check that {{TokenMetadata}} isn't empty before calling {{hasExistingRoles}}. I think we'll need a similar check in {{setup}} so that  if TM is empty then we shouldn't try and set {{isClusterReady}} eagerly. 


Pushed new commits to all branches that:

- Make the specified methods package private, and

- Check TMD for tokens before calling hasExistingRoles (if no tokens, we proceed down the original path).

Dtest links for the changes:

3.0 - https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Cassandra/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/99/
3.11 - https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Cassandra/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/100/
trunk - https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Cassandra/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/101/



Thanks, the changes LGTM. The dtest results still look a bit dodgy though, particularly the 3.11 run. How stable are those dev branch jobs now? There seem to be several tests failing/erroring which aren't showing as flaky on the mainline branch jobs.

Didnt get a chance to triage dtests before they rolled over back in July, so kicked off anew:

3.0 - https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Cassandra/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/280/
3.11 - https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Cassandra/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/281/
trunk - https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Cassandra/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/282/


[~samt] i have no idea if this patch matters anymore. Not in a position to drive it if it does. Just FYI. 


This still looks valid, but needs a rebase for 4.0 and later.
