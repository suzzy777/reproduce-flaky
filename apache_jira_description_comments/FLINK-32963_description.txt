We are proposing to make the following test stable:

{{org.apache.flink.runtime.state.FileStateBackendMigrationTest.testKeyedMapStateStateMigration}}

The test is currently flaky because the order of elements returned by the iterator is non-deterministic.

The following PR fixes the flaky test by making it independent of the order of elements returned by the iterator:
[https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/23298]

We detected this using the NonDex tool using the following command:

{{mvn edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -pl flink-runtime -DnondexRuns=10 -Dtest=org.apache.flink.runtime.state.FileStateBackendMigrationTest#testKeyedMapStateStateMigration}}

Please see the following Continuous Integration log that shows the flakiness:

Please see the following Continuous Integration log that shows that the flakiness is fixed by this change:
