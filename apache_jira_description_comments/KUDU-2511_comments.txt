As it turned out, the problem was in {{kudu::ParseVersion()}} -- the function could not parse input string {{1.8.0-xxx-SNAPSHOT}}, effectively disabling the movement of RF1 tablet replicas.  However, the test asserted on a movement of at least one replica in that scenario, failing as the result.

Fixed with 7e733a73652db68342859d03d02763ef5e3de79d
