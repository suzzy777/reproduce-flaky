auditlog_test.py::TestAuditlog::test_archiving_fql  and test_fql_nodetool_options fail from time to time due to the test relying on a race condition; we do not close chronicle queue so rotation may not happen before stopping archiver, the tests fail if rotation happens before stopping archiver (which is done based off GC).
