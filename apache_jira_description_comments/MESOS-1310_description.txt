When slave authentication is enabled, a (re-)registration could be queued if authentication is in progress. This causes registerSlave/reregisterSlave methods to be enqueued via a defer.

This means when registerSlave/reregisterSlave is eventually executed the 'from' field of the base ProtobufProcess might not be set. But the these methods call 'reply()' which expects 'from' to be set crashing the master.

Fix: Instead of calling reply(), do an explicit 'send(from, message)' where 'from' is the argument passed to the function.
