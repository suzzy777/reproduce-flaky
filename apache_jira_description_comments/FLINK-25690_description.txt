RetryRule is a Flink junit rule that allows to retry tests when they temporary fail (either by throwing an exception or by failing an assertion) usually in case of load. In some cases, there is some treatment to be done for the test to be idempotent when retried for example cleaning of created data etc...

Of course, this callback will be optional.
