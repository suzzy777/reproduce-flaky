This is about to simply applying https://github.com/kgyrtkirk/hive-test-kube/pull/11 to hive's master [Jenkinsfile|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/Jenkinsfile]
current artifacts are simply useless, flaky tests are impossible to investigate (no, they don't reproduce in flaky-check, damn)

looks like the job simply picks up Jenkinsfile from the root: http://ci.hive.apache.org/job/hive-precommit/configure
