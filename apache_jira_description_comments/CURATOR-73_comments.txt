I believe I have a possible fix for this issue. A patch is attached.

What the patch does is move the clearing of isQueued-flag out so that it is
 done whenever the actual callable executing takeLeadership() returns.

The isQueued-flag was not cleared when mutex.acquire() failed.
mutex.acquire() can fail when
1. you are not the current leader, but you are waiting for leadership. and
2. connection is lost or suspended.
Then the leader-selector cannot be requeued when the connection comes back.

Test case is also attached.

Regarding the test case. It seemed flaky at first, but when I added one additional sleep it works better:
{code}
timing.sleepABit();
timing.sleepABit();
{code}

I applied the patch but left the original clearIsQueued() as it was. This has been merged into master and pushed.
