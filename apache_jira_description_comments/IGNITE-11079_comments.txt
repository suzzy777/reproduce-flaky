Dedicated TC run for this test: [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_MvccQueries&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F6249%2Fhead|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_MvccQueries&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F6249%2Fhead]

Problem: The problem was that [implemented optimization|https://github.com/gridgain/apache-ignite/commit/42293fac88c29544b7c55c0340224afbf474a301] of storing filtered events in the backup queues was not taken into account for this test. After this optimization backups do not store all filtered events and instead storing they use {{filtered}} counter. In this case the expectation of the large size of backup queues is wrong.

Fix: fixed the expectation of backup queues total size - it should be small or even zero.

 Since the only test code was changed, the RunAll visa from the TC Bot is not necessary. I've runned two relevant suites (mvcc and non-mvcc). Waiting for results:

[~amashenkov], tests are OK. Patch is ready for review.

Merged to master.

Thank for contribution.
