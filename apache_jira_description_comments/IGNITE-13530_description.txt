Exception handling in TcpClientChannel is inconsistent:
* Some code is duplicated in {{receive}} and {{convertException}}
* Some exception types, like {{ClientAuthenticationException}}, are wrapped in {{ClientException}}

Make sure to preserve exception types when rethrowing them and deduplicate the code.
