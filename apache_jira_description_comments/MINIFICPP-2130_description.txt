GitHub Actions caches have a 10 GB storage limit for the repository, and it evicts older caches automatically. Because the caches are immutable, we're forced to create a new, separate cache key for each run. We need a cleanup job that cleans up older than latest cache entries for each branch, remove caches for closed pull requests, and if we're near the limit, start removing non-main / pull request caches, since pull requests can fall back to the main branch cache.
