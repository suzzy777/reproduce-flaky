Nice fix [~lineyshinya]. I merged to tip of branch-1. [~apurtell] Shout if you want it to go back to other branches.

[~stack] Shout! I think the 1.4 that just went out is the last but there might be more 1.3s. So if not too much trouble...

Thank you for reviewing and merging! Will this be released in 1.5.1? May I create a backport PR for branch-1.3 and branch-1.4 (I think I miss 1.4.11, but I don't know branch-1.4 will be 1.4.12 or EOL after 1.4.11?)?

Do I need to create a ticket for backporting?

Reopening so we can backport.

[~lineyshinya] mind making patches for older branches ? I tried backporting the commit on branch-1 but rejects.

It looks like tip of branch-1 is where 1.5 was cut from so whatever is next off the tip of branch-1 -- whether 1.5.1 or 1.6.0, it will get this patch.

No need to open a new issue. I reopened this one as host for the backports. Thansk.

Thank you for reopening and detailed info. Yes, I'll create a patch for branch-1.3 and branch-1.4 soon.

Sorry, seems my change breaks some tests.

I reverted this from branch-1 because it's causing TestMasterNoCluster and TestCatalogJanitor to fail there.

[~lineyshinya] You see Sean's message above?  Saw it because I tripped over https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/748/files. Thanks. Once it goes in successfully here I can do the backports. Thanks.

#748 should work fine because it contains test fix: [https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/748/commits/45c7e3588f6c503d8f95f2cf6387549ee380da0b]

 

Could you confirm it? I run hbase-server tests and finished successfully.

[https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/748#issuecomment-547403969]

 

This also contains hbase-server tests passing.

I merged the commit. WIll check nightly to see if the two tests Sean identified start failing again. Thanks for the fix [~lineyshinya]

Thank you too all! I hope to see all green and to have a good night tonight ;)

Checked build last night. Looks like both of the tests [~busbey] referenced passed:

https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-1/1124/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master/TestMasterNoCluster/

https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-1/1124/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master/TestCatalogJanitor/

Let me try backports.



Re-resolving. Merged branch-1 and branch-1.3 and branch-1.4 patches. Thanks for patches [~lineyshinya]

Ah, you already merged #745 and #743... Sorry, but I didn't yet add the fixing the test code commit yet...

So we need revert them or add a test fix commit as soon as possible.

I'll create a test fix PR for these branches today, but I need several hours because I'm now out.

If you need to fix these branches ASAP, please revert them once...

Test code fix for branch-1.3 [https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/786] [~stack]

If you prefer to revert once and retry it with test code fix let me know please and revert the backport commit. I'll update #786 like #748.

 

I'm not sure this commit is necessary for branch-1.4, I'll wait for the CI report here

Let me reopen. Let me then apply your test code changes. Thank you for being on top of this [~lineyshinya].

Created fixing PR for branch-1.4: [https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/788] because it seems branch-1.4 will failed without this.

branch-1.3: [https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/786]

 

Thank you for helping me to fix this!

Thank you [~lineyshinya]. I merged both patches. Lets leave this issue open till we see that both branch-1.3 and branch-1.4 pass for the above mentioned test failures.

Took a look at recent 1.4 nightly.

https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-1.4/1076/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master/TestMasterNoCluster/

1.3 nightly

https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-1.3/1027/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master/TestMasterNoCluster/

These seems good.

TestCatalogJanitor might be still sick...  It fails here on last 1.3 nightly https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-1.4/1075/ 

Will see how it does in next run. Leaving open in meantime.


TestCatalogJanitor is in the flakies list still. ... it is added as a flakie when 1.3 runs ... https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/branch-1.3/1029/consoleFull ... but no mention here https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-1.3/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dashboard.html which is odd. The test is still in the code base. Will let it percolate another while then will dig in.



If it's not in that list at all it probably passed every time. Check the Jenkins test summary for the job to confirm

Yeah all passes

https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-1.3/test_results_analyzer/

Thats a nice tool. Thanks for intercession [~busbey] and pointer.

Resolving as done. Thanks for the patch [~lineyshinya]
