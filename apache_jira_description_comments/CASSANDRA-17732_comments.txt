Patch submitted [here |https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra-dtest/pull/new/17732] 

This will affect all branches but for now I am submitting [preliminary CI run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=17732-trunk&filter=all] to see how things look like. I will check on some of the failures we've seen recently too.

More tomorrow. 

I tried to reproduce the failure [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1777/workflows/0c9e66c2-8f1a-4249-901d-33fbf8c5f501/jobs/12951] with no success. But we see also other tests failing with that error.

So I am fairly confident we need this update and it won't break anything.

I rebased the DTest patch and submitted Python DTests for all branches: 

[cassandra-3.0|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1778/workflows/3ac2351a-89a3-45d0-990e-2254e3974b77], [cassandra-3.11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1779/workflows/ec3fe1cf-649c-46d1-aaff-eb3e71cec57e], [cassandra-4.0|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=17732-4.0], [cassandra-4.1|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=17732-4.1], [trunk|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=17732-trunk]

I agree we need this, +1 on the patch if CI looks good.

3.0 226 upgrade tests timed out. Restarted them [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1778/workflows/3ac2351a-89a3-45d0-990e-2254e3974b77/jobs/13015] as I suspect environmental issue.

3.11 upgrade tests also timeout. Restarted them [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1779/workflows/ec3fe1cf-649c-46d1-aaff-eb3e71cec57e/jobs/13030]

The rest looks quite good - 4.1 and trunk are fully green, 4.0 has only 2 known flaky tests failing

I am fairly sure the upgrade tests failures are not related and are known but for confirmation I just started them with unpatched [3.0|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1783/workflows/03577cf2-2be9-4b14-8339-d9ae4f4b4a22] and [3.11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1784/workflows/9a787e4f-3b3b-4926-8253-d3405261895f].

 

Same failures popped up. I will commit this patch and open a follow up ticket for those upgrade tests as also it seems some of them are skipped in Jenkins, needs to be clarified.
