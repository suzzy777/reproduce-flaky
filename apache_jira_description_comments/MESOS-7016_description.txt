libprocess defines a number of helpers {{AWAIT_*}} to wait for a {{process::Future}} reaching terminal states. These helpers are used in tests.

Currently the default duration to wait before triggering an assertion failure is 15s. This value was chosen as a compromise between failing fast on likely fast developer machines, but also allowing enough time for tests to pass in high-contention environments (e.g., overbooked CI machines).

If a machine is more overloaded than expected, {{Futures}} might take longer to reach the desired state, and tests could fail. Ultimately we should consider running tests with paused clock to eliminate this source of test flakiness, see MESOS-4101, but as an intermediate measure we should make the default timeout duration configurable.

A simple approach might be to expose a build variable allowing users to set at configure/cmake time a desired timeout duration for the setup they are building for. This would allow us to define longer timeouts in the CI build scripts, while keeping default timeouts as short as possible.
