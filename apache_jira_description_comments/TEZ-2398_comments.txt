[~rajesh.balamohan] Any logs on this ?

No [~zjffdu] - Unfortunately the old builds in pre-commit shows 404 for https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-TEZ-Build/593//testReport/.  I will check locally and update if it persists.  

1) removes check in testbasicinputfailure because the attempt which is expected to not see any input errors, may actually see input errors because of scheduling/launching delays.
2) fixed testInput to not hang because of race between handleEvents and doRead when multiple input versions arrive at the same time.
3) reduce minicluster NMs to 3 to reduce the number of parallel processes. that decreases the number of concurrent containers in the test and reduces flakiness for large tests like testRandomFailingInputs. These fail intermittently due to container launch errors because of overload.
Ran TestFaultTolerance in a loop for 10 runs without any error. Before this it would fail in 1 out of 3 runs due to 1) and 3).

[~rajesh.balamohan] [~zjffdu] Please review.
