As part of CASSANDRA-16895 initial POC an initial version of CCM patch was created. This needs to be revisited and reviewed

Recently we closed CASSANDRA-18039 which brought questions, probably we need to revise how we detect JDK versions in CCM and whether it is correct. To the best of my knowledge there are certain tests in the repo around that and they pass so my guess is we need to revise just the strategy and maybe document it explicitly or consider if we want any changes to be applied. Also, we need to be careful with breaking changes.
