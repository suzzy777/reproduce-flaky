In additional to being slow, this test has become flaky in Jenkins and has started OOMing in Maven builds, so I'm going to begin working to fix this now.

User 'JoshRosen' has created a pull request for this issue:

[~andrewor14] so this patch shouldn't really help in 1.6 nor master, since akka is not used for RPC there. Josh pointed at a failure in the 1.5 build, so maybe the patch should be backported there.

oh I didn't realize, does the new RPC system have the same problem in master though?

I back ported it into 1.5.

[~vanzin], we actually _did_ see this fail in the master builds, too, and it's also really slow there, so this change is also relevant for master and 1.6.

But master and 1.6 don't use akka by default. So the change you made should have no effect in those branches, and we'll probably still see errors if there's something wrong.

I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with your change, just that it may not actually fix anything in master / 1.6 if you've seen these errors there.
