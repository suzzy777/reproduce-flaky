With OOZIE-2339 the functionality was extended with the possibility of uploading the workflow.xml programatically. For more details check [WebServicesAPI.md#embedded-workflow-xml-job-submission|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/docs/src/site/markdown/WebServicesAPI.md#embedded-workflow-xml-job-submission]

The exception is created when trying to create the workflow.xml. At this point no workflow.xml exist on the defined path and no generated value is defined for the workflow.xml to be created, so int the uploaded patch I only extended the error message to the following one:
{code:bash}
Error: E0307 : E0307: Runtime error [hdfs://localhost:9000/user/test/examples10/apps/java-main/workflow.xml does not exist and it cannot be created because of missing config value oozie.jobs.api.generated.xml]{code}

Thanks for the contribution [~kmarton]! For backwards compatibility, do you mind adding a prefix like that to the error message:
{{App directory [...] does not exist and it cannot be created because of missing configuration value [...].}} 

PreCommit-OOZIE-Build started


[~andras.piros], I have changed the message as you suggested. Now the error message is the following one:

{code:bash}
Error: E0307 : E0307: Runtime error [App directory [hdfs://localhost:9000/user/martonjuliakinga/examples10/apps/java-main] does not exist and app definition cannot be created because of missing config value [oozie.jobs.api.generated.xml]]
{code}

The error code is also changed since in the earlier version was Error: E0504, what if specifically for missing app path, but now in our case is something more. Besides the missing app path, the app definition content is also missing, so the workflow.xml creation is not possible.


Thanks for the new patch [~kmarton]! +1 (pending Jenkins)

[~kmarton] can you please have a look?

[~andras.piros] I will kick off another build. I think that the cause is the following: 
{code:bash}
14:52:40 Error occurred in starting fork, check output in log. 
{code}
Unfortunately our precommit script is not handling this case right now.

Thank you [~andras.piros] for the review! The last PreCommit seems to be OK. 

Committed to master and to branch-5.1

Closing issue; Oozie 5.2.0 is released
