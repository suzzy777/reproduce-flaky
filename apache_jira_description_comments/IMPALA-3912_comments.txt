Assigning to Juan since she is most familiar with this test.

[~jyu@cloudera.com] have you had a chance to take a look?  We should stay on top of fixing flaky tests.

IMPALA-3912: test_random_rpc_timeout is flaky.
Datastream sender default timeout is 2 mins which could
block some fragments to complete until the timeout and
cause the metric "num-fragments-in-flight" not back to 0
after 60 seconds.
Decrease the sender timeout to 30 seconds and adding
some logging.
