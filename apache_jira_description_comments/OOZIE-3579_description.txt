- A synchronous coordinator definition -is a- is defined by a name
- -A timeout of `0` indicates that at the time of materialization all the other conditions must be satisfied, else the action will be discarded.- A timeout of `0` indicates that if all the input events are not satisfied at the time of action materialization, the action should timeout immediately.
- A Coordinator Job that -creates an- executes a single coordinator action
