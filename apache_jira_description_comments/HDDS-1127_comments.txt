+1, Please do. Let us also spend some time on these tests, some times they are flaky by design. So it might be a good idea to rewrite them or modify code to be more testable.

If you look at the hadoop-aws and hadoop-azure test suites, we run them in parallel through some javascript magic in the pom and the use of per-fork temporary directories. Can't you do the same here?

Yes, we can, thx the hint. I will definitely check the javascript magic. But this is a parallel effort: I would like to reduce the time of the unit tests (I would also prefer to convert some of the MiniOzoneCluster based unit tests to real unit tests.)

But as a first step I would like to fix all the failing tests.

I am managing the 1.1.0 release and we currently have more than 600 issues targeted for 1.1.0. I am moving the target field to 1.2.0. 

If you are actively working on this jira and believe this should be targeted to 1.1.0 release, Please change the target field back to 1.1.0 before Feb 05, 2021. 

I am managing the 1.2.0 release and we currently have more than 600 issues targeted for 1.2.0. I am moving the target field to 1.3.0.

If you are actively working on this jira and believe this should be targeted for the 1.2.0 release, Please reach out to me via Apache email or Slack.

Ozone 1.3.0 had been released and we currently have more than 600 open issues targeted for 1.3.0. I am moving the target field to 1.4.0.

If there is anything needs to be discussed about the Target Version, Please reach out to me via Apache email or Slack.
