Threads in DN (DataXceiver, PacketResponder, Async disk worker etc) may block at BPOfferService.getBlockPoolId() when calling BPOfferService.checkBlock(), though they are just reading the same blockpool id. This is unnecessary overhead and may cause performance hit when many threads compete. Filing this jira to replace synchronized method with read write lock (ReentrantReadWriteLock).
