This could be caused by KAFKA-8275. I will have a patch ready soon.

hachikuji commented on pull request #6746: KAFKA-8376; Least loaded node should consider connections which are being prepared
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6746
 
 
   This fixes a regression caused by KAFKA-8275. The least loaded node selection should take into account nodes which are currently being connect to. This includes both the CONNECTING and CHECKING_API_VERSIONS states since `canSendRequest` would return false in either case.
