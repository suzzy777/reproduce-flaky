The warning is known, but due to the caveat that is printed right below the warning

NOTE: You can safely ignore the above warning unless this call should not happen.  Do not suppress it by blindly adding an EXPECT_CALL() if you don't mean to enforce the call.  See https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/docs/CookBook.md#knowing-when-to-expect for details.

I left it, because the test does not really care about whether `disconnect()` is called or not.

Fixed flakiness in MasterAPITest.OperationUpdatesUponOfferGone.

It could happen that the first offer was sent before the allocator
had been updated with the resources from the resource provider.

To further increase reliability, stopped the clock during this test.
