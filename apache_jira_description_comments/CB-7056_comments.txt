    This breaks the specs. @jsoref could you please take a look at this.
    The errors are different depending on whether you run "npm test" or "jasmine-node spec-cordova/serve.spec.js". And the errors are different on OSX and Linux. Might be some problem with chdirs and temp folders.

    CB-7056 serve: fix Android test, make tests conditional

    Fix **Android** merges codepath, as it turns out that merges
    doesn't need the platform specific hack.
    
    Adding **BlackBerry 10** test.
    
    **Android**, **iOS** and **BlackBerry 10** require specific scripts
    to be available, otherwise they fail.
    
    Introduce `itifapps` and `cit` (conditional `it`) based on **Jasmine**'s:
    
    * `xit` -- ignore test
    * `iit` -- run these tests, but skip it tests
    * `it` -- run these tests, unless there are iit tests

[ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cordova-lib.git;h=2cc872f ]

CB-7056 make tests conditional using it/xit instead of iit/it

Apparently iit in any files makes jasmine skip all it tests in all
other files...

To address some flakiness in the tests, temp directory changes
between each test.
