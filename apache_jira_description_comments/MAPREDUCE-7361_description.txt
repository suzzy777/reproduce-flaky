h2. What is the purpose of this change

This PR is to clean the polluted shared status among the 3 tests: 
{code:java}
Test1: org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestTaskProgressReporter.testBytesWrittenRespectingLimit
Test2: org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestTaskProgressReporter.testScratchDirSize
Test3: org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestTaskProgressReporter.testTaskProgress{code}
Test1 and Test2 pollute the shared status with Test3, which can make test3 fail. It may be better to clean state pollutions so that some other tests won't fail in the future due to the shared state polluted by this test.
h2. Reproduce the test failures

Run the tests in the same JVM in the following orders:
 * Test1 and Test3
 * Test2 and Test3

h2. Expected result

The tests should run successfully when multiple tests that use this shared state are run in the same JVM.
h2. Actual result
 * Run Test1 and Test3, Test3 fails:

{code:java}
 [ERROR] TestTaskProgressReporter.testTaskProgress:267 expected:<[2]> but was:<[3]>{code}
 * Run Test2 and Test3, Test3 fails:

{code:java}
 [ERROR] TestTaskProgressReporter.testTaskProgress:267 expected:<[2]> but was:<[11]>{code}
h2. Fix

Clean the value of {{statusUpdateTimes}} to 0 at the start of Test3 to clean the pollution from Test1 and Test2.
