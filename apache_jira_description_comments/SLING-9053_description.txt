In cloud environment, it is likely to have 503 or broken connection at a very low rate <1% of requests. This add unwanted flakiness to tests.

Generally 503 or broken connection should be retried (at least that is recommended), thus it would be nice to introduce it on the AbstractSlingClient.doRequest(...) which seems to be the best place as common code (doGet, doPost etc..).
