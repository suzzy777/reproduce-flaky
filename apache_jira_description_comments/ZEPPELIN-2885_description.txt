When attempting to use H2O from Zeppelin, paragraphs fail with
{{AttributeError: 'Logger' object has no attribute 'isatty'}}, due to Zeppelin using a custom class to capture output and redirect it.

While adding a stub method to return false is possible (similar to what was done previously for ZEPPELIN-734), I think it would be better to have Logger inherit from a {{TextIO}} class and override the {{write}} method, increasing compatibility with libraries that use stdout.
