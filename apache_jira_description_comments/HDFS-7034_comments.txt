The cause of the failure of TestBlockPlacement is, in {{BlockManager#useDelHint}}, we remove the {{delHint.getStorageType())}} from {{excessTypes}}, which can cause {{chooseReplicaToDelete}} to wrongly return null.

In the meanwhile, TestStorageMover is flaky. Will keep digging.



Looks like there are several issues causing the current TestStorageMover flaky:
# A block report, which contains only block deletion, currently happens every (100 * heartbeat_interval) period of time. Thus before we verify files' storage policy, we should manually trigger the block report from all the datanodes.
# Currently {{testHotWarmColdDirs}} contains a DISK-only DataNode, and the total number of DN is 6. Then for a hot file, if its initial 3 hot replicas are all in DN with both DISK and ARCHIVE, finally we cannot make it "pure cold".
# For {{testNoSpaceDisk}}, the creation of the mover.id file may fail because of the limited DISK space. Maybe we can add a configuration prop to disable the mover.id file creation only for tests.
# The current delay time for a DN with error is 10s. In our test, since we only have 6 DN, and the block deletion report may be delayed, a DN can be marked with error if its original replica was actually removed but itself was still selected for block replacement. In this scenario, this long time delay may cause the migration of other blocks to fail. Thus we should use smaller delay value in our tests.

Will upload a patch with the above fix later.

Upload the patch.

Since the new conf properties are for testing only.  How about simply adding some static variables (like Dispatcher.blockMoveWaitTime) instead of confs?

+1 Patch looks good other than that.

Thanks for the review, Nicholas! Update the patch to address your comments.

I've committed this.
