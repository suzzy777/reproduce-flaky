About the test results:
- HIVE-15776 - Flaky test: TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver vector_if_expr
- org.apache.hive.jdbc.TestJdbcDriver2.testResultSetMetaData failing for a while now
- TestTextFileHCatStorer errors are not reproducible locally

[~ychena], [~kgyrtkirk]: Could you please review?

[~aihuaxu], [~stakiar]: Your two below patches were reviewed, and tested parallel, and combined they cause TestBeeLineDriver fails, which are handled here:
- HIVE-16297: Improving hive logging configuration variables
- HIVE-16308: PreExecutePrinter and PostExecutePrinter should log to INFO level instead of ERROR 

[~sershe], [~vikram.dixit]: I have changed the IOContext key and you were the ones who modified this part of the code at the last time. Could you please review, at least this small change?
{code:title=Utilities.java}
  public static void setMapRedWork(Configuration conf, MapredWork w, Path hiveScratchDir) {
    String useName = conf.get(INPUT_NAME);
    if (useName == null) {
      useName = "mapreduce:" + hiveScratchDir;
    }
    conf.set(INPUT_NAME, useName);
    setMapWork(conf, w.getMapWork(), hiveScratchDir, true);
    if (w.getReduceWork() != null) {
      conf.set(INPUT_NAME, useName);
      setReduceWork(conf, w.getReduceWork(), hiveScratchDir, true);
    }
  }
{code}

Thanks,
Peter

Instead of the needsContinuation method refactor moved the getCommands to BeeLine, so we can reuse the whole file parsing algorithm in the tests.
Modified the test classes to use the BeeLine.getCommands method
Added a warning message, when use database command is used in the test script
