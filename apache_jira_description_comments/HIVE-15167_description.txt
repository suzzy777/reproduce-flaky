SerDe interfaces were deprecated in HIVE-4007 to suggest that users do not implement them. However, this results in deprecation warnings all over the codebase where they are actually used.
We should un-deprecate (reprecate? precate?) them. We can add a comment for implementers instead (we could add a method with a clearly bogus name like useThisAbstractClassInstead, and implement it in the class, so it would be noticeable, but that would break compat).
