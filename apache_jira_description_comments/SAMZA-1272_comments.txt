    SAMZA-1272 : ZkCoordinationUtils deletes the entire Zk tree on reset

    * ZkCoordinationUtils has a reset interface that deletes the entire Zk tree. This is not desirable.
    * Also, fixed flakiness in unit test by unique barrier name in each of the unit tests. Otherwise, they share the same path on Zk and fail during concurrent test execution
