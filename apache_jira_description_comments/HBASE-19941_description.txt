Currently its categorized as MediumTests but sometimes running all test in this class take more than 180 seconds. Here is the comparison of runtimes between local runs (on my dev machine) and in nightly runs:
||Test||Local (seconds)||Nihgtly (seconds)||
|testSimpleCreateWithSplits|~1.5|~12|
|testRollbackAndDoubleExecutionOnMobTable|~4.7|~21|
|testSimpleCreate|~1.7|~11|
|testRollbackAndDoubleExecution|~4.3|~18|
|testMRegions|~26.4|Timed out after 90 seconds|
