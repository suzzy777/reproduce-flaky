Actually, the code looks correct to me. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70031993/memorysanitzer-warns-of-use-of-undefined-memory-in-struct-stat-i-do-check-the

The report is a misfire caused by missing libc interceptors in MemorySanitizer. See the SO question for details on that.

For msan to work correctly, ideally everything in the program (openssl, cyrussasl, python, proton) should be compiled with msan. This is a tall order.

Running Valgrind to check for uninitialized memory use in GHA is possible, it takes 1 hour wall time the way sharding and -j2 is set up now. That amounts to something like 160 minutes of CPU time. The tests are not excessively flaky, even with Valgrind. This means nightly or weekly Valgrind run in some suitable CI is a possibility. (The valgrind suppressions file has gone out of date since Valgrind was last used in qdrouterd, so it would need to be brought back from obsolescence.)
