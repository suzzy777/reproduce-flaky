File this jira to introduce a tool to detect flaky tests of hadoop jenkins test jobs. Certainly it can be adapted to projects other than hadoop.

I developed the tool on top of some initial work [~tlipcon] did. We find it quite useful. With Todd's agreement, I'd like to push it to upstream so all of us can share (thanks Todd for the initial work and support). I hope you find the tool useful too.

The idea is, when one has the need to see if the test failure s/he is seeing in a pre-build jenkins run is flaky or not, s/he could run this tool to get a good idea. Also, if one wants to look at the failure trend of a testcase in a given jenkins job, the tool can be used too. I hope people find it useful.

This tool is for hadoop contributors rather than hadoop users. Thanks [~tedyu] for the advice to put to dev-support dir.

Description of the tool:
{code}
#
# Given a jenkins test job, this script examines all runs of the job done
# within specified period of time (number of days prior to the execution
# time of this script), and reports all failed tests.
#
# The output of this script includes a section for each run that has failed
# tests, with each failed test name listed.
#
# More importantly, at the end, it outputs a summary section to list all failed
# tests within all examined runs, and indicate how many runs a same test
# failed, and sorted all failed tests by how many runs each test failed in.
#
# This way, when we see failed tests in PreCommit build, we can quickly tell 
# whether a failed test is a new failure or it failed before, and it may just 
# be a flaky test.
#
# Of course, to be 100% sure about the reason of a failed test, closer look 
# at the failed test for the specific run is necessary.
#
