[~agorguy] The test cases in question pass consistently for me locally. They also consistently pass on GitHub [1] and Apache Jenkins [2]. Unless you can tell me what you think is specifically wrong with those test cases and how they should be fixed or improved I see little value in adding anything to the project README concerning those tests

[~olegk] , sorry for the delay, and thank you for or your feedback.

I understand that the test cases are passing consistently for you locally and on the CI. However, I'd like to share the significance of including a minimum specification in the project README. This edition aims to prevent potential flaky test scenarios that may occur for other users or contributors in their machines.

The main goal of our contribution is to educate developers and users about the importance of having a minimum requirement for stable test execution. By specifying the minimum required RAM and CPU in the README, we can avoid unexpected test failures caused by insufficient resources on developers' machines.

Including this information requires minimal effort, yet it can save developers from the frustration of debugging flaky test failures if their machines don't meet the recommended specifications.

 

Thank you for your consideration.

[~agorguy] My point being I rather see efforts spent on analyzing the failing test cases and fixing them, but you are very welcome to submit the information you would like included in BUILDING.txt [1] as as a PR at GitHub

[~olegk], I see your point.

So, I created the PR at GitHub [1]. Let me know if you think something can be improved in the text.
