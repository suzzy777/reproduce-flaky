IMPALA-9296: Move AuxErrorInfo to StatefulStatus

This patch moves AuxErrorInfoPB from FragmentInstanceExecStatusPB to
StatefulStatusPB. This is necessary because if the report with the
AuxErrorInfoPB is dropped (e.g. due to backpressure at the Coordinator
or a flaky network), the next report won't contain the AuxErrorInfoPB,
and the error info will be lost. StatefulStatus solves this by detecting
any reports that may not have been received by the Coordinator, and
re-transmitting any StatefulStatuses that were not successfully
delivered.

This change also makes the setting of AuxErrorInfoPB stateful, so that
the error info only shows up in one report and is then dropped from the
RuntimeState.
