    Ensured `SlaveRegisteredMessage`s trigger appropriate expectations.
    
    An agent may retry `SlaveRegisteredMessage` if it does not receive
    the registration confirmation on time. In this case the confirmation
    may be sent twice. In tests with multiple registering agents, this
    may result that an expectation set for one agent is satisfied by
    a retried confirmation for another agent.
    
    This patch unifies the way how this case is handled. An expectation
    is augmented with a matcher for with the agent pid for which the
    expectation is set.
