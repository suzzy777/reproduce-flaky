PR: [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/682]
 Code: [https://github.com/yifan-c/cassandra/tree/CASSANDRA-15945-verify-sstable-components]
 Test: [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/yifan-c/cassandra]

The patch provides the best-effort verification based on the entries in TOC file to verify the existence of the required {{CompressionInfo}} component, when opening a sstable. 
 If the TOC file does not exist, the verification is a no-op. 
 It only verifies the {{CompressionInfo}} component, because the other components are either mandatory and verified or we rebuild them on opening. Only the compressionInfo is mandatory when compression is enabled but no verification for it in the code base yet. 
 See the table below.

_Mandatory: must present on opening. Optional: can be absent on opening._
||Component||Note||
|DATA|Mandatory. Verified.|
|PRIMARY INDEX|Mandatory (if with validation). Verified.|
|FILTER|Optional. Recreate if needed|
|COMPRESSION INFO|Mandatory if compression enabled. |
|STATS|Mandatory. Verified|
|DIGEST|Optional. |
|CRC|Optional.|
|SUMMARY|Optional.|
|TOC|Optional.|
