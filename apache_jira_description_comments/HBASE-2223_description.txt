We need a nice way of handling long network partitions without impacting a master cluster (which pushes the data). Currently it will just retry over and over again.

I think we could:

 - Stop replication to a slave cluster if it didn't respond for more than 10 minutes
 - Keep track of the duration of the partition
 - When the slave cluster comes back, initiate a MR job like HBASE-2221 

Maybe we want less than 10 minutes, maybe we want this to be all automatic or just the first 2 parts. Discuss.
