Add code coverage tool for the GitHub actions for Java using Jacoco.
(Challenging)

The multiple test are run in parallel and each need to produce a report that need to be uploaded.
Once all are uploaded a new task have to spawn that combine the reports.
I do not currently know of any solution to this problem, making the whole issue a exploratory process of trial and error, and perhaps a different code coverage tool needs to be used.
