Thanks for the contribution [~dionusos]! Can you please create a ReviewBoard review request?

Currently I am getting
{noformat}
fatal: git cat-file: could not get object info 
Line undefined: undefined
{noformat}
I'll try it tomorrow.

[~andras.piros] I managed to upload the diff. Thanks for your time.

I know there are no test cases regarding this change. First I would like to consult the community what is the opinion about this.

[~dionusos] thanks for the contribution!

Leaving my overall opinion on ReviewBoard for the WIP patch.

As the implementation can be a security risk in the software and as I cannot find any other use case than having used hdp.version which is provided by Apache Ambari during Rolling Upgrade (latter cannot be fixed completely by this ticket) I say this ask is invalid and should be closed.
