[~dpavlov], 
 I've moved test {{testClientReconnectClusterDeactivateInProgress}} to separate Jira IGNITE-8352. It has different cause. I don't refuse fixing it I'll take it next. Hope, it's OK

This fix will also relate to:
 {{[3] IgniteStandByClusterSuite: CacheBaselineTopologyTest.testBaselineTopologyChangesFromServer (master fail rate 19,8%)}}

After changes test passing OK:
https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1234140&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_ActivateDeactivateCluster&tab=testsInfo
\\ \\
||Test case||Status||
|testBaselineTopologyChangesFromServer|(/) ~(100 Runs)~|
|testBaselineTopologyChangesFromClient|(/) ~(100 Runs)~|
|testPrimaryLeftAndClusterRestart|(/) ~(100 Runs)~|



Merged to master. 
Thanks for contribution.

[~avinogradov] [~Mmuzaf], thank you for continuing to improve the stability of Ignite tests.
