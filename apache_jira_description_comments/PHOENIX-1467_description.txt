The 4.12 Junit release makes the @Category annotation inheritable. This means we no longer need to annotate each our test classes with category annotations like @Category(NeedsOwnMiniClusterTest.class). 

Test classes that inherit from one of these base test classes - BaseOwnClusterIT, BaseClientManagedTimeIT and BaseHBaseManagedTimeIT will get automatically categorized into @Category(NeedsOwnMiniClusterTest.class), @Category(ClientManagedTimeTest.class) and @Category(HBaseManagedTimeTest.class) respectively.
