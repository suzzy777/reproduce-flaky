Since this is not a blocker issue, as part of the 2.6.0 release process I'm changing the fix version to `2.6.1` and `2.7.0`. If this is incorrect, please respond and discuss on the "[DISCUSS] Apache Kafka 2.6.0 release" discussion mailing list thread.

Since this is not a blocker, there is no active PR  I'm clearing the "fix version" field as part of the 2.7.0 release process.

Failed again.

Failed again.

One more on 3.0.

Failed again with timeout on JDK17: https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka-pr/job/PR-12600/7/testReport/junit/org.apache.kafka.trogdor.coordinator/CoordinatorTest/Build___JDK_17_and_Scala_2_13___testTaskRequestWithOldStartMsGetsUpdated___2/

We merged an attempted fix for this, but it appears that timeouts are still appearing causing the test to flake out. I'll need to investigate further.
