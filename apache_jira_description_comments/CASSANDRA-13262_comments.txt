This is on the Python side, specifically because the results are converted to an OrderedDict ([bin/cqlsh.py#L500|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/bin/cqlsh.py#L500]):
{code}
self.session.row_factory = ordered_dict_factory
{code}

Dictionaries of course don't support duplicate keys. The default row_factory is a named tuple, which also doesn't like duplicate keys, so we have changes to the key names:
{code}
Row(rack=u'rack1', timeout=5000, rack_=u'rack1')
OrderedDict([(u'rack', u'rack1'), (u'timeout', 5000)])
{code}

The simple fix would be explicitly list the values corresponding to each column in [print_static_result()|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/bin/cqlsh.py#L1115]:

{code}
formatted_values = [map(self.myformat_value, [row[c] for c in column_names], cql_types) for row in result.current_rows]
{code}

And that sort of negates the point of using an OrderedDict in the first place.

Sorry for the double upload, there was noise due to some whitespace differences in the previous one.

The provided patch fixes the issue and has been committed as aaf201128764. 
The changes look good to me, but I'm not that familiar with the python driver and cqlsh code to be comfortable enough committing this to anything but trunk. Anyone else, feel free to backport.

Test results: [ [testall|https://builds.apache.org/user/spod/my-views/view/Cassandra%20List%20View/job/Cassandra-devbranch-testall/7/] (clean) | [dtest|https://builds.apache.org/user/spod/my-views/view/Cassandra%20List%20View/job/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/37/#showFailuresLink] (7 flaky) ]

[~spodxx@gmail.com] I have created patches for [v2.2 | ^CASSANDRA-13262-v2.2.txt], [v3.0 | ^CASSANDRA-13262-v3.0.txt] and [v3.11 | ^CASSANDRA-13262-v3.11.txt]. I was unable to reproduced this issue in 2.1, hence no patch was created.

Putting [~Anthony Grasso]'s patches in…

Some nits:
 - in cassandra-3.0_13262 CHANGES should be those merged in from 2.2.x
 - similar in cassandra-3.11

[~Anthony Grasso], the {{cqlsh_tests.cqlsh_tests.TestCqlsh.test_with_empty_values}} failed in the dtest run¹ against the 3.11 patch. (the history of the runs before that has been lost before i got a chance to check it.) Could you take a look at this to see if it's actually caused from the patch? (i would get a chance to before next tuesday.)

It is really unclear from the comments when and where the patch was committed. Only 4.0 appears even if it seems that it should been committed into the 2.2, 3.0 and 3.11 branches.

Can somebody update Fix/versions?

Fix version is correct. See my [previous comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-13262?focusedCommentId=15998605&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15998605]. 

Sorry, [~spodxx@gmail.com] I missed that part. The last comments confused me.

[~mck] what is the status of the patch for the 2.2, 3.0 and 3.11 branches?

[~blerer], the issue was resolved before I addded the comment with anthony's patches. They were never committed because of waiting on the [above comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-13262?focusedCommentId=16015553&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16015553].

Would you like me to go ahead and commit the back-ports? Or run them through the tests again?

[~mck] It would be great if you could run them through the tests again. If it still fails I will look into it.

New dtests running…

EDIT: rebased branches.

[~spodxx@gmail.com], [~blerer], the tests look must better now.  (Still waiting on 3.0 but it looks fine, and those failed against 3.11 and 2.2 are also failed on those branches or known to be flakey.)

Any objections if i commit these backports (and update the 'Fix Versions' accordingly)?

+1 for me. The patches look good. 
[~mck] Thanks for your efforts.

Committed to 2.2, 3.0 and 3.11, with 62e48c5f3f818d1e841178d7365d208435a63537
