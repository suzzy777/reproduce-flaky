The testCoDelScheduling test is broke. Here are some notes on it. I have disabled it in the HBASE-15638 shading patch.

{code}
I don't get this test. When I time this test, the minDelay is > 2 * codel delay from the get go. So we are always overloaded. The test below would seem to complete the queuing of all the CallRunners inside the codel check interval. I don't think we are skipping codel checking. Second, I think this test has been  broken since HBASE-16089 Add on FastPath for CoDel went in. The thread name we were looking for was the name BEFORE we updated: i.e. "RpcServer.CodelBQ.default.handler". But same patch changed the name of the codel  fastpath thread to: new FastPathBalancedQueueRpcExecutor("CodelFPBQ.default", handlerCount, numCallQueues...

Codel is hard to test. This test is going to be flakey given it all timer-based. Disabling for now till chat
