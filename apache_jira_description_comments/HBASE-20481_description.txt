When debugging HBASE-20475, [~openinx] found that the HBaseInterClusterReplicationEndpoint may send the entries for the same regions concurrently, which breaks the serial replication.

As long as we can have multiple ReplicationEndpoint implementation, just fix HBaseInterClusterReplicationEndpoint is not enough, we need to add a setSerial method to ReplicationEndpoint, to tell the implementation that you should keep the order of the entries from the same region.
