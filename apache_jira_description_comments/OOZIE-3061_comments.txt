Thanks for the patch!

Can you apply the same changes in [JavaActionExecutor|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/JavaActionExecutor.java#L1741-L1774] as well?

[~gezapeti] Sure, I attached the patch containing the changes applied to the JavaActionExecuter.

Wouldn't be nicer to check the application state in the YarnClient"s killApplication method?

Yeah, YarnClient could be more clever about this.

Can you upload a cumulative patch that contains changes to both classes in question?
Also, instead of checking against KILLED status I think we should only kill an application if the yarnClient.getFinalApplicationStatus() is UNDEFINED, meaning the application is still running. There is no gain in killing already succeeded/failed applications. 

That makes sense, thanks for pointing out! I have attached a patch for both classes.

[~andras.piros], I try to add some tests as well, should we set the applications external status to KILLED when we dont actually kill them as they are already finished? 

[~matijhs] as I see the patch 005 consists of following parts:
# refactoring {{JavaActionExecutor#kill()}} - doesn't need any new tests
# extending {{LauncherMain#killChildYarnJobs()}} - definitely needs new tests in {{TestLauncherMain}}

Apart from testing perspective, could you please modify the condition in {{LauncherMain#killChildYarnJobs():265}} so that instead of getting only the {{ApplicationReport}} in {{FinalApplicationStatus.UNDEFINED}}, we instead get the one that is not {{SUCCEED}}, {{FAILED}}, or {{KILLED}}? So that we can stay future proof just in case someone extends {{FinalApplicationStatus}} with a new field.

Thanks [~andras.piros], I uploaded a patch according to your comments
