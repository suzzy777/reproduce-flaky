The bug is in the logic for checking if a query has been closed in the shell. We mark the first query as "closed" and subsequent calls to "close" are ignored. Will post a review + test shortly.

    IMPALA-897: shell does not close queries after completion when running from 
    
    The problem was that we were setting a flag marking the last_query_handle as
    were not resetting the flag before the next query. This caused the first que
    be closed properly, but subsequent queries would not be closed. The fix is t
    where the flag is reset to the same place as where we assign last_query_hand
    
    Added a test case.

IMPALA-10249: Fix the flaky TestImpalaShell.test_queries_closed test.

This test for IMPALA-897 is testing that queries run by Impala Shell
from a script file are closed correctly.  This is tested by an assertion
that there is one in-flight query during execution of a script
containing several queries. The test then closes the shell and checks
that there are no in-flight queries. This is the assertion which failed.
Change this assertion to instead wait for the number of in-flight
queries to be zero. This avoids whatever race was causing the flakiness.
