Hopefully this would leverage the SASL server-side support provided by ZOOKEEPER-938. It would be similar to the Java SASL client support also provided in ZOOKEEPER-938.

Java has built-in SASL support, but I'm not sure what C libraries are available for SASL and if so, are they compatible with the Apache license.
