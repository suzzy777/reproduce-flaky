When server nodes are killed one by one IgniteCache.lostPartitions() returns non-empty list up until there is just one node left. When only one node is alive, the lostPartitions() returns an empty collection even though the partition loss events has been fired and the partitions are missing.

This only affects cluster with persistence enabled.
