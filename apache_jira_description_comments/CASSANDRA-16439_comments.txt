Thank you for the patch!

 

+1. I'm not sure if we shouold keep logging statements in the test, but I don't mind them. 

+1 

There are a few unused imports after removing the test in the "CreateTest". I can clean them up while committing. 

+1 from me.  Marked CASSANDRA-16233 as a duplicate of this as it looks like I forgot about replace and this patch fixes it...  =D

Stopped commit so Yifan can do it.
