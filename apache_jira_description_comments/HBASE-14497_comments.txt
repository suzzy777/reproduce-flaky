Sorry for the compiling error. I have fix it and repost patch for master branch.

You're eliminating recursion. Suggest renaming the above variable: e.g. keepSeeking.

+1.

I ran TestHRegion#testReverseScannerStackOverflow:
without fix, StackOverflow was reproduced
with fix, the test passed.

The above two failed tests were seen in other QA runs  
They were not related to the patch. 

Yes, I ran them locally and passed.
So the patch for master branch is OK, right?

I'll attach patch of branch-1 for QA run if there's nothing to do with the master branch patch.

Please attach patch for branch-1

Attach patch for branch-1 for QA run.

Looking at patch v3, is the Boolean variable needed now that you introduced a break statement ?

Actually, it didn't needed. But I think it may help to understanding the code.

Good catch. [~sunyerui]
MemstoreScanner should have the same problem, could you fix it ?
The current solution in patch is good for me.

Thanks

You're right, [~zjushch]. 

I have produced the error on MemstoreScanner, and will fix it with a new version patch today.

Here's the v4 patch for master branch. Also fix the same problem on MemstoreScanner.

[~yuzhihong@gmail.com],[~zjushch], would you please review this? Thanks.

I'll post the patches for branch-1 and 0.98 later, after Hadoop QA run and passed this patch.

I think testEnableTableWithNoRegionServers is not a stable test. 

I ran it several times on branch-1 with git commit 642273bc2a5a415eba6f1592a439a6b2b53a70a9, without this patch. It failed in most times, but indeed succeeded in few times. I settle breakpoints on the entry of seekToPreviousRow of MemstoreScanner&StoreFileScanner, and found that only two calling to seekToPreviousRow for hbase:namespace, one calling return true and another return false, neither called recursively.

 I also ran it with this patch, and got the same result. Most of times the test failed, and succeeded in few times.

 I think there’s another problem in the test, and not related to my patch.

It's somehow weird. 

I have no idea why the zombie test shows trace at TestNameNodeRpcServer, it seems like a trace to start up MiniDFSCluster. And I can't find the really test case in the zombie test traces.

That test was from hdfs test suite - not related.
