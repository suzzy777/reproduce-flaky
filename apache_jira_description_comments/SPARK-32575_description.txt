As reported by [~gurwls223], BlockManagerDecommissionIntegrationSuite test is apparently still flaky (even after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29226): https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29226#issuecomment-670286829.

The new flakyness is because the executors are not launching in the 6 seconds time out I had given them when run under github checks.
