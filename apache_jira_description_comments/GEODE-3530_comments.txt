GEODE-3530: move FlakyTest category to class

* add SuppressWarnings for serial
* organize imports


I added this to the swat label. We want to fix these tests so that they are no longer labeled as flaky.

GEODE-3530: refactor to not use CliCommandTestBase (#2125)

Use the GfshCommandRule and ClusterStarterRule to replace the
CliCommandTestBase in order to make the test less flaky.

* extract rebalance tests to new class

* extract region membership from MBean tests

* extract tests for region membership from MBeans and Function context to
their own class and add more tests

* fix serialization filter and remove eviction rules

* finish extracting tests from GemFireDataCommandsDUnit

GEODE-3530: Refactor LauncherLifecycleCommandsDUnitTest

* extract start locator command tests
* extract status locator tests
* use the GfshCommandRule so that the test is not an acceptance test
* use the ClusterStarterRule to start a locator to help with clean-up
* connect all started locators to the locator
* shutdown the cluster using the locator to clean up all JVMs
* wrap resource creations in try-finally block
* add test for creating dir and cleanup temp files
* ignore the test that requires fewer permissions

Geode 3530 launcher lifecycle server commands (#2267)


* GEODE-3530: Modernize LauncherLifecycleCommandsDUnit

* Extract server start and locator start/stop/status commands into their own
classes
* Remove the CliCommandTestBase
* make locator names match test method names
* add a method for writing classes to a jar file
* add a function to use up all the server's memory for testing
* add max heap property for out of memory test

Make the behavior of the server out of memory test more reliable by
adding a maxheap size (otherwise the size is decided by the JVM)
