There are some old Jiras suggesting that "{{testDecommissionStatus"}} is flaky.
 * HDFS-12188
 * HDFS-9599
 * HDFS-9950
 * HDFS-10755

However, HDFS-14854 fix accidentally commented out one of the checks in {{TestDecommissioningStatus.testDecommissionStatus()"}}. This Jira will restore the commented out code and adds a blocking queue to make the test case deterministic.

My intuition is that monitor task launched by AdminManager may not have enough time to act before we start verifying the status. I suggest the force the main thread to block until the node is added to the blocked node.
