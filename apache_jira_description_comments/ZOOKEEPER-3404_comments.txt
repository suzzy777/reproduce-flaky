I see a big jump in QuorumSSLTest runtime when the Java 9 patch was applied: (trunk JDK8)

[https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum/QuorumSSLTest/history/]

Similar with Java 13:

[https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-java13/94/testReport/org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum/QuorumSSLTest/history/]

and Java 12:

[https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-java12/77/]

Looks like the patch has doubled the test execution time and sometimes it's just not able to finish within the timeout.
