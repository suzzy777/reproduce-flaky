Please see the PR.

[~agura] [~daradurvs] Guys, since you have already looked at the issue, can I ask you to review it? ;) I would like to include the fix into 2.7.5 release.

Looks like failed tests on TC are just flaky tests.

Changes look good to me. [~slava.koptilin] can you take a second look?

[~roman_s] Looks good to me too.

[~agoncharuk] [~agura] Thank you, guys!

I will merge tomorrow if there are no objections (or additions from Vyacheslav's side).
 

I went forward and merged this change! Thank you for fixing this! Also I added check to make sure that test fails more often without this fix.

Thank you, Ilya!

[~roman_s], I'm a bit late :) The fix looks good to me.

One minor comment for future contributions: related to test, there is no need to define static field {{TcpDiscoveryVmIpFinder(true)}} directly since it's set by default in abstract class.

Thanks for your contributions!
