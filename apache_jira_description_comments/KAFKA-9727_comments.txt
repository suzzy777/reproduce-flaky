abbccdda commented on pull request #8307: KAFKA-9727: cleanup the state store for standby task dirty close and check null for changelogs
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8307
 
 
   This PR fixes two things:
   
   1. the EOS standby task should also wipe out state under dirty close
   2. the changelog reader should check for null as well
   
   The sequence to reproduce the system test failure:
   
   1. Stream job close uncleanly, leaving active task 0_0 no committed offset
   2. The task 0_0 switch from active to standby task, which never logs anything in checkpoint under EOS
   3. Task 0_0 gets illegal state for not finding checkpoints, throwing task corrupted exception
   4. Exception were caught and the task was closed, however the state store was already registered
   5. Next iteration we shall hit lock not available as it never gets released.
   6. We shall also hit a NPE in the changelog removal as well since it never gets registered.
