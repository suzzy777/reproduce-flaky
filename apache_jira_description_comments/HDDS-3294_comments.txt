Thanks to report it. I have seen other intermittent failure (without the NPE) which may or may not related. I uploaded the log and disabled the test.

Thanks [~elek]. I believe the intermittent NPE might be related to insufficient wait/check in the test code. Haven't looked thoroughly into it.

Note this test class is disabled (ignored) now.

The test has been enabled and marked as flaky in HDDS-6095.  Haven't seen any failure since then.  Also passed 300x:
