I know [~mjacobs] is at a conference, but so far this has happened once. We can reconsider assignee if this causes more pain.

This same failure occurred in data load on 9/29: http://sandbox.jenkins.sf.cloudera.com/view/Impala/view/Evergreen-asf-master/job/impala-asf-master-core-data-load/86/testReport/junit/(root)/KuduScanNodeTest/TestLimitsAreEnforced/

Marking as build blocker



Turns out this test is flaky. If the scanner threads (there are 2 in this case) return a batch from the latter range (starting at id 5) first, the test fails. Marcel had previously suggested removing these tests since they are hard to maintain and we don't have BE unit tests for other scan nodes. Now that we have functional EE tests in place for Kudu, I think we can remove them.

    IMPALA-4204: Remove KuduScanNodeTest
    
    In IMPALA-4204, the limit test could fail depending on the
    timing of the scanner threads.
    
    Now that we have functional tests for Kudu (IMPALA-3718), we
    can remove the BE KuduScanNode tests which have been error
    prone and haven't been any new bugs. Also, we don't have BE
    tests for any other scan nodes.
