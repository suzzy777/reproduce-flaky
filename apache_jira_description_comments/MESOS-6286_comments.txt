This problem has also been observed when the agent is stuck in recovery for an extended period of time, e.g., because a container has gotten into some weird state.

The simplest fix here might be to simply change the agent to not respond to {{PingSlaveMessage}} is the agent is not in the {{RUNNING}} state. With that change, an agent that is stuck in recovery indefinitely will eventually fail health checks; the framework will then receive {{TASK_LOST}} / {{TASK_UNREACHABLE}} status updates for any tasks on the agent, and can decide if/when to relaunch that work elsewhere. If the agent later finishes recovery, it will be allowed to re-register -- as normal, non-partition-aware tasks on the agent will be terminated and partition-aware tasks will be allowed to keep running. Any failed containers will be reported as terminal to the framework.

There should probably also be a mechanism to detect situations in which the agent fails to startup for an extended period, so that the operator can investigate the state of the agent. But that seems orthogonal to this issue.

Talking with [~vinodkone], the scheme described above is simple, but has a drawback: if recovering the agent state takes longer than the master's health check timeout (75 seconds by default), the agent will be marked LOST. Extended agent recovery times can be more common than you'd think because this code path hasn't been optimized: e.g., the agent re-reads the metadata for all executors (including completed ones), which might be in the 1000s.

An alternative would be to reuse the {{agent_reregister_timeout}} flag. If the master notices that the master -> agent socket has broken, it will start a timer with duration {{agent_reregister_timeout}}; if the timer expires before the agent has re-registered, the master marks the agent lost/unreachable. That would give the agent 10 minutes (by default) to finish recovery before being marked unreachable.

commit 03f16d221dfab6e5d96a962491fac91a50d8a446

    Improved handling of agents that restart but never re-register.
    
    The master expected that if an agent responds to pings, it will
    (eventually) register or re-register. However, if the agent hangs during
    recovery, that assumption does not hold: the agent will continue to
    respond to pings but won't attempt to re-register until recovery
    finishes.
    
    To handle this case, the master now expects an agent to re-register
    within `agent_reregister_timeout` if the master -> agent socket breaks;
    if no re-registration is seen, the master will mark the agent
    unreachable. This is a "backup" to handle the case where recovery hangs,
    as explained above; more commonly, the agent will re-register (when it
    receives a ping and notices the master believes it is disconnected) or
    be marked unreachable because it fails to respond to pings.

    Improved OneWayPartitionTest.MasterToSlave.
    
    Fix theoretical test flakiness (unlikely to be a problem in practice),
    add more test expections, and cleanup code.
