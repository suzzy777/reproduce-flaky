[~tlipcon] traced the error down to the TlsSocket::Writev() implementation: the method transparently returned Status::NetworkError() with EINTR error code to the caller even in case of partially successful write.

As a side note, the issue was gone if enabling the SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE mode for TlsContext.

Overall, we might consider enabling the partial write mode for TLS to make {{TlsSocket::Write()}} behave like {{Socket::Write()}}.

[~aserbin] do you think we should backport this to earlier branches as well? (along with the other WANT_RETRY-related fix?)

[~tlipcon] yes, I think it's a good idea to port those -- it could address some issues which went unreported.  At least, it would not hurt if we backported this and 18e024cf8bcaea192efb63780802cc4c799bbb9c to earlier branches .  I'll post the patches for review in a few minutes.

The patches for back-porting those two fixes into branch-1.[3-5].x branches are ready for review:
