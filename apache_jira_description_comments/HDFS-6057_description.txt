Running the tip of {{branch-2.4}}, I'm observing some zombie processes in my environment.  jstack shows the following thread preventing the JVM from shutting down:

{noformat}
"Thread-3" prio=10 tid=0x00007f0a908a5800 nid=0x3ee9 runnable [0x00007f0a89471000]
   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE
	at org.apache.hadoop.net.unix.DomainSocketWatcher.doPoll0(Native Method)
	at org.apache.hadoop.net.unix.DomainSocketWatcher.access$800(DomainSocketWatcher.java:52)
	at org.apache.hadoop.net.unix.DomainSocketWatcher$1.run(DomainSocketWatcher.java:455)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:679)
{noformat}

Marking the {{DomainSocketWatcher.watcherThread}} as a daemon thread would prevent this situation.  Is there any reason it isn't classified as such?

Also, tracing through the code, I don't see any code path where {{DomainSocketWatcher.close()}} is invoked (though this would seem to be a larger issue -- maybe I'm missing something...).
