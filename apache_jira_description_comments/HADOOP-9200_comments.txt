This message is automatically generated.

The patch verification seems to be failed because org.apache.hadoop.ha.TestZKFailoverController is a flaky test.
The patch does not seem to affect this test anyhow.

Review comments:
* TestNetGroupCaching.java : it needs the license header
* A change made in NetgroupCache.java may expose a new problem. Details follow.
* Don't forget to add a timeout to the test cases that are new or modified.

   /**
{code}

In the current code, netgroupToUsersMap is not cleared, so a user's loss of membership to a group or removal of a user will not take effect. So above change seems necessary. But since refresh() is not atomic, requests made during rebuilding of the data structures may incorrectly result in an access violation.  We could make cacheGroupsRefresh() and calls to NetgroupCache.getNetgroups() synchronized to solve this problem, but it will be better if refresh happens in background and the new mapping is swapped in as a last step of refresh, so that getGroups() calls are not blocked while refresh is going on. 

I will file a separate jira to fix NetgroupCache implementation.

I've created HADOOP-9436. I will post a patch with a basic test.

Hi, Kihval, 
I'm attaching a new version of the patch where I have rewritten the implementation of NetgroupCache class. Please review it.
I believe, now the data access problems are solved without any blocking.

I see that you already fixed H-9436, so now we probably need to choose which fix is better or merge them somehow.
