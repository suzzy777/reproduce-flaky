cc: [~udim] since the PR was also merged to the 2.18.0 release branch  

Robert, could you please check whether the flake cause is in the test code or in the SDK itself? Setting fix version to 2.18.0 out of caution in case another change for release branch will be required due to this error. 

Please remove the fix version tag if not release-blocking.

These errors continue to happen. I see that [~iemejia] removed 2.18.0 fix version tag. The flake was introduced by a PR that was cherry-picked into the release branch. Are we confident that this flake does not need to be fixed in the release branch?

If I removed the tag probably it was because I misread that this was part of master aka 2.19.0. I was not aware of the cherry pick so putting the version back looks like the good thing to do.

What is the next action here with respect to 2.18 release?
 * Revert the cherry pick to release branch?
 * Fix forward in the release branch? Do we know what is the fix?
 * Leave it as it its? – Is this just a test flakiness? Would this affect end users?

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10389 has been merged. 

This is mostly a testing issue--on a loaded machine the log writing thread might not start up before the test tries to close it. (It was a race with the pre-existing test as well but that generally did "enough work" to make the failure rarer.)

The only way this could affect a real worker is if it was brought up and shut down very quickly (as in quicker than opening up the grpc channel to get work). I don't think it's worth the overhead of a cherry-pick. 

Thanks, everyone. We can reopen if this comes up again.
