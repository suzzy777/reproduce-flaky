[~nobigo] I'll try to review it this week.

[~nobigo], According to the [stackoverflow link|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52547306/maven-javadoc-plugin-not-accepting-additionalparam-xdoclintnone-additionalpa] you have shared, the javadoc generation should fail because of this issue, but {{mvn javadoc:javadoc }}succeeds.
