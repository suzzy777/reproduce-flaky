Scheduled CI run builds and tests Ozone {{master}} branch twice daily.  It was useful earlier to get additional data points about flaky tests.  I don't think it's needed any longer, as we have more PR/commit activity.  For any flaky test we can more simply trigger repeated runs in our own fork, without wasting Apache resources.

So I propose retiring the scheduled CI run.
