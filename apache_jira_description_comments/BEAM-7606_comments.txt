[~iemejia] can you please point me to the broken build? I am still new to contributing so I am not quite sure how to go about finding failed runs.

If you run the build in master with this command `./gradlew :sdks:java:io:jdbc:check` you can easily reproduce the issue. I cross confirmed in the Beam slack channel and other people also noticed the build broken.

{{testBeamRowMapper_datetime}}
{{java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<Row:[2019-05-24T00:00:00.000Z, 1970-01-01T17:41:50.000Z, 2019-05-24T17:41:50.000Z, 2019-05-24T17:41:50.000Z]> but was:<Row:[2019-05-24T00:00:00.000Z, 1970-01-01T18:41:50.000Z, 2019-05-24T17:41:50.000Z, 2019-05-24T17:41:50.000Z]> at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89) at org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:835) at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:120) at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:146) at org.apache.beam.sdk.io.jdbc.SchemaUtilTest.testBeamRowMapper_datetime(SchemaUtilTest.java:255) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)}}

It would be probably a good idea to rename that method too use Java casing style too: `{{testBeamRowMapperDatetime`}}

[~kedin] for info: marked it as Fix version 2.14.0 because this is breaking the tests in the release branch too and the fix should be cherry picked.

This is probably flaky because JDBC date/time values operate on local time. The timezone of the user who runs the tests affects the outcome. I have pushed a patch that should fix it but given that even the old tests passed on my machine and on Jenkins, I might need your help to verify that it indeed works everywhere.
