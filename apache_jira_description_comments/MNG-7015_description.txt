[~mthmulders] or [~MartinKanters], please have a look at this and tell me what you think:

* Clone both Maven and Core ITs from branch {{MNG-6169/MNG-6551}}, run its and what MNG-5760 fail.

I have uploaded both log files.
For some strange reason a different set of modules is excluded in both cases. I don't understand why.
