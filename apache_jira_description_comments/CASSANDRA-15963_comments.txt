So far this error has not reproduced for me, but the test is flaky having a different exception at teardown:

Apparently Zhao has already fixed this. I linked the duplicate ticket, which merged Sept 10. There are no failures in [ci-cassandra|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/10/testReport/dtest.repair_tests.repair_test/TestRepair/test_dead_sync_initiator/history/] since then.

Passing along for review this [one-liner|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/compare/master...aholmberg:CASSANDRA-15963?expand=1] updating the test for the error above.

The error is expected, and caused when the [socket is closed|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/net/AsyncStreamingInputPlus.java#L133] and the [handler|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/streaming/async/StreamingInboundHandler.java#L205] has not been associated with a session yet. The message text is new for 4.0, but had not been added to the allow list yet.

Committed, thanks.

Thanks for the analysis, Adam. Sounds like we could close the ticket as a dup?
