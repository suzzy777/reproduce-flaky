Some tests are flaky because of minimal data size differences, e.g., one byte. However, many times we do not actually care about these differences. One example is {{default_constraint.q}}.

Patch adds the possibility to mask 1) printing of stats selectively on q files by adding the {{-- MASK_STATS}} option, and 2) printing of data size stats selectively on q files by adding the {{-- MASK_DATA_SIZE}} option.
