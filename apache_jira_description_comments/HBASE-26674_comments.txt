[~elserj] [~wchevreuil] [~bszabolcs] FYI. Maybe also related to HBASE-26271?

Thanks, Duo. I would guess the same root cause as HBASE-26644. I think I had tried to revert HBASE-26271 to see if that addressed the issue. I'll try to dig into this next week.

I've filed HBASE-26675 for a possible race condition introduced by HBASE-26271 but after reviewing the related code, I do not think this issue is introduced by HBASE-26271.

In the current code base, when completing a compaction, we will not hold the filesCompacting lock, so it is possible that, in the compaction selection code, the filesCompacting and SFM.getStorefiles do not match, then it will generate the exception above.

Let me dig more on the old implemention vs. new implementation, to see how can we fix this problem.

Thanks.

OK, so in the old implementation, we hold the writeLock while updating filesCompacting in replaceStoreFiles, but in the new implementation, since we do not want to hold the write lock while modifying SFT, we move the lock inside StoreEngine, so now, we will not hold writeLock while updating filesCompacting, which introduce the problem.

Let me think how to fix this.

Pushed to master and branch-2.

Thanks [~elserj] for reviewing!
