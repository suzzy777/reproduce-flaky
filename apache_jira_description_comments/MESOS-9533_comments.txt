    Fixed a test flakiness in ROOT_CleanupAfterReboot.
    
    Review: https://reviews.apache.org/r/69809

I've reopened this because I have observed the same failure on the {{1.7.x}} branch. I've also set up fix versions to match those in MESOS-9518 since I suppose that are the branches where the test have been back introduced.

yea, did not realize the test was backported. I will backport the fix now

Done with backporting:
