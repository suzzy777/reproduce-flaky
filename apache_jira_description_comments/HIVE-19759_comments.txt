[~pvary] could you take a look?

Hi [~stakiar],

We struggle with a very similar situation when starting the MetaStore. See: {{MetaStoreUtils.findFreePort()}}. I think using {{new ServerSocket(0)}} makes it more reliable. Still we need the retry logic, since if two tests runs on the same drone we might end up using conflicting ports anyway.
Nit: You might want to use a constant for the RETRY_COUNT instead of simply writing 10

Otherwise LGTM.

Thanks,
Peter

Thanks for taking a look [~pvary]. Updated the patch with a constant for the retry count.

Doesn't {{MetaStoreUtils.findFreePort()}} technically have a race condition; it first finds the free port and then closes the socket bound to that port, which means another process could acquire it before the metastore binds to it.

[~stakiar]: You are right about the race condition - that is why the retry is required as well, but using the same hard coded {{expectedPort}} has the same issue and some more :)

[~pvary] makes sense. Attached updated patch that uses the same method as {{MetaStoreUtils.findFreePort}} - didn't use to the class directly as there is no dependency between {{spark-client}} and {{standalone-metastore}}. Created a version of {{findFreePort}} in the {{common}} module.

[~stakiar]: Is {{standalone-metastore}} dependent on the {{common}} module? If so, we might want to change the original  {{findFreePort}} calls to use the new one. We can do it in a follow-up jira if you agree.

It shouldn't be. I think the {{standalone-metastore}} is meant to have no Hive dependencies.

Thanks for the info!
