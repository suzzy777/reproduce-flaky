Hey [~jmakai] 

Can you please share more details on how your change solves the flaky test issue?

Thank you

Sure, Dénes.

During my investigation, I've found that if we use the queue() method for launching callables, then we do not have much control over the execution and outcome of them, and it could be different on different machines so it's safe to say that it's not deterministic.
However, queueSerial() can be used instead in order to achieve deterministic outcome, which then leads to eliminating the flakiness of the test.

Furthermore, I've made several testing locally to prove this.

I hope this helped you to understand the nature of this issue and feel free to ask if something is not clear.
