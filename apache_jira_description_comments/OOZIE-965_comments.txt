Removed trailing spaces

The failed tests look unrelated and some of them also fail without the patch.

The failed tests were: 
{code}org.apache.oozie.service.TestRecoveryService.testCoordActionRecoveryServiceForSuspended
org.apache.oozie.service.TestStatusTransitService.testBundleStatusTransitServiceRunningWithError
org.apache.oozie.service.TestStatusTransitService.testBundleStatusTransitServiceKilled
org.apache.oozie.service.TestStatusTransitService.testBundleStatusTransitServiceSucceeded3{code}
These fail on trunk without my patch.  

The erred tests were: 
{code}org.apache.oozie.command.wf.TestLastModified.testWorkflowRun
org.apache.oozie.executor.jpa.TestCoordActionGetByLastModifiedTimeJPAExecutor.testCoordActionGet{code}
I'll look into these two.  

Those two erred tests work fine when run in both mac and ubuntu with and without the patch; so it looks like it might be a different issue and/or these tests might be flaky.  I'll open a JIRA for them.  

+1

Thanks Robert. Committed to trunk.

Closing issue as it has been released as part of 3.3.0 release
