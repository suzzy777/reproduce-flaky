We currently have a situation where we need to create an IndexContext that is for a non-indexed column and therefore is never going to be used for indexing or searching. This results in the IndexContext having to check for this at points in the code with assertions. The reason for this that, even when the column is non-indexed, we need to have information about the column for the purpose of post-filtering. 

It would make sense to split out the column / index information needed for filtering from the indexing / searching requirements such that we could avoid unnecessary assertions in the code.
