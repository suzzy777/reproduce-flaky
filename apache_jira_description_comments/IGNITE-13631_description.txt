||Metric||Description||Comment||
|*WalLoggingRate*|Average number of WAL records per second written during the last time interval.|The "time interval" part is unclear. Which time interval?|
|*WalFsyncTimeDuration*|Total duration of fsync|Why not just *WalFsyncDuration*?
The description could be more verbose.|
|*WalFsyncTimeNum*|Total count of fsync|Why not just *WalFsyncNum*? The description could be more verbose|
|*WalBuffPollSpinsRate*|WAL buffer poll spins number over the last time interval. |Over which time interval?|
|*LastCheckpointMarkDuration*|Duration of the checkpoint lock wait in milliseconds |The description doesn't match the name.|
|*CheckpointTotalTime*|Total duration of checkpoint|Is it the duration of the last checkpoint or all checkpoints from the beginning?|

|*WalTotalSize*|Total size in bytes for storage wal files.|WAL should be capital. The grammar|
