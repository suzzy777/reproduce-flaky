The test is essentially a copy of testBasic except with an extra log existence assertion at the end. This would indicate a flake with the test infrastructure. Looks like this is the first flake for the test, so maybe it's related a recent change? The three most recent changes in the Dataflow worker are the following, with the first two being related to streaming:

Is the other test (testBasic) also flaky?

/cc [~kenn] - related to the comment that this might be an infra flake.

Looking at the code, the test puts a 0 as the timestamp for each work. Maybe that makes it susceptible to flaking? I'll add in the timestamp and check it in.
