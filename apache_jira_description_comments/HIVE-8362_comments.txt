Ran it several times - sometimes I got this diff:

Looked into it and found sometimes the test failed with extra info in parallel.q.out (other than that Chao mentioned):

This is caused by the clean up script: data/scripts/q_test_cleanup.sql
We need to make sure the output of this cleanup script won't be dumpped into parallel.q.out.


Interesting. So sometimes the q_test_cleanup.sql output is being written to the .q.out file?

[~jxiang], the randomness of the output for this test is probably caused by the concurrency issue in collecting linage info in move tasks.  Option hive.exec.parallel previously didn't apply to move tasks but now it does (HIVE-8042). As a result, multiple move tasks can collect linage info concurrently, accessing shared variable without synchronization.


Thanks [~xuefuz] for the hint. I attached a patch that seems to have fixed the flakiness in test prarallel.q.

This problem seems to be applicable to trunk as well. I'm going to make the bug on trunk instead.

+1 pending on test.

[~jxiang], I reattached your patch for testing in trunk, but could you check if you patch can be applied to trunk as I wasn't sure. Thanks.

I need to post a new patch for trunk since the parallel.q.out for spark is not in trunk yet. Let me do it now.

Attached the patch for trunk.

Attache HIVE-8362.3.patch that removed the change to QTestUtil.java, which caused multi_insert.q failure. We can fix the extra cleanup script output in a separate issue.

Thank you Jimmy for fixing this long standing issue! I have committed it to trunk!
