[~kaysoky] FYI

This test is flaky because it is reading the contents of the {{stdout}} file and expecting a certain size (with some amount of leeway).  It looks like it can fail when the executor logs slightly more (~1 KB) more text than expected.

We can fix this by either: 
1) silencing the executor's logging with an environment variable ({{MESOS_LOGGING_LEVEL=ERROR}}); or
2) increasing the amount of leeway the test can tolerate (https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/b2101157fd61bbe42c9536935ee9fda44a929ee9/src/tests/container_logger_tests.cpp#L505).

I'd opt for silencing the executor's logging, because it is a bit more precise.

This same failure mode was observed again yesterday on ASF CI.
