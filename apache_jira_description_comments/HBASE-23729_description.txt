Asserts a dead server but the dead server can be cleaned up because the ServerCrashProcedure completes before the assert can run.

Fails for me locally nearly every time I run it.

In flakies list, it shows as failing 55% of the time: https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-2/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dashboard.html
