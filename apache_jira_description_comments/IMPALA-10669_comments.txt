Workaround idea: give less memory to the initial build container (performing Impala build and dataload) than the complete machine.
DAtaload runs with no problems on an r5.4xlarge with 128GB RAM, so let's try that. Use "-m 128g" to create the build container.

I also ran into this in https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-dockerised-tests/5829/.

I think the container referenced here is something in the JVM. Maybe managed by yarn or some other task manager? Currently going off what I can infer from https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Support-Questions/Analyze-table-commands-not-working-in-CDP/m-p/318924 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-15906.

I think this is a duplicate of IMPALA-10316.

IMPALA-10316: Increase Yarn minimum container size for dataload

This is an attempt to get rod of IMPALA-10669 and friends, crashing Tez
containers during the loading of nested ORC data.

The usual error message logged for these failures is:

Container [pid=11530,containerID=container_1618776748992_0039_01_000003]
is running 2785280B beyond the 'PHYSICAL' memory limit.
Current usage: 1.0 GB of 1 GB physical memory used; 2.6 GB of 2.1 GB
virtual memory used. Killing container.

https://stackoverflow.com/a/43827548/143681 explains that the tunable
setting 'yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb' in yarn-site.xml sets
both the minimum memory size and the memory size increment for Yarn
containers

This patch is an attempt to work around the failure by forcibly setting
a minimum size for the Yarn containers used in dataload that is
significantly larger than the 1 GB size reported in the failure messages.

Tested by running the dataload phase successfully on the following
platform combinations:
- Ubuntu 16.04, m6i.8xlarge (128 GB RAM, Docker)
- Ubuntu 16.04, m5.12xlarge (192 GB RAM, Docker)
- Centos 7.4, m5.4xlarge (64 GB RAM)
- Centos 7.4, r5.4xlarge (128 GB RAM)
- Ubuntu 16.04, m6i.4xlarge (64 GB RAM)
