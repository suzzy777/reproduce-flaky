Goal : Provide an extension library to compute approximate statistics on streams.

Interest : Probabilistic data structures can create an approximation (sketch) of the current state of a stream without storing every element but rather processing each observation quickly to summarize its current state and find useful statistical insights.

Implementation is here : https://github.com/ArnaudFnr/beam/tree/sketching/sdks/java/extensions/sketching
