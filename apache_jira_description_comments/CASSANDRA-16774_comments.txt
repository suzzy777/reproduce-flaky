tests look clean, only the two tests in this ticket are failing (as expected, they only pass when the race condition happens, which I just fixed); updating python dtests now

pushed python dtests and updated the CI to run against it

+1 (local dtest changes against your branch are green for me across a few runs)

I bet this was the problem with CASSANDRA-16526 too.

looking at the test I feel more is going on as well.

* BinLog is async and max size is only used by the archiver, which is triggered on release (I don't see how we control it)
* max weight is 10, and our records don't override weight, so 1 record = 1 weight; aka max queue size of 10 records
* test is waiting until a log exists which has 2 records... but 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are all valid states

Unless I am missing something, org.apache.cassandra.utils.binlog.BinLogTest#flakyTestTruncationReleasesLogSpace doesn't make sense to me. The test would make more sense if it controlled the archiver and wrote 11 records, you can then detect release got triggered and then the log size should be 1

But to your point, since stop doesn't release the resources the files cleanup when GC triggered, so previous tests may have other log files in the test directory

+1

Hi,

I have been bisecting a bit and I think recent 4.0.0 [failures|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-4.0.0/44/] and due to this ticket? Could sbdy familiar with it confirm please?

Thx in advance

[~bereng] I think you are correct. The simplest fix is probably just to make sure that the two line change from [this commit|https://github.com/dcapwell/cassandra/commit/f0a7ea411fe237543200b3c67a2f0fb34536c162] ends up in 4.0.0 instead of just 4.0. Seems like a reasonable candidate for a ninja-fix.

[~bereng] [~marcuse] [~e.dimitrova] [~jmeredithco] [~dcapwell] Here is a small patch to back-port the change to {{cassandra-4.0.0}} (with a Jenkins run in progress):

[branch|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1102], [Jenkins|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/897/]

+1, change looks good pending tests.

Tests [look good|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/897/], outside what appear to be 3 entirely unrelated failures.

[~edimitrova] [~bereng] Any idea if the failure in [UnableToParseClientMessageTest|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/897/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test/UnableToParseClientMessageTest/badHeader_version_4_v4_/] is new. That's the only one I didn't find a Jira for.

I haven't seen it before. It doesn't fail for me locally in 4.0.0. Considering that the failing assert is based on a grep in the logs, I would say probably there is some test flakiness somewhere and we should improve the test... I can take a look these days. This failing test doesn't exercise the code you changed

The failures are unrelated. And that {{UnableToParseClientMessageTest}} I'd swear I've seen before. So I think we're good to merge imo. +1

4.0.0 back-port committed as https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/68bf950f72d20be9f31fd3f91669be7e28c050e4

(Also changed release to 4.0-rc3.)

Thanks everyone!
