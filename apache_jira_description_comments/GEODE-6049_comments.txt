Failed test link: https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/teams/main/pipelines/apache-develop-main/jobs/IntegrationTestOpenJDK8/builds/110

I have run the test thousands of times in Intellij and all runs passed. I think we hit a flaky test possibly due to running ci concourse on shared vms.

Test does the following and it failed as the get load does not finish in 1 second for 100 get/load.
config = new GemFireHealthConfigImpl(null);
    config.setMaxLoadTime(10);
    eval = new CacheHealthEvaluator(config, this.system.getDistributionManager());
    eval.evaluate(status);

    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      region.get("Test2 " + i);
    }
    assertTrue(System.currentTimeMillis() - start < 1000);

This is like performance test in the unit test. If there are heavy usage by others, this kind of tests would be impacted. 
If we do not hit this issue consistently, we may just keep this test around. Rerun of the test should get the test to pass. If it fails more frequently, we may need to remove this test from the unit test suite.
