Hopefully this commit will remove the flakiness. If not I'll reopen.

  IMPALA-6100: increase test_exchange_delays timeout on slow builds

The timeout is doubled on build types known to be slow to reduce the
odds of hitting the flakiness.

Testing:
I wasn't able to reproduce the original problem locally. However I was
able to reproduce a similar problem by decreasing the timeout to 2000ms,
which suggests that > 1s hiccups are possible with an ASAN build, so
increasing the timeout could help.

This has happened again on a Jenkins ASAN build (at git hash 98490925cb0dc05e46c437ea3b88fbd1f02b8f52, which includes the previous fix)

I need to investigate further, but it seems like the build type detection logic may have started failing silently at some point for ASAN.

I think the regression here was because we weren't detecting hte ASAN build correctly. The below commit should fix that.

IMPALA-6241: timeout in admission control test under ASAN

The fix for IMPALA-6241 is to increase the timeout for all slow builds.

While testing that fix, I discovered that the ASAN build detection logic
was failing silently, resulting in it assuming that it was testing a
DEBUG build. The error was:

  Unexpected DW_AT_name in first CU:
  /data/jenkins/workspace/verify-impala-toolchain-package-build/label/ec2-package-ubuntu-16-04/toolchain/source/llvm/llvm-3.9.1.src/projects/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_preinit.cc;
  choosing DEBUG

The fix for that issue is to remove the build type detection heuristic
and instead just write a file with the build type as part of the build process.

Testing:
Before this change I was able to reproduce locally every 5-10 test
iterations. After this change I haven't seen it reproduce.
