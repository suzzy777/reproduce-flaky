   - adjusts parameter alpha in GradientDescentUtilsTest from `0.00002` to `0.00001`
   - aforementioned param change results in stable convergence, checked via RepeatedTest (JUnit)
   - optimizes how random values are obtained in `GradientDescentUtils`
   - fixes a potentially unpredictable BigDecimal value in `AnomalyDetectionUtils` (see JavaDoc of that constructor)

   @jzonthemtn Could you create a new unreleased version in Jira? I'm lacking a projected fix version upon closing issues, atm.
   
   Maybe, we could have a 2.1.2 and/or a 2.2.0 as this one might open up sooner or later.

   Huh, I just checked the `OPENNLP` project on JIRA and I do not see the option to "Manage Versions" (as I see on Jena & Commons). I might be missing some karma on JIRAâ€¦ will try to check if I need to request to INFRA or if I'm missing updating some SVN fileâ€¦ sorry.
