Attach a patch that adds the new values to the HDFS thrift API, and it generates all thrift files using:

# mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pthriftif -Dthrift.home=/usr/local

Would it make sense to exclude any files which only have date change? 

[~spena] Can you post just the changes in the .thrift files here as well for the reference? The patch is pretty big and auto-generated so it isn't very interesting.

[~akolb] I identify another thing on this patch. and it will require changes on the API that is used on SENTRY-1781. Could you review SENTRY-1781 first?

These are flaky tests. I run them locally without the patch, and they're failing too. Also,  MVN run them several times, and it found they're flaky.
