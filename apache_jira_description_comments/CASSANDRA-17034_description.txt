Pluggable memtable API as described in [CEP-11|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-11%3A+Pluggable+memtable+implementations].

Â 

Initial version is already available in [this branch|https://github.com/datastax/cassandra/tree/memtable-api], and needs to be updated to the changes in trunk. Two additional features suggested by CEP reviewers are also to be implemented:
 * Sharding support: extending the memtable owner interface to supply suitable shard boundaries that split the owned token space and are in agreement with disk boundaries.
 * Shared read API with sstables: defining a common interface for reading partitions from memtables and sstables; this is to include filters to avoid unnecessary copying.
