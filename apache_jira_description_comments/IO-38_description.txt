I tested IO 1.2-RC2 on both Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

On Windows XP using JDK 1.4.2_05 running the tests using maven and ant(1.6.1) 
both passed with no problems. Using JDK 1.3.1_04 with maven the tests passed, 
but with ant(1.6.1) the JUnit failed with a NoClassDefFoundError for 
org.w3c.dom.Node.

On Windows 2000 using JDK 1.4.2_07 the tests failed using both maven and ant
(1.6.1)
