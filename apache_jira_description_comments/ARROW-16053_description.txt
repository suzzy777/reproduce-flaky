'status' failed with IOError: Could not write record batch to stream (server disconnect?). Detail: Internal
C:/projects/arrow/cpp/src/arrow/flight/client.cc:362: Close() failed: IOError: gRPC returned unauthenticated error, with message: Invalid token. Detail: Unauthenticated. gRPC client debug context: {"created":"@1648486690.229000000","description":"Error received from peer ipv6:[::1]:2265","file":"D:\bld\grpc-cpp_1646464801475\work\src\core\lib\surface\call.cc","file_line":904,"grpc_message":"Invalid token.

Depending on whether gRPC queues the write or not, the write call may or may not fail (or it may fail with an unexpected error), we need to account for these cases.
