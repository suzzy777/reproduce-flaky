left comments in PR.

Overall LGTM.  I plan to run the property test a few times locally to make sure it doesn't fail later.

Ran the test with 
{code}
.withExamples(50_000_000)
{code}

just to make sure this was stable (ran with higher but qt memory became the issue).

All comments in GitHub are not blocking but would be good to address.

Any update?  Looking for a second reviewer?

committed, rebased and updated to use nodetool; synced with Chris offline to make sure he was good with the changes.
