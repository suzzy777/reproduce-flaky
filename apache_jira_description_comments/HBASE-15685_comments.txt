Do you have a patch? 

[~enis], Hi Enis, I am new to open source and even version control. I am carefully reading the documentation right now, looks like I need to fork the HBase project and make the modification there, then I will send a request to you and the other committers right?

I have added 6 occurrences where it is missing a forward slash between port and table

patch available 

[~enis] Hi Enis, this is the first time I ever contribute to open source project, I tried to run `mvn clean site` at the home folder of HBase to make sure my tiny tiny documentation modification won't negatively impact the build, however, it did. I doubt it is my change lead to that but the development environment on my Ubuntu VM that screwed it up. [Here|https://datafireball.com/2016/04/22/hbase-contribution/] is a more detail blog I wrote yesterday regarding my first experience. Let me know what you think and maybe you can review my patch too. 

The patch is available and passed the mvn site test, please review when you can. Thanks!

Thanks for the patch [~biwa7636]. We have a background process (called hadoopqa) that should have picked up the patch and run the standard tests on it. Let me reattach the patch to trigger it. I'll commit once it gets back.

Hi Hudson, can you help educate me what does this error mean? external_apis.adoc is the indeed the only file that I was editing. BTW, which command you ran to produce this error so I can DIY next time before I attach a patch. 

Hi Bin. Hudson is the user for our automated (previously Hudson, now Jenkins based) CI system. It does a full build and runs the tests post commit. It is failing due to a couple of flaky tests that we are trying to clean up. You do not need to worry about it.
