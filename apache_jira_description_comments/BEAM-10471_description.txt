{{AssertionError}} with no error message. Please give a meaningful error message. Preferably do not use {{assertTrue}} and other less meaningful asserters.

Digging into the code, it is a bounds check that the estimated bytes are +/- 10% of expected, since the result is nondeterministic. It fell outside of the range but since the assertion is written as {{assertTrue}} we do not see the actual value.
