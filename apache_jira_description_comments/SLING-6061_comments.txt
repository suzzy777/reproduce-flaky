* Committed a initial version of the script in https://svn.apache.org/r1762420 .
* Linked this to a Jenkins job named https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/Sling/job/sling-seed-build/

This job has generated two jobs (for now, more will be added later)

* https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/Sling/job/sling-bundles-extensions-i18n/
* https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/Sling/job/sling-contrib-extensions-sling-pipes/

If these jobs work fine then I'll need to find a way to exclude them from their 'reactor' builds.

I've excluded the i18n job from the main build. Nothing to do with the sling pipes build since it was not part of the contrib reactor.

I've also migrated the distribution job from the contrib build since it currently fails. I think it's a good idea to separate out unstable or slow jobs first, as that gets us the best result in terms of CI performance / signal to noise ration.

Right now all of the bundles and utility modules built by the 'default' reactor have been migrated to individual jobs. I still have a small number of errors to clear up; some of these are related to configuration/build order, but some of those might be a little tougher ( e.g. the health check ITs try to find SNAPSHOT bundles with pax-exam, but that setup is unaware of the repository.apache.org snapshots repository ).

The main sling-trunk-1.8 job now only builds the 'launchpad' modules. After stabilising the modules I will:

- deactivate the sling-trunk-1.8 job
- create individual jobs for the launchpad modules
- establish dependencies from the bundle to the launchpad builder module
- establish dependencies between bundle jobs themselves ( e.g. validation impl dependends on validation api )

Then the 'main' cycle is complete and contrib and samples will follow.

The above items are complete, but a couple of jobs are still unstable, including the launchpad.

See the following view for all the builds needing attention

https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/Sling-Dashboard/

Will let this bake for a while and also try to reduce/remove the failing/unstable builds.

this is cool, thanks a lot for the work robert.

do we plan to produce per-module jobs for the contrib area as well? would make sense. but we should wait for the "attic cleanup" there.

Definitely, I intend to do the same for contrib and samples.

I am waiting to make sure the current setup is 100% correct before moving to samples and contrib. I think I still have some launchpad dependencies I need to manually define ( e.g. launchpad/test-services -> launchpad/testing ) and also the testing and testing-war jobs are not stable yet.

For now I don't plan on splitting the tooling/maven part as it's relatively quick ( 7 minutes ). But of course we can do that if we decide to.

At the moment all the generated build jobs are stable, with two exceptions:

- sling-contrib-extensions-distribution-it-1.8, tracked under SLING-6088 )
- sling-bundles-jcr-it-jackrabbit-oak-1.7, which is on the way out according to [dev@sling - removal of it-jackrabbit-oak|http://markmail.org/message/h3brflvbugfdg5zu]

None of these require immediate action for me, so I will wait to see if anyone complains about jobs being incorrectly set up. Also we have some pending discussion regarding moving things from contrib and samples to the attic.

I will give this a couple of days to bake, and maybe create some jobs for modules in contrib and samples which I think are in no danger of being "attic'ed"

All module jobs are now modularised. Any follow-up fixes will be handled separately.
