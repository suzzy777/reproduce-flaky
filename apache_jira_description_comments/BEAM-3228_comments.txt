   Kinesis tests are hanging on KinesisMockReadTest and then it fails because of crashing forked VM. 
   Since it affects master build and the root cause is not clear for now, then the fast fix to prevent this issue will be to fork every running test. Later, the root cause should be investigated and, probably, fixed if needed. 
   The total time of running the all Kinesis tests was not drastically increased, only a little bit due to small number of Kinesis test suits.

I haven't seen this one in a bit.

This was silenced because we are forcing the Kinesis tests to run sequentially as a workaround, but a proper fix is still pending.

Oups just discovered that there is a more recent issue tracking the exact error case so resolving this one.

I overlooked this one confusing it with BEAM-3317. This is still alive and reproducible by removing the workaround on the pom file.
