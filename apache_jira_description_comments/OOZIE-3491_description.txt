If the System ID is longer than 10 characters Oozie trims it and prints out an error message:
{noformat}
System ID [oozie-oozi] exceeds maximum length [10], trimming
{noformat}
Which is confusing, because "oozie-oozi" does not exceeds 10 characters. This is not the original long system ID but the trimmed short one.

I think we should fix the error message and print out both the original and the new value.
