Hi [~amashenkov],  do you know Igniter who can review this change? Could you mention he or she in the ticket?

[~dpavlov],

Hi, I've asked  [~ivan.glukos] to review this one. 

[~amashenkov], code changes look good. However, there are some suspicious test fails:
IgniteClientNodesTestSuite: IgniteClientReconnectFailoverTest.testReconnectStreamerApi (fail rate 0,0%)
org.jsr107.tck.expiry.CacheExpiryTest.expire_whenAccessed (fail rate 0,0%) 
org.jsr107.tck.expiry.CacheExpiryTest.testCacheStatisticsRemoveAll (fail rate 0,0%)
While first one is probably flaky, last two failures look like real issues.

I believe this failure caused by throttling for in-memory mode. I've disable it and re-run test [1].

We have flacky test IgnitePdsWithTtlTest.testTtlIsAppliedAfterRestart [2]. 
 I'm in the middle of investigation and seems, we have a bug in GridCacheMapEntry.innerGet0() method that ignores entry expiration is some cases. Most probably, this bug is causes TCK test failures.
