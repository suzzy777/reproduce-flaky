I can imagine 2 different approach:
- Blacklist - Keeping every line, but removing the blacklisted ones
- Whitelist - Keeping only specific lines

I prefer the blacklist solution, because the other approach could hide unintended changes easily.

I think we might find a better logging level to use for the qtests. Currently we using the following settings:
- verbose - print debug messages, stack traces in case of an exception
- shownestederrs - print the nested exception - not dependent on verbose :)
- showwarnings - needs verbose on - prints out any warnings that exist for the current connection.

We might produce the same results as the TestCliDriver qtest if we use the silent mode. I have to check that.

Tested:
- silent mode removes every message (PREHOOK, POSTHOOK) as well.
- We might get away with running with {{verbose=false}}, since it is used mostly to log messages which are already removed from the result, but there are only a limited number of these



Here is my thoughts after some digging: Even though we might be able to create better filtering than the current one in QTestUtil, the main goal could be to generate the same output from the same query scripts. So if we decide to move a few tests from the CLI Driver to the BeeLine driver then we should be able to do it without changing the golden files.

The CLI output contains 3 types of data:
- Query results - columns separated by a single '\t' character
- PREHOOK logs
- POSTHOOK logs

I have yet to find anything else, but there might be something which I missed :)

Patch for providing the same golden files from BeeLine tests than from CLI tests

findbugs, checkstyle errors corrected

Opened the review request: https://reviews.apache.org/r/57693/

After discussion with [~kgyrtkirk], I think we should reconsider this approach.

Coming back soon with a revised patch.

New version. A little rough on the edges, but submit it anyway to check what Sir Jenkis has to say about it :)

There is an ongoing work on OperationLogs by [~aihuaxu], and it will drastically change the way the logs are handled. I think we should wait for it to finish

More fleshed out version. Let's see if it causes any unexpected errors.

Added extra configuration variables for using the truncated log files, and for not removing them after the query, and the session is closed.
This will help the other unit tests

[~kgyrtkirk], [~ychena], [~aihuaxu], [~vihangk1] you can review if you have time.

Thanks,
Peter

I like the new way this is currently handled, and the outputs are much tidier this way!

[~pvary]: I've taken some time to collect a few ideas about qtests...
https://gist.github.com/kgyrtkirk/89931b7e420c4950b7b36cc8fc1cb6a2
I know that some of it is not entirely doable right now...and I'm probably not entirely realistic in some points :)
...but anyway, I would be glad to hear what you think about it :)

Thanks for the review [~kgyrtkirk]!

And special thanks for the collection of the ideas into a document.
I agree most of the proposed ideas and there are some of them where I need some convincing, but I am open for all of them :)
Currently on PTO, but would be happy to discuss it further. Left some comments there anyway.

Peter

[~pvary] It seems like the patch needs some rebasing now...since HIVE-16345 is in
Thank you for your comments...It's good to know that you also see these things similarily! :)

Rebased the patch.
Since after the rebase the TestBeeLineDriver runs more query files, more replace patterns are needed:
- The output contains the original queries, so we should rewrite (default.src->src) for the output file as well
- More static regex for hiding the file locations, and serdes to match the CliDriver output
- More specific regex for hiding the database change in the explain results

Followup jira (HIVE-16449) is created to handle -- SORT_BEFORE_DIFF. Otherwise the query output files are the same as the CliDriver version output

Not related failures:
- HIVE-15535 - Flaky test : TestHS2HttpServer.testContextRootUrlRewrite
- HIVE-15776 - Flaky test: TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver vector_if_expr
- HIVE-15289 - Flaky test: TestSparkCliDriver.org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestSparkCliDriver (setup)

Maybe related:
- TestBeeLineDriver.testCliDriver[smb_mapjoin_11]

Will check the last one, but I do not think it is related to this test. For the first glance it seems to me a more general race condition instead.

Checked the TestBeeLineDriver.testCliDriver[smb_mapjoin_11] error.
It is caused by this:
- HIVE-16451- Race condition between HiveStatement.getQueryLog and HiveStatement.runAsyncOnServer

So the errors are unrelated

pushed to master. Thank you [~pvary] for taking care of this; the beeline outputs are starting to look much more natural.

I'm not sure how can we avoid "bending" the production code because of test related features...I'm still trying to come up with some idea for this...do you have any tought? ...since you have seen a lot of it lately :)

This adds two configuration parameters that do not need to be documented because they are for internal use only.  Here they are, just for the record (and searchability):

* hive.in.test.short.logs
* hive.in.test.remove.logs

HIVE-17382 renames the configs (no doc needed, internal use only):

*  hive.in.test.short.logs  ->  hive.testing.short.logs
* hive.in.test.remove.logs  ->  hive.testing.remove.logs
