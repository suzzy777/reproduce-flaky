ZooKeeper flaky test dashboard is a set of tools used to track, analyze, and report flaky tests. It's designed with the goal to automate most of the labor intensive part of work related to tracking, monitoring, analyzing and aggregating unit tests results from various Apache ZooKeeper builds. It also increases the visibility of the tests along with (in long term) the over all quality of the ZooKeeper builds. This work is inspired by similar work done on HBase side, with some the tools borrowed from HBase and customized for ZooKeeper use cases.
