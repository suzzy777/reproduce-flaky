All the tests except for TestMiniSparkOnYarnCliDriver for index_bitmap3.q are failing even without this change in the latest code base in master branch. index_bitmap3.q with TestMiniSparkOnYarnCliDriver is working fine locally so its failure doesn't seem to be related to this change.

Patch looks good, and tests are not related. The one that fails is a flaky issue detected in older tests.
+1

Thanks [~vihangk1] I committed this to 2.2
