What I was able to find in the logs:

# There is a lot of noise about one node not being let by other nodes to the topology as it has already left (this seems to be irrelevant to the test failure)
# There is an NPE (that probably caused the test failure), but additional information is needed to find the culprit. I'm adding it in the attached PR
# There is a secondary NPE (it is suppressed), I'm fixing it in the PR

[~ktkalenko@gridgain.com] could you please take a look at the attached PR?
