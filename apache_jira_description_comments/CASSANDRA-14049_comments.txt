I think there're a couple of issues here. First of all, there seems to be an oversight issue in ccm that may turn the test flaky, see ([CCM#641|https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm/pull/641]) (/cc [~philipthompson]). 

With this fixed, I'm regularly getting "UnknownColumnFamilyException reading from socket" errors from node3. I think the reason for this is that upon 2.1 -> 3.0 upgrade, node1+2 will convert the permissions from the legacy to the new roles tables, which don't exists on the remaining 2.1 node.

This already has been addressed a long time ago in CASSANDRA-9761. But for some reason, only the {{CassandraRoleManager}} will check if all nodes in the cluster have already been updated. The {{CassandraAuthorizer}} does not.

This no longer occurs.
