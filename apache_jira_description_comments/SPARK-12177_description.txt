Kafka 0.9 already released and it introduce new consumer API that not compatible with old one. So, I added new consumer api. I made separate classes in package org.apache.spark.streaming.kafka.v09 with changed API. I didn't remove old classes for more backward compatibility. User will not need to change his old spark applications when he uprgade to new Spark version.
Please rewiew my changes
