[~dpavlov] I fix this bug. Who can review my changes?
TC run in progress.

[~NIzhikov], could you notify when TC is completed and share link to run-all?

[~dpavlov] Thank you. Here is link to latest builds for this PR. I rerun some test suites because of timeouts. 

http://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=Ignite20Tests&branch_Ignite20Tests=pull%2F2384%2Fhead

Taking into account restarted tests which are passing now, I think TC run is OK. 
Most of failed tests are flaky in master now or failed somewhere else.
I think we may proceed with review.

[~ntikhonov@apache.org], could you please review changes from 
https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/2384
?
