[~rhatch], do we see this on any of our 2.1 -> 2.2 upgrade tests?

I think I may have tracked down the issue, it seems that this happens because sstables from the old version and new version both exist in the transaction and during upgrade cancel() is used to filter out the latest versions sstables, but cancel() is not fully removing the SSTableReader from the transaction so checkUnused() fails.

Patch attached.

[~JoshuaMcKenzie] to review

FYI Tested this patch on my node experiencing the upgrade issue and it was able to successfully upgrade the SSTables.

Changes LGTM.

Waiting on CI to pick up a branch I made of it; I'll run those tests and commit if it comes out clean.

[CI - testall|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/josh-mckenzie/job/josh-mckenzie-10008-testall/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/]
[CI - dtest|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/josh-mckenzie/job/josh-mckenzie-10008-dtest/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/]

The 2 extra dtests that failed are flaky; I tested this branch locally on a linux box and those 2 tests pass without issue.

Committed as {{1960e5b367d35020e95d84cae3fe6bad7fff14f1}} to 2.2 and merged up.

Thanks!
