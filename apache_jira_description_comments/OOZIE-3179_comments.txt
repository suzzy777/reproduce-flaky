Thanks for the rebase [~jphelps]. Yes, it's very important that we handle the OOZIE-3370 changes here. Can you upload the patch to the [ReviewBoard|https://reviews.apache.org/dashboard/]? It's much easier to review the code there.

Review board diff had a few extra changes I made (been a while since then) from Peter's review, which I just added back into patch #4. Will upload the same diff to Reviewboard [~asalamon74]
