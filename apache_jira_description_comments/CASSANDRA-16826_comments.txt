I made a few suggestions in the PR around the _retry_ method as it is a bit confusing now.  

-Also, please, acknowledge the other usages of _query_c1c2_ method, out of  _consistent_bootstrap_test_.- 

EDIT: [~dcapwell] pointed I was wrong, apparently he did already add the needed change but I missed it. My bad, I am sorry for overseeing It. The other suggestion stands :)

Thank you :)

Looks good to me.

Please also Green CI and loop it before commit to ensure there are no surprises, just in case. Thank you!

Here are some repeated runs of {{test_consistent_reads_after_move}} in the CircleCI test multiplexer, with MIDRES:
 * [j8-j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/748/workflows/0e17dc1d-7f16-4a11-90b0-0192b287bc9b/jobs/7533]
 * [j8-j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/748/workflows/0e17dc1d-7f16-4a11-90b0-0192b287bc9b/jobs/7534]
 * [j11-j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/748/workflows/2646028e-846c-4af9-bd16-b814f928d23a/jobs/7532]

It seems there are multiple failures.

Thanks [~adelapena], I think David looped it only locally. Reopening the ticket for further investigation. 

It seems the multiplexer failures are different, no client timeouts anymore. But still we need to fix those and not leave it flaky. 

I think that there are also some client request timeouts, eight in j8-j8

You are right! It seems there are 4 of them I missed around the others. 

removed myself.  If you look at the test failures in circle there are several things going on; each may need to be looked at

I did both a [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/499/workflows/a6c3e10c-39b8-468e-ba73-848be656e1bf/jobs/5840] and [j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/499/workflows/17b82ac4-136a-453e-bd8f-f5820bcea261/jobs/5842] repeated 500 runs each without failure, and the previous links are expired so I'm not sure what was wrong and I don't see any failures in butler.  I think we can close.

Indeed it doesn't seem to fail anymore. I have also run it again for both 4.1 ([j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1592/workflows/2febdefc-957b-42a6-b545-73ff7cbf17f9] and [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1592/workflows/0fb59648-ec0f-4b5d-af59-3ec9f36e6b22]) and trunk ([j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1591/workflows/c6c21209-fcd1-4626-94d6-5a6bb38c5d0c] and [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1591/workflows/40498ca4-7d06-4192-9dc5-b5b596e898d0]), and it survives another 500 runs. Also, it doesn't appear on Butler, so probably we should close.

Closing and returning to David since his patch solved this.
