All info can be found in attached log:

briefly: Cluster of 2 nodes with persistence, sequentially start nodes, activate, stop nodes using org.apache.ignite.Ignite#close, start nodes, activate:

expected :

1 node : Cluster ID and tag has been read from metastorage: null
2 node : Cluster ID and tag has been read from metastorage: null

stop

start

1 node: Cluster ID and tag has been read from metastorage: ClusterIdAndTag [id=some_id, tag=some_tag]

2 node: Cluster ID and tag has been read from metastorage: ClusterIdAndTag [id=some_id, tag=some_tag]

but obtained (check attach)

 

1 node : Cluster ID and tag has been read from metastorage: null
2 node : Cluster ID and tag has been read from metastorage: null

stop

start

1 node: Cluster ID and tag has been read from metastorage: null

2 node: Cluster ID and tag has been read from metastorage: ClusterIdAndTag [id=some_id, tag=some_tag]

and as a result : 
_Joining node has conflicting distributed metastorage data_
