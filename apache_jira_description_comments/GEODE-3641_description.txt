This test has been marked flaky since April of 2016, when the flaky test category was introduced to Geode.

The test class itself could stand for significant refactoring, including but not limited to:

* Removal of the 1,500+ lines of commented-out code.
* Application of Locator and/or Sever Startup Rules in place of extending a base test class.
* Mock classes and implement semaphore-style synchronization to impose deterministic behavior in tests that currently have potential race conditions.
