[~gezapeti] can you provide a sqoop import command to reproduce the issue? Are you saying the following should handle double quotes?

{code}
import  --connect jdbc:hsqldb:file:db.hsqldb --table TT --target-dir hdfs://localhost:8020/user/tucu/foo -m 1
{code}

with a fix this should work too

{code}
import  --connect "jdbc:hsqldb:file:db.hsqldb" --table "TT" --target-dir "hdfs://localhost:8020/user/tucu/foo" -m "1"
{code}

do I understand the problem correctly?

We got most of the user complaints when they are using the --query tag and then proceeded to copy-paste the command line into oozie.
Something like 
{code}
sqoop import --connect jdbc:mysql://example.com:3306/test --username new_user --password pwdpwd --m 1 --query 'SELECT * FROM employee' --target-dir /user/new_user/employee4 --verbose 
{code}

[~gezapeti] please review, I am handling the double quotes but it fails on single. I do have a test for single quote but commented it out for jenkins. Your ideas welcome.

for reference, if I uncomment the singlequotes test I get the following

<noformat>
Failed tests:   testSqoopActionWithArgsAndFreeFormQueryInSingleQuotes(org.apache.oozie.action.hadoop.TestSqoopActionExecutor): expected:<[SUCCEED]ED> but was:<[FAILED/KILL]ED>

We should use the same logic for splitting up pieces of string and keeping together quoted parts as in Spark so we avoid code duplication. You can move/rename SparkOptionsSplitter to a place where it's accessible by SqoopActionExecutor as well.

I think a more general solution, like the one in OOZIE-2984 should be the way.

I would like to have this fixed @dbist13. Do you have the time to work on this or can I take this over to continue on your patch?

[~gezapeti] please go ahead, I'm pretty busy in my day job now to work on this. Thank you

Thanks [~gezapeti] for kicking off a new build. PreCommit was working now.

I've checked the current version of the patch in more detail.
 
The plan was to handle commands like {{\-\-query 'SELECT * FROM employee'}} and use two tokens in this case ({{"\-\-query"}} and {{"SELECT * FROM employee"}}). The current patch works in this case.
 
It fails if single and double quotes are mixed like ' ... " .... " .... ' because it thinks that the first double quote closes the single quote. It would be easy to fix the patch and recognise the whole command like one token. 
 
I'm not sure if this is a good enough solution.
 
It will still fail if we want to use a single quote inside the query (e.g. search for O'Briens).

I've also talked to sqoop experts. The confirmed that sqoop command parsing is a rather complex task. If we want to be able to block-copy from shell to oozie, the best approach is probably mimicking the shell parsing. We would still need real-life examples to create lots of test cases.

The best solution would be some third party lib that handles this for us and is well-tested, developed. I could not find anything except for Java code snippets. (There are some 10+ year old things out there though)

It looks like we'll have to implement our own solution here unfortunately. 
I think something similar to [this gist|https://gist.github.com/raymyers/8077031] should be a good enough to start with. It handles embedding " and ' and escaping with "\"

Thanks [~gezapeti] for the list to the gist, I've created a bash-like splitter using that code. I moved this code to a nested class and created a separate unit test class for this. I've also added a new unit test method to {{TestSqoopActionExecutor}} because the existing methods were not really testing this feature.

Thanks for the patch [~asalamon74]!
I have a few review comments:
# please use org.junit instead of junit.framework when importing assertEquals
# don't forget to update the [Sqoop action documentation|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/docs/src/site/markdown/DG_SqoopActionExtension.md] with the new behavior

I'm a bit worried about changing default behavior, but I can't think of a scenario when this would break things. Can you?

Thanks [~gezapeti] for checking the patch. I'll address your comments in my next patch.

Yes, it changes the default behaviour which is not too good. I think it might cause problems if someone really wanted to use the {{command}} options. For instance this is a sample from Sqoop documentation (escaped by backspace enclosed by double quote):
{noformat}
sqoop import --fields-terminated-by , --escaped-by \\ --enclosed-by '\"' ...
{noformat}
In the old verson if you really wanted to use a single command you could specify as the following:
{noformat}
sqoop import --fields-terminated-by , --escaped-by \ --enclosed-by "
{noformat}
This will no longer work in the new version.

In case of changing default behaviour: can we just put a switch into oozie-default.xml where we can declare which mode we want to use? I think current users will be afraid of an upgrade due to many possible changes in their workflow. However, new users shall be forced to use the new way. Does it sound crazy?

Code review:
 * Does ShellSplitter need to be a static inner class? Isn't a normal class in a separate file means cleaner code?
 * Can you please extract characters into ShellSplitter constants which are used in the state machine?
 * In TestSqoopActionExecutor.java:242 you commented out Java code. Was that intentional and can be deleted?

 

Thanks for the code review [~dionusos]
 * This class tries to mimic bash, so there is nothing sqoop specific it. It would be good to put into a separate class.
 * Sure thing, I'll create constants.
 * Dead code was just a mistake, [~kmarton] already pointed this out, I'll remove it.

[~dionusos] Using a feature flag could help us to avoid problems with the existing customers. On the other hand, we already have lots of flags, that can be confusing. 

What should be the default value of this flag? If we'd like to encourage the users, the default value should be the 'new-style'. Of course it may change the current workflow for existing users, they will be asked to change this flag to 'old-style' if necessary.

[~markuskemper@me.com] Could you please share your experience. What are the common workflow for a typical oozie + sqoop user? Do they use the {{command}} tag or multiple {{arg}} tags?

I've uploaded a new test, I've tried to address all the suggestions. Most important changes:
 * To be able to test invalid inputs ( as suggested by [~kmarton] ) I've added exception handling.
 * I've introduced a feature flag ( as suggested by [~dionusos] ) to switch between the old space-based and the new shell-like splitting. The default value is the old-style.

Please check the new patch at review board.
