Currently, enabling or disabling cache metrics collection is available only via IgniteVisorCmd or JMX. Because it seems that IgniteVisorCmd is no longer being developed, it would be helpful to add a command to manage cache metrics collection.

Suggested syntax for a command:
{code:java}
--cache metrics enable|disable|status --caches cache1[,...,cacheN]|--all-caches
  Manages user cache metrics collection: enables, disables it or shows status.

  Parameters:
    --caches cache1[,...,cacheN]  - specifies a comma-separated list of cache names to which operation should be applied.
    --all-caches                  - applies operation to all user caches.
