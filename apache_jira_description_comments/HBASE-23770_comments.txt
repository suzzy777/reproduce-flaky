What I pushed on branch-2. Lets see how it does.

Here is screen shot of current failure rate on the GCE builds.....

Test was recently added by:

HBASE-23078 BaseLoadBalancer should consider region replicas when randomAssignment and roundRobinAssignment (#663) Guanghao Zhang 9/29/19, 2:36 AM

... to 2.2+ but 2.2 does not have failures, only branch-2 (2.3.0) -- not even Master.

Leaving open to see how it does over next 24hours.

Pushing on master too. It seems to have cured this flakey. See picture below. The patch went in just after the last red.
