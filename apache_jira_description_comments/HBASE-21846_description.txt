Flaky test:
[ERROR]   TestFilterListOrOperatorWithBlkCnt.testMultiRowRangeWithFilterListOrOperatorWithBlkCnt:127 expected:<4> but was:<5>


Added some debugging logs and test result as below:
1028 2019-02-05 01:14:13,525 INFO  [main] filter.TestFilterListOrOperatorWithBlkCnt(118): 0. blocksStart: 0

Basically,in my testing environment the scan with filterList read 3 blocks. Latter 2 scans read 1 respectively.
