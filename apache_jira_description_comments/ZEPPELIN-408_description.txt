I'm using Zeppelin 0.6.0-SNAPSHOT. To specify directory where notebook is saved, I changed {{zeppelin.notebook.dir}} property in {{zeppelin-site.xml}}. But It didn't work.

From my investigation, the problem is caused by initializing notebook path in start scripts({{zeppelin.sh}}, {{zeppelin-daemon.sh}}). These scripts call {{common.sh}} which initializes notebook path as {{$ZEPPELIN_HOME/notebook}}. And because the path is set as environment variable, {{ZeppelinConfiguration}} didn't use value from XML configuration. 

Because there is initialization of interpreter directory path, I think we cannot set interpreter directory path using {{zeppelin-site.xml}} also. But I didn't test about that.
