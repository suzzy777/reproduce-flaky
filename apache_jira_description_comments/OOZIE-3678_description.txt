Before Oozie starts the Yarn application it assembles the class path which's elements' paths are resolved with
{code:java}
remoteFS.resolvePath(p){code}
which can cause slowness and high NameNode load.

The intention is to make this path resolution configurable (ability to turn it on/off) via an Oozie configuration thus customers can turn it off when they experience job start slowness. Default value should result the new behaviour is active.
