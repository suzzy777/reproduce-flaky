Following up on a discussion on the mailing list.

We want to keep the Flink version stable across different versions to avoid upgrade pain for long-term users. At the same time, there are users out there with newer Flink clusters and developers also want to utilize new Flink features.

It would be great to build multiple versions of the Flink Runner against different Flink versions.

When the upgrade is as simple as changing the version property in the build script, this should be pretty straight-forward. If not, having a "base version" and applying a patch during the build could be an option. We should avoid duplicating any Runner code.
