[Test|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/yifan-c/cassandra?branch=CASSANDRA-15954-compactionId-in-exception-trunk]

The patch simply add the taskID/compactionId to the {{toString}} method of {{CompactionInfo}}. So the taskId is displayed in the log. 

LGTM +1.  Will wait for [~maedhroz] review

Dropped a couple minor comments, but LGTM otherwise.

latest logic LGTM, can we run through dtests?

spoke in slack, this broke a dtest so will need dtest to be updated.

+1 after the latest changes

Waiting on solution for dtest issues before final review

Thanks for the reviews!
