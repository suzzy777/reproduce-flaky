I've got a stuck thread on HTable.get() that can't be interrupted, looks like its designed to be interruptible but can't be in interrupted in practice due to while loop.

The offending code is in org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ipc.HBaseClient.call() line 981, it catches InterruptedException then goes right back to waiting due to the while loop.

It looks like future versions of the client (.95+) are significantly different and might not have this problem... Not sure about release schedules etc. or if this version is still getting patched.
