Hi, [~agoncharuk], 

I have run experimental branch ignite-6428-max-size with enabled 150 MBytes default memory policy size (instead of 100). Test now not hanging, but still have flaky failures: please see 30 run results in https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Ignite20Tests_IgnitePdsIndexing&branch_Ignite20Tests=pull%2F2690%2Fhead&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv

I suggest to merge change from PR https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/2690 and fix flaky failures coming next to this change.

Merged to master
