IMPALA-8795: Turn on events processing by default

This commit turns on events processing by default. The default
polling interval is set as 1 second which can be overrriden by
setting hms_event_polling_interval_s to non-default value.

When the event polling turned on by default this patch also
moves the test_event_processing.py to tests/metadata instead
of custom cluster test. Some tests within test_event_processing.py
which needed non-default configurations were moved to
tests/custom_cluster/test_events_custom_configs.py.

Additionally, some other tests were modified to take into account
the automatic ability of Impala to detect newly added tables
from hive.

Testing done:
1. Ran exhaustive tests by turning on the events processing multiple
times.
2. Ran exhaustive tests by disabling events processing.
3. Ran dockerized tests.

IMPALA-8795: (Addendum) Fix test_hms_integration flakiness

The previous commit for IMPALA-8795 modifies the
test_sanity test to account for event processing is enabled.
However, it missed removing a assert statement before
event processing check. This commit modifies the test
to remove the unnecessary assert which fails intermittently.

Testing:
Looped the test 25 times and make sure it works with
default configs.

IMPALA-10885: Deflake test_get_table_req_without_fallback

The test originally was written when events processing
was not turned on by default. However, after
IMPALA-8795 the events processing is turned on by
default and this test fails intermittently.

The error was reproduced by adding a simple
sleep statement in the test just before issuing a
get_table API call which was expected to fail.

Testing:
1. Looped the test for 25 times with the change and with
the sleep statement which reproduced the failure.

IMPALA-11091: Update documentation of event polling

IMPALA-8795 turns on event polling by default but the
documentation still says that it is a preview feature.
This change updates the documentation to say that the
feature is GA and enabled by default since Impala 4.1
