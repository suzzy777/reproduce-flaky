IgniteCacheTopologyValidatorTest#testSplitWithBaseline is flaky we need to fix it.

https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteExtensions_Tests&testNameId=-4574202048063239300&tab=testDetails

The main problem here is that rebalance of test keys could take more then 30 seconds to complete. 30 seconds is a timeout that is used by awaitPartitionMapExchange method in which assertion is arised.

The proposed solution - to decrease  the number of test keys.
