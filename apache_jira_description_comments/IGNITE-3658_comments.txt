Currently we have lots of failing and flaky tests. Some of them can be fixed immediately. Some of them are scheduled for further fixes. Others are not planned at all. 

We need to create a special suite where all such tests will be tracked. Proposed implementation plan:
1) Implement special test suite where we can optionally execute only ignored tests or all tests except of ignored. We can use JUnit 4 {{Ignore}} annotation for this.
2) Refactor all tests suites so that all tests go through the same path.
3) Add suite to TC.
4) Gradually log all failing tests and create tickets for them.

Looks like this is not the best way to work with failing tests. Hopefully we will find better way.
