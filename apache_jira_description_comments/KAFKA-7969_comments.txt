Failed again (same error): [https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/apache-kafka-test/job/2.2/33/]

I still haven't been able to reproduce this well. I ran it for 200-300 times, then ran it in combination with some other tests from the suite for a total of 1h 8m. I will dive a bit more into the code to try and figure out what is causing this

No luck still... I managed to find out that we get this error when the broker returns an empty map for the `OffsetFetchRequest`.
This is the code that gets executed when we fetch all the offsets - [https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/a8f2307164ce0f1f47c458eee8f54173f7218a16/core/src/main/scala/kafka/coordinator/group/GroupMetadataManager.scala#L461.] I then started digging around when we might remove these `offsets` but it seems to be only from expiry (which definitely doesn't happen in this test) and `deleteGroup/deletePartition` calls.

Removed Fix Version 2.2.1 as this issue is not blocking that release.

Since this is not a blocker issue, as part of the 2.6.0 release process I'm changing the fix version to `2.6.1` and `2.7.0`. If this is incorrect, please respond and discuss on the "[DISCUSS] Apache Kafka 2.6.0 release" discussion mailing list thread.

Since this is not a blocker, there is no active PR  I'm clearing the "fix version" field as part of the 2.7.0 release process.
