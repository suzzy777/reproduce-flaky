Simple fix.  I verified this by hacking {{XConfiguration#testSubstituteVarUnlimited()}} to run before {{XConfiguration#initSubstituteDepth()}} and it passed now.

Can we move XConfiguration.initalized = false; to a setup() method for the testcase class so that new tests don't have to worry about it.

Good point.  002 patch does that.

Test failures unrelated.  The path only modifies {{TestXConfiguration.testSubstituteVar}}.

Thanks for the review Rohini.  Committed to trunk!

[~rohini], putting {{XConfiguration.initalized = false;}} in {{setUp()}} doesn't always work because we then call {{super.setUp()}}, which does a whole bunch of things.  The tests themselves also do some things with {{Services}}.  If any of those calls {{new XConfiguration()}}, it will initialize, and break the test.  (in fact, it can now break both tests)

I think the safest fix here is to add {{XConfiguration.initalized = false;}} right before the calls to {{new XConfiguration()}} to ensure that nothing else can interfere.

The amendment patch moves the {{XConfiguration.initalized = false;}} calls to the right places.

+1. That should be fine. Thanks for taking the time to dig into all these flaky tests and fixing them.

No problem.  Thanks for helping review all of these so quickly.

Closing issue; Oozie 4.3.0 is released.
