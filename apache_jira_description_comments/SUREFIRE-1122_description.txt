Hi,
I just tried the new feature -Dfailsafe.rerunFailingTestsCount on our failsafe build.
Unfortunately, when running the build using parallel=all, it seems the junit xml files are not generated correctly.
I've tried running it multiple different ways, including classedAndMethods, and all, but it seems to generate an incorrect xml file either way.
I've attached both files here.

I can provide a pom and java test case if required.
