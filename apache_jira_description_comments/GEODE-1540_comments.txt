I couldn't find any obvious problems with this test code that would allow it to be labelled as flaky.
It does do 100 puts and then expect to see the stat change to have 100 items queued for write and that is what fails.
The first time the test did 100 puts this assertion worked. It was the second time after it flushed the first 100 that it never got to 100.

I couldn't find any timing issues or race conditions. A problem with the test is that when an assertion failed it does not tell you what the actual value of the stat was. I'm going to check in a change so that if it fails again the test will list out what the actual stat value was.

GEODE-1540: fix testAsyncStats

Test now uses awaitility and if a stat never does get to the expected
value will now fail with an assertion that shows the actual and expected
value of the stat.


reopen if it reproduces; with the new assertions if it fails again more info will be provided
