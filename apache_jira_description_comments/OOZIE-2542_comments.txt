Looks like a good idea.
The logging part always logs the value "non-finalizing" instead of the actual value of _brokerImplConfig_, otherwise the patch looks good.

Thanks. I was testing this in on my localhost and generated patch a bit early. OOZIE-2542-V2.patch fixed that.

bq. the patch contains 2 line(s) longer than 132 characters
  Please fix this

Please set the default value to "non-finalizing" in oozie-default.xml and change documentation saying setting empty space will unset the value. I don't see any reason to have empty space as default and asking users to set it for this one if this is a safe change. If there are issues after the change with leaked connections which have been missed, then we can decide to either fix leaked connections and if that is not possible disable this by default in a separate jira.



This is an advance setting. Most of the user will not hit GC pause hitting because of JPA. I never heard anybody complaining about this.
So the safest option to go with the default option and if anybody is facing the GC pause issue, they can override.
The purpose is to provide a setting to disable to finalization if needed.

If this is something of benefit for code execution and is safe to do and will help with performance in general, we should make it default. Unless this is something risky and can have issues, I don't see any reason to have one other extra setting that users have to specifically tune.

Discuss this internally with Rohini and we discussed to keep default as non-finalizing

+1. Please check if these tests are just flaky and pass locally before checking in. I haven't seen these tests fail before or jiras for them as flaky tests.

They are flaky and I have seen them failing earlier also.

Thanks Rohini and Peter for review. Committed to trunk.

Closing issue; Oozie 4.3.0 is released.
