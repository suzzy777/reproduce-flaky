Thanks for the contribution [~roeyshemtov24]!

Can you please extract the code to a method e.g. {{resolveExecutable()}}, and surround {{if-else}} with brackets? Thanks! And, please, also update the documentation {{DG_ShellActionExtension.twiki}}.

Thanks [~roeyshemtov24]. It duplicates [OOZIE-3086|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE-3086].

Upload new patch.

According to [~andras.piros], i extract the code to outside method, and surround {{if-else}} with brackets,

but the DG_ShellActionExtension.twiki looks fine to me, because according to the twiki:
{code:java}
The =exec= element must contain the path of the Shell command to
execute.
{code}
it say you must put the path to the shell comand (or out bash file in this case),

so what should i change in that?

[~andras.piros] any suggestion?

[~roeyshemtov24] thanks for the updated patch!

Some propositions:
* test {{ShellActionExecutor#resolveExecutable()}} separately
* check in {{ShellActionExecutor#resolveExecutable()}} whether the {{exec}} is really present and is a file
* let's not modify the existing license header of {{ShellActionExecutor}} - pre-commit hook takes a predefined template to check against
* document the existing and new functionality in {{DG_ShellActionExtension.twiki}} describing both ways
