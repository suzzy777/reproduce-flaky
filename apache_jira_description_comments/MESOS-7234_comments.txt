[~gkleiman] and I looked into this and our hypothesis is that inside `containerizer::reap()` the lambda that reads the container status file is racing with init/nanny process that writes to it. [~klueska] and [~jieyu] is this a known issue? If yes, is there a fix planned? One solution might be for `Launcher::fork()` to return both the container pid and the (optional) init pid and making the containerizer do a reap on the init pid instead of the container pid when init pid is some.
