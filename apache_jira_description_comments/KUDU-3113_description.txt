I enabled the auto-rebalancer and saw the following warnings when letting it run on a cluster with a single empty tserver. I see the following in the logs.
{code:java}
W0430 18:08:48.829325 170113 auto_rebalancer.cc:246] failed to send replica move request: Network error: unable to resolve address for deb718184b474c3db8dfe2d61133dfa1: Name or service not known {code}
It seems like we're passing in a UUID when we should be passing a host:Â [https://github.com/apache/kudu/blob/master/src/kudu/master/auto_rebalancer.cc#L431]

Given the feature is marked experimental, I don't think this is a release blocker, but we should probably remove it from the release notes for now.
