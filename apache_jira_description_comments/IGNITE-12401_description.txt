It came to my attention while checking for Range Queries support that we don't actually check that found query results are the correct ones.

We were checking that we got some results, but not whether they were expected.

And voila, it turns out that Range Queries examples, as well as some other test cases, will readily fail when run with such checks! A query will return same value repeatedly, e.g. range query will return the "1" record twice, and limited text query will return "14" record twice.

It didn't really occur on non-range queries before the introduction of limits.

I think we should not ship broken limit queries. Maybe also fix range queries, if it's hard let's @Ignore them for now.
