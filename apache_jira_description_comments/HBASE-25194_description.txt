As said in the parent issue.

And I tried to use the publishHTML target on jenkins job configuration page, the help message for reportDir is

{noformat}
The path to the HTML report directory relative to the workspace.
{noformat}

For the reportFiles is

{noformat}
The file(s) to provide links inside the report directory
{noformat}

I think this clearly means that the plugin will publish all the files under reportDir, the reportFiles is just the index page.
