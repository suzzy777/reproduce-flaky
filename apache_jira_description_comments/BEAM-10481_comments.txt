Thanks for reporting. It's strange since we have a [dedicated test |https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Java_ValidatesRunner_Spark/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.apache.beam.runners.spark.translation.streaming/ResumeFromCheckpointStreamingTest/] for SparkRunner on this but it doesn't fail.

I guess this test could be not very correct since after the first run (it does two) it removes checkpoint directory and it still passes.

Any workaround for this issue?  We're experiencing this as well, even with setting {{--enableSparkMetricSinks=false}}.  We do need checkpoint directories for our streaming application.

The workaround appears to be removing the {{beam-checkpoint}} sub-directory before each launch of the application.  In the meantime, I've also submitted a pull request that should ensure registration of the accumulators occur.
