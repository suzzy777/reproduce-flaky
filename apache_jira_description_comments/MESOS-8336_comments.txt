Disabled the test for now.

The root cause here is a very familiar one, that has already rendered countless other tests flaky. In particular, I'm talking about this line in `slave.cpp`:
{noformat}
    // Wait for a random amount of time before authentication or
    // registration.
    Duration duration =
      flags.registration_backoff_factor * ((double) os::random() / RAND_MAX);{noformat}
Here, the agent is sending the re-tried `RegisterSlaveMessage` after 9ms, *just* before shutting down, and the master notices that the network link is down before it gets to processing the message.

This leads to the master assigning a second slave ID, almost immediately removing the slave again because the network link is broken as well, and finally the test seeing the remnants of this second slave in the registry.

    Fixed flakyness in MasterTests.RegistryUpdateAfterReconfiguration.
    
    It could happen that an agent resends its `RegisterSlaveMessage`
    and with the correct timing, the master would assume that it
    comes from a new agent with the same pid and store its information
    in the registry. See MESOS-8336.
