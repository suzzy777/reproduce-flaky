It looks like minimal change is to modify method org.apache.ignite.internal.processors.igfs.IgfsDataManager#processBatch (IgfsDataManager, lines 1013 - 1050) replacing the IgfsBlocksMessage sending with async cache.put() invocations with saving their futures, + changing the org.apache.ignite.internal.processors.igfs.IgfsDataManager#processAckMessage method marking those stored futures as completed.

Questions: 
1) logic of differentiating collocated/non-collocated keys in method org.apache.ignite.internal.processors.igfs.IgfsDataManager#processPartialBlockWrite is not quite clear to me. (But may be we can leave it as is.)
2) We should state a solid contract of writing to secondary file system (dual modes). Currently writing to the 2ndary fs is implemented via org.apache.ignite.internal.processors.igfs.IgfsFileWorkerBatch class: this is a runnable that asynchronously duplicates primary Fs writing to the 2ndary Fs (asynchronously because the data slices are put into a queue and taken from there by the worker runnable on another thread). The implementation is waiting for this 2ndary write completion *only* in case of DUAL_SYNC mode. But in DUAL_ASYNC mode we may complete primary write, while write to the 2ndary Fs is not completed. This way, on an error on 2ndary Fs the file may be not completely written on the 2ndary Fs.  Is this correct behavior, and may we give more guarantees in this case?

Answering q.2 - yes, this was made intentionally. The goal of ASYNC mode is to "speedup" writes for user thread. We cannot give more guarantees here.

Ivan, please address the following issues:
1) GridCacheMapEntry: no need to wait for free space available, just throw exception immediately.
2) IgfsDataManager: remove unused code.

done.

Cancelling the patch and moving to 1.7. We performed heavy performance-related refactorings and the whole ticket requires serious revision.

Also sometimes we see hangs during file updates. Probably they are caused by a kind of thread-pool starvation. Probably this problem is related to the ticket. Once we switch to normal cache updates, the problem is likely to go away.

Same pull request: https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/170 .
Tests passed on TC.

Ivan, my comments:
1) IgfsDataManager.nextAffinityKey() - it can only return null on the first line. If you pass this condition, then it means that at least current node is affinity node, so "no data nodes" situation is not possible.
2) WriteCompletionFuture - concurrency algorithm contains races. For example, you may end up in negative "completedBlocksCnt", so some of your assertions will fail. I do not understand why do we need this future. All we need is to write initiate several cache puts and wait for result. 
3) Moreover, failed cache operation doesn't necessarily means that we should stop write. For example, if a node is stopped concurrently, you may receive and exception, but instead of failing write you should perform a re-try. 

implemented new version w/o WriteCompletionFuture.
Tests are passing on TC.

Ivan, I simplified solution even further:
1) Readers hierarchy is removed in favor of a single simple method {{IgfsUtils.readData()}}.
2) Removed size check from {{GridCacheMapEntry}}. It seems to me that "size" concept is invalid. Instead, user should rely solely on expiry policy. All other size-related code should be deprecated. I'll create another ticket for this.

Please apply my changes, review them and ensure that IGFS/Hadoop tests pass. Then return back to me for final merge.

Vladimir.

    1743: Vladimir"s finalization version.

----


https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/678 

tests are passing except some sporadical flaky hangups that occur in master branch also.

Latest benchmarks shown that it is very important to minimize amount of network calls. So we have to benchmark it extensively before making any decisions. 
I'll keep the ticket opened for a while.

Will not fix it for now as adding 2PC semantics might seriously slow us down.
