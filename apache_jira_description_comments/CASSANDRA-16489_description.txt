In CASSANDRA-14793 a new circle job config was added directly to the CircleCI base, LOWRES, MIDRES and HIGHRES config files, but not to the template file. When the config was regenerated for CASSANDRA-16474, the new job was lost. We should restore it and add it to the config template to avoid any reoccurrence.
