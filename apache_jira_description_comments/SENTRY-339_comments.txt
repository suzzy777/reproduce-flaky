Uploading initial patch for review..

Missed the sql script modifications in the earlier patch..

Hi [~asuresh]
Itâ€™s great, I'm agreed with you.
I have some question about the patch:
1. I think we may need define a composite unique index key in jdo.
{code:xml|borderStyle=solid}
<class name="MSentryPrivilege" ...>
<field name="...">
    ...
</field>
<index name="PrivilegeIndex" unique="true">
    <field name="serverName"/>
    <field name="dbName"/>
    ......
</index>
</class>
{code}
2. for the thrift api {{sentry_policy_service.thrift}}, I'm not an expert about thrift, My question is 
if {{action}} need set "" by default, need the {{grantorPrincipal}} set one?

Please correct me if I misunderstood.

Regards
Dapeng

[~dapengsun],
Thank you for the feedback !!

bq. 1. I think we may need define a composite unique index key in jdo
So, I was actually more interested in imposing a unique constraint on a set of columns.. not so much an index. But yeah, I agree the index with unique flag set to true should enforce it.. will update the patch.

bq.  if action need set "" by default, need the grantorPrincipal set one..
When we were using {{privilegeName}} earlier, the grantorPrincipal was not a part of it. only server, db, table, uri and action. I wanted to make just the minimun changes to the thrift file to support this. Also, unique constraint for certains DBs require non-null column, which is why we need server, db, table, uri and action to be non-null. We have no such requirement for the grantorPrincipal column.

Hope this makes sense ?

Thank you for your accept. I think the set should cover all the columns which method {{private MSentryPrivilege getMSentryPrivilege(TSentryPrivilege tPriv, PersistenceManager pm)}} used.

Got it! Thank you.

Hi, Arun
I have seen dapeng's comment, and you will update your patch to set a composite index for privilegeName.
But in last patch, I haven't seen it.
Sentry-340 deponds on this patch, could you please update your patch?

Updating patch addressing [~sravya]'s and [~dapengsun]'s feedback. thanx guys..

uploaded latest patch

@Arun, looks like the pre commit build has some failures. Pre commit is a bit flaky in terms of resources(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SENTRY-344), but above once are functional failures. Can you please take a look? Thanks! Also I think we should hold on to push this change to release 1.4.0 until we test it out on all backend dbs. What do you think?

Arun, is the patch submitted today the latest one? I still see required string serverName = "" in the thrift definition? It is the same on RB as well. Thanks!

Latest Patch... removing 'required serverName = ""'

Hi Arun, I see 4 failures with your patch: 

org.apache.sentry.tests.e2e.dbprovider.TestDatabaseProvider.testCornerCases

Can you please double check and repost the patch on both jira and RB? Thanks!
