I'm +1 on the patch and dtest. I ran the dtest w/o the patch can confirmed the failure, then with and confirmed success.

The only minor nit I have is on the dtest where you changed the {{prepare}} function. Maybe I'm missing something, but couldn't

{code}
        if not random_partitioner:
            cluster.set_partitioner("org.apache.cassandra.dht.Murmur3Partitioner")
        else:
            if random_partitioner:
                cluster.set_partitioner("org.apache.cassandra.dht.RandomPartitioner")
            else:
                cluster.set_partitioner("org.apache.cassandra.dht.Murmur3Partitioner")
{code}

be simplified as 

{code}
        if random_partitioner:
            cluster.set_partitioner("org.apache.cassandra.dht.RandomPartitioner")
        else:
            cluster.set_partitioner("org.apache.cassandra.dht.Murmur3Partitioner")
{code}

wrt branches to commit on, for sure we need this on 3.0 and 3.11. We also need it on trunk, but should wait to see what happens with CASSANDRA-13291?

[~jasobrown] thanks for the review & sorry for the delay in getting back to this. 

You're totally right about the dtest, [so I've made it sane as you suggested|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra-dtest/commit/edc48bc965e842628413cfd50a7a21071d7b098a]. As the upstream branches have moved on in since you reviewed, I've rebased & force pushed to trigger CI to run again. The addition of CASSANDRA-13291 to trunk was no issue as both branches took the same approach. Unless you have any concerns, I'll commit once CI is done. Thanks.

lgtm, and thanks for confirming my python skills aren't complete garbage :D

The CI was generally good barring a couple of flaky-ish tests which I've checked are passing locally, so I've committed to 3.0 in {{58daf1376456289f97f0ef0b0daf9e0d03ba6b81}} and merged to 3.11 and trunk.
