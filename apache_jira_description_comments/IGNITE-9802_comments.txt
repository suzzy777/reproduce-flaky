    IGNITE-9802

    Fix for the test. 
    
    The problem was that PME happens and prevent to closing idle connections. The test needs close connections to recreate comm client. There was only 1s sleep. I replace it with **awaitPartitionMapExchange** and **waitForCondition**.  
    
    Also, code style and inspections fix.
