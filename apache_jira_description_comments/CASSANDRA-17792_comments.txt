Thank you for filing the ticket. I will take a look. 

I got the reproduction. 
The NPE is thrown due to a race condition. In {{CommitLogSegmentManagerCDC#createSegment}}, it creates a new segment and {{processNewSegment}}, where it kicks off {{recalculateOverflowSize}} (where the NPE is thrown) in a different thread. Finally, the method returns and the {{availableSegment}} is updated to the new segment. Then, it signals the thread that waits on the {{availableSegment}} and the thread will update {{allocatingFrom}} to the {{availableSegment}}, (see {{AbstractCommitLogSegmentManager#advanceAllocatingFrom}}). As mentioned earlier, {{recalculateOverflowSize}} is started in a different thread, and it assumes that {{allocatingFrom}} is already updated. However, in the rare conditions,  {{allocatingFrom}} still has the old value, which is {{null}}, hence the NPE.

+1'ed the PR; forgot to here. :)

Thank you for reviewing! I updated the JIRA title to reflect the fix.Â
