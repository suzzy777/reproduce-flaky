The current code uses a combination of seeding thread, persisting and loading offsets from sling repo and sending single seeding messages.

In sum this means we send at least one seeding message (seeding thread) on first run and one seeding message on following runs.

I propose to switch back to a pure seeding thread solution and make sure it terminates correctly. This solution should in almost all cases also just send 1 message and is a lot simpler.
