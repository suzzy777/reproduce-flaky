In our internal environment, there was a test failure while running SLS tests with Jenkins.
It's difficult to align the uncaught exceptions (in this case an NPE) and the log itself as the exception is logged with {{e.printStackTrace()}}.
This jira is to replace printStackTrace calls in SLS with {{LOG.error("msg", exception)}}.
