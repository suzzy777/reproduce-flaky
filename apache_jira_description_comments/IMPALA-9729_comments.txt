This is a quirk in GetExecSummary() where it did different things for archived and non-archived queries when you call "summary" on a DDL query (or generally any queries without backend execution). So the error returned in the shell is different in the two cases.

I'm testing a fix now.

IMPALA-9729: consistent GetExecSummary() behaviour

Before IMPALA-9380, GetExecSummary() for archived
queries without a coordinator returned a blank TExecSummary,
but for in-flight queries it returned a "not found" error.

This was masked by the synchronous query unregistration,
but now has made an impala-shell test flaky, because the
close() RPC returns to the shell before the query is archived,
so the following GetExecSummary() call may go down either
code path.

This change makes the behaviour consistent for both code
paths and preserves impala-shell behaviour.

Testing:
Looped TestImpalaShell.test_summary to make sure flakiness was
fixed.
