OOZIE-1335 made Oozie use uber mode for the launcher job by default.  We should also increase the AM container size in case the launcher job needs more memory (e.g. a Pig job).

yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.mb and yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts. yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.mb is easy and you can just set and overwrite. You will have to do some string manipulation with yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts or append hoping the last values will take effect. Not sure if there are jvm's (IBM or openjdk) which will take the first value.
