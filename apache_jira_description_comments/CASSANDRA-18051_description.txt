As pointed in CASSANDRA-18001, there are two Python Large DTests that fail because of not enough resources with large containers. [~adelapena] looked into them and suggested that the tests themselves can be optimized for running on Large containers instead of using XLarge containers for only two tests from the whole suite. 
{quote}As for the two tests starting nine nodes each, {{test_network_topology_strategy}} and {{{}test_network_topology_strategy_each_quorum{}}}, I think they were added by CASSANDRA-10584 to test multi-DC consistency levels. I wonder if they actually need to start 3 data centers with 3 nodes each. Would two data centers with 3 nodes be enough to test multi-DC consistency levels with multiple data centers? 6 nodes should be doable on Circle with the current resources.

EDIT: On further testing it was noticed that the tests also started failing on 3.0 and 3.11 even with XLarge containers and there might be also some timing issue further involved and to be investigated.
