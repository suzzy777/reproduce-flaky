In cases where workflow is already in terminal status (except failed) but the coord action is not yet updated and still running, following will happen if a kill command is issued on the coord job: 

Kill on Coordjob will make the kill on coordaction pending until the children are also killed. However, as the wf in terminal state (except failed), the wf will not be killed and preverifycondition will fail. The wf doesn't update its parent and hence the coordaction kill will still be pending. Two problems: Status transit service will not resolve the state of this coord job as some the actions are still pending Recovery service will try to recover this killed coord action and keep on reissuing the kill command.
