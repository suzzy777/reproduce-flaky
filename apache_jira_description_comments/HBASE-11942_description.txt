TestHRegionBusyWait.testRegionTooBusy() has a very small timeout (6s) causing flakiness (seen on windows) and also causes TestHRegion tests to run twice: 

{code}
public class TestHRegionBusyWait extends TestHRegion {
   // TODO: This subclass runs all the tests in TestHRegion as well as the test below which means
   // all TestHRegion tests are run twice.
{code}
