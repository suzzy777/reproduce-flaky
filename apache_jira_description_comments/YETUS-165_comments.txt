There are a few use cases I have in mind for this:
* If we're troubleshooting a flaky test failure that only repros in Jenkins, then we can issue runs in rapid succession to troubleshoot that specific test.
* If we're posting a prototype patch that isn't intended to be committed, then it might still be valuable to click Submit Patch to run a small subset of tests as a basic check.
* If we're working on a feature branch, then we might prefer quicker test cycles initially, followed by full test runs towards the end of development.

We could do something like allowing a patch to provide a /test-to-run text file listing the test suites to run, which test-patch.sh would feed into {{mvn test -Dtest=...}}.  Feature branches might choose to commit the file temporarily if it's helpful.

We might want the output from test-patch.sh to vote -1 automatically if this feature is used.  That would help committers avoid accidentally committing a patch that hadn't gone through the full test run.

Closing this as fixed, as this feature is part of YETUS-658.
