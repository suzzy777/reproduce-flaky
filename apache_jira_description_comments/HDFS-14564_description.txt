Splitting this out from HDFS-14478

The {{PositionedReadable#readFully}} APIs have existed for a while, but have never been exposed via libhdfs.

HDFS-3246 added a new interface called {{ByteBufferPositionedReadable}} that provides a {{ByteBuffer}} version of {{PositionedReadable}}, but it does not contain a {{readFully}} method.
