I am not sure about the `testClose` ones. It seems like it would be good to test that with SSL as well. We should have a few `send` tests that are tested with multiple protocols.

How about reducing the above list to:

# testSendCompressedMessageWithLogAppendTime
# testSendNonCompressedMessageWithLogApendTime
# testAutoCreateTopic
# testFlush
# testSendWithInvalidCreateTime


I'd probably remove `testFlush`. The rest sounds good.

+1, testFlush has been one of the most flaky tests as well.
