This JIRA tracks the improvement of the Beam release process as [discussed in the dev list|https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d52ffbfca21eee953a230100520bd56d947a359c0029d5c291b736a7@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E]. In summary, this change will hopefully increase the greenness of the build by: increasing coverage, adding pre and post commits to release validation, and adding a regular cadence to look at flaky and backlogged tests.
