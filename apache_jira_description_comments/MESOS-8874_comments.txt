    Fixed a race in resource provider resubscription test.

    We previously did not make ensure that after the simulated agent
    failover in
    `ResourceProviderManagerHttpApiTest.ResubscribeResourceProvider` the
    mock resource provider created as part of the test did not reconnect
    to the restarted agent (as opposed to the newly initialized resource
    provider). This lead to unmet test expectations.

    With this patch we now explicitly tear down the mock resource provider
    after we have detected that the agent went away to prevent the race.
