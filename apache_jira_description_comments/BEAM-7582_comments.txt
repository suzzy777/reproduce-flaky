This issue was marked "stale-P2" and has not received a public comment in 14 days. It is now automatically moved to P3. If you are still affected by it, you can comment and move it back to P2.

I just re-enabled the test in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12750.

I'll monitor over the next week to see if it increases flakiness, if it does I'll @ignore it again and use this jira to track the fix. If it doesn't I'll resolve this jira.

I think this particular issue may have been resolved by bumping the pubsub client default timeout in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11985

No flakes since re-enabling (https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_SQL/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/junit/org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.sql.meta.provider.pubsub/PubsubJsonIT/testSQLLimit/history/). Closing this
