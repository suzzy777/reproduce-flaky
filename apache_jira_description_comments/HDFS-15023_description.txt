As discussed HDFS-14961, ZKFC should not join election when its state is observer.

Right now when namemode was an observer,  it joined election and it would be become a standby.

MonitorDaemon thread callchain is that
doHealthChecks -> enterState(State.SERVICE_HEALTHY) -> recheckElectability() -> elector.joinElection(targetToData(localTarget)) -> joinElectionInternal -> createLockNodeAsync

callBack for zookeeper
processResult -> becomeStandby
