    THRIFT-3746 JSON protocol left in incorrect state on read errors

    This is related to THRIFT-3735, but the problem was not fully addressed
    there. The JSON protocol's read buffer needs to be reset to avoid being
    put in an invalid state on read errors.
    
    This also changes how the writer is reset to match what we do with the
    reader for consistency.

    It seems that this change makes corss tests for Go server with JSON protocol + Buffered transport flaky.
    A normal RPC call right after oneway call sometimes fails to respond.
    
    @tylertreat-wf do you have any idea how this happens ?


Reverted as 3aa461b97b3230d357543808f1facf9898818f71 for now because of flaky cross tests for Go server with JSON buffered.

    @nsuke Interesting, I'm not entirely sure why this would be happening. I would expect the `writer` reset to be a safe operation to perform on `WriteMessageBegin`.
