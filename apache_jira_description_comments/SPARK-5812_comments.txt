I've updated the description to include the actual stacktrace in case the Jenkins report is GC'd.  This probably isn't an issue with {{glom()}} itself; instead, I think it's a non-deterministic error in TorrentBroadcast that usually seems to strike somewhere in JavaAPISuite.

AFAIK this flakiness hasn't been observed in a really long time, so let's close this for now.
