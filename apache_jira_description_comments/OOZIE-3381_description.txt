When using [{{$\{coord:latest\(n\)}}} coordinator EL function|https://oozie.apache.org/docs/5.0.0/CoordinatorFunctionalSpec.html#a6.6.6._coord:latestint_n_EL_Function_for_Synchronous_Datasets] inside an input dataset dependency, it's often the case that more information is needed how many HDFS URIs are being checked for each {{<data-in/>}}.

Right now we don't have this information. While debugging and fine tuning parameters like {{dataset frequency}}, {{initial-instance}}, and {{data-in}} {{instance}}, it would be very useful to know how many HDFS roundtrips are issues by the current settings {{CoordELFunctions#coord_latestRange_sync()}} and {{CoordELFunctions#coord_futureRange_sync()}} having called {{DFSClient#exists()}}. We need appropriate logging there.
