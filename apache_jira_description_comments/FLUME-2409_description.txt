When NettyAvroRpcClient works with a host that has only an IP address associated with it but no hostname, some operations take too long (a few seconds vs expected millis). This affects most of exceptions throwing and a part of logging.
This happens because of the unnecessary and expensive hostname lookup when converting NettyAvroRpcClient to String.
