Looks like all the 'testMaybeChangeDocs' tests have failed after this upgrade.

There seems to have been an implicit "-h" option for help in commons cli 1.3 and earlier, which is no longer provided by default. Without any arguments, it prints out the usage message by default. How useful is having an explicit "-h"?

Sorry, reassigned by mistake.

I wanted to ask for a careful revision of the release notes/change log between all those versions. There might be things we do not hit in testing, but that can affect us one way or another. Thank you in advance!

bq. How useful is having an explicit "-h"?

I think we can remove it, but also need to update the docs for sstablesplit: https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/tools/sstable/sstablesplit.html

[~brandon.williams] I found the problem, it was line wrapping that had changed in 1.5.0, so I reformatted the tests around this. Also added a -h option for sstablemetadata.

Also should there be a readme somewhere documenting how to run these tests?

I believe it is covered [here|https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/testing.html].  I'm getting conflicts trying to apply your PR now, can you rebase?



Ok, got the rebase sorted on slack, let's give this another shot:

org.apache.cassandra.tools.SSTableMetadataViewerTest is still failing and from the output it looks like -h is expecting an argument?

I think the expected output in the Test class needs to be updated to add '-h'
[junit-timeout] Testcase: testMaybeChangeDocs(org.apache.cassandra.tools.SSTableMetadataViewerTest)-.jdk1.8: FAILED
[junit-timeout] expected:<...> [-c] [-g <arg>] [-[s] [-t <arg>] [-u]

The docs for sstablemetadata should be updated with -h also.

I see a [failure|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1138/workflows/d08a9f2e-a358-460a-ad41-3baabc142afd/jobs/37737/tests] for SSTablePartitionsTest.

Just multiplexed units this time:

The circle script may have bitten off more than circle can chew, I see that the j8 vm died while multiplexing, and the j11 multiplexers are still running.  I have started all the non-multiplexed counterparts, and I don't think I'm concerned about flakiness being introduced into these tests since they are just matching output.

I cancelled the j11 multiplexer runs, but as I said I'm not concerned since the single passes are good. +1

Yeah guilty here for the tests for the detection of changed docs :-DDD Anyway it seems both CI runs make up for a green CI run. Also these tests can't be flaky as they only changed the checking of the output. +1

Committed, thanks everyone!
