Thank you [~asalamon74] for the contribution! I have left a nit comment and a question in the review. Can you please check it?

{noformat}
    private static final int TIME_IN_MIN = 60 * 1000;
    private static final int TIME_IN_HOURS = TIME_IN_MIN * 60;
    private static final int TIME_IN_DAY = TIME_IN_HOURS * 24;
{noformat}

Can't we just use {{java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit}} for such calculations? It's so much nicer:
{noformat}
    private static final int TIME_IN_MIN = TimeUnit.SECONDS(60).toMillis();
    private static final int TIME_IN_HOURS = TimeUnit.HOURS(1).toMillis();
    private static final int TIME_IN_DAY = TimeUnit.DAYS(1).toMillis();
{noformat}


testRetryConsoleUrlForked:org.apache.oozie.command.wf.TestWorkflowActionRetryInfoXCommand seems to be flaky. It failed 3 times out of 30. 

Using [java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html] would be nicer, but since we have a TimeUnit in Oozie as well, used in this test class, we will have to use the fully qualified name for one of them. What about opening a follow up Jira to make some cleaning around the internal TimeUnit classes as well?

I have created a follow-up issue (OOZIE-3383) for the TimeUnit related issue, so this issue can be considered done.

Thank you [~asalamon74] for the contribution. 

+1, committed to master

Closing issue; Oozie 5.2.0 is released
