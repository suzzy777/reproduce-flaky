Reproduced issue in ptest run which I made to run against tez staging artifacts (https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachetez-1068/)
http://ci.hive.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/hive-precommit/detail/PR-1311/14/pipeline/417

I'm about to investigate this. I think Tez 0.10.0 cannot be released until we won't confirm if it's a hive or tez bug.

{code}
mvn test -Pitests,hadoop-2 -Dtest=TestMmCompactorOnTez -pl ./itests/hive-unit
