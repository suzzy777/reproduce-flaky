The camel-xchange tests keep hitting the address https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/exchangeInfo which both abuse the owner of the address and contribute to their flakiness. 

To reproduce: 
1. Run the tests locally: they are likely to pass
2. Block the binance API address (see below)
3. Repeat the tests: they should fail with {{"org.knowm.xchange.exceptions.ExchangeException: Failed to initialize: Connection refused"}}


To block the address, you can add the following line to {{/etc/hosts}}:

{code:java}
127.0.0.1       fapi.binance.com
{code}
