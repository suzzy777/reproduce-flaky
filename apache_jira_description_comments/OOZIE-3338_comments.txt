I removed the SVN reference from the documentation and from the mkdistro.sh script.

I've also addressed several mkdistro.sh shellcheck issues.

Thanks for the contribution [~asalamon74]! Can you please verify whether using the patched {{bin/mkdistro.sh}} the variables {{VC_REV}} and {{VC_URL}} are being set correctly in the build artifacts? Thanks!

[~andras.piros] The patched {{bin/mkdistro.sh}} handles the variables correctly if the project if checked out from a git server.

If an artifact is created using  {{bin/create-release-artifact}} it is not possible to read the info from the git server. In this case the info is already hardwired into {{oozie-buildinfo.properties}} file (see OOZIE-3210).

Thanks for the contribution [~asalamon74]! +1

Committed to {{master}}.

Closing issue; Oozie 5.2.0 is released
