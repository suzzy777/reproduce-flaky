Currently in the global procedure framework, the procedure coordinator can send data (procedure argument) to the members when starting procedure.
But we don't support getting data returned from the procedure members back to the master.
Similar to RPC and normal procedure/function calls, in many cases, this is a useful capability.
The infrastructure is in place. We just need to plug in the holes and make it happen.
