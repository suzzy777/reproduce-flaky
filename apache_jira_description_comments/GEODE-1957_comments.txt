GEODE-1957: mark test as flaky


Closing due to inactivity.  Please reopen if this test fails again.

This issue has either failed to reproduce or been fixed systemically elsewhere (e.g. improving port selection and timeouts).  Closing but please reopen if needed.

This is a real failure and still fails.
