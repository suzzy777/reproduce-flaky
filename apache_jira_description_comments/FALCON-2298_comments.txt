Ideally this scenario shouldn't have come. This seems to be happening while the server is being started and loading all the already submitted entities and if its unable to restore, the file in the store has been edited or corrupted.
Any change to an entity has to be done by update command from the client.

This Scenario happened after upgrade of Falcon from one before the fix of FALCON-1793 to the one with the fix. Our feeds had retention set to archive but looks after this fix they are not valid and only supported is delete.

Thanks [~prabhujoseph] for the clarification. Makes sense. Would you like to take up the jira and contribute ? 

[~sandeep.samudrala] Yes sure, can you assign this to me.

    FALCON-2010 Fix UT errors due to ActiveMQ upgrade
    
    Fixed two test failures due to the upgrade:
    
    1. JMSMessageConsumerTest
    After upgrade, some messages are consumed faster and so the initial expectation on no message being dequeued right after the message sending doesn't hold. Also confirmed with bvellanki that this kind of tests are flaky and have caused intermittent test errors before. Therefore, removed getTotalDequeueCount assertion. In addition, the expected message consumptions are tested in existing code "Mockito.verify(jobEndService,...".
    
    2. FalconPostProcessingTest
    After upgrade, Falcon will run into an error if it tries to delete messages when ActiveMQ service is stopped. Therefore, need to call start before deleting the message during teardown.

    FALCON-1931 : Adding multiCluster tag for Multiple Cluster scenarios
    
    In the regression test suite, there are lot of places multiCluster annotation has been defined to denote it uses multiple cluster. It is very useful annotation since we require additional cluster and setup to test the test case . Some of the major test cases such as feed replication and Hive DR are missing this annotation.

    FALCON-2051 PostProcessing needs to send JMS message so that REPL metrics can be added to the GraphDB
    
    Basically, reverted the FALCON-1926 changes.
    We will attempt to solve it properly by not sending JMS message from Falcon PostProcessing after 0.10 release.
