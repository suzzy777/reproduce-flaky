    @kavinkumarks Thanks for the contribution, the Paragraph ID is actually already shown in the UI

    @corneadoug thanks for the update.I will remove the changes done for it.Could someone review the other change that I have done as part of this?


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    In the backend part, it looks good. But I suggest you add unit test for that api and docs for it.


Github user kavinkumarks commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1262
  
    @jongyoul Added the unit test and updated docs.Also reverted the UI code.Could you please check them?


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    Could you please revise the title first?

    Have updated the title, please let me know if I am missing anything else.

    @doanduyhai I've found an error that I've never seen it while testing CassandraInterpreter. Can you check that file : https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/150544950/log.txt ?
    
    ```
    Tests in error: 
      CassandraInterpreterTest.org.apache.zeppelin.cassandra.CassandraInterpreterTest Â» ExceptionInInitializer
      CassandraInterpreterTest.org.apache.zeppelin.cassandra.CassandraInterpreterTest Â» NoClassDefFound
    ```
    
    And concerning another profile, there's flaky test error.
    
    ```
    Failed tests: 
      ZeppelinSparkClusterTest.zRunTest:205 expected:<[10]> but was:<[
    
    
    <console>:26: error: not found: value a
           print(a)
                 ^
    ]>
    ```

    @kavinkumarks Your changes LGTM, but could you please trigger the CI again?


Github user doanduyhai commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1262
  
    @jongyoul 
    
    `caused by: com.datastax.driver.core.exceptions.NoHostAvailableException: All host(s) tried for query failed (tried: localhost/127.0.0.1:9107 (com.datastax.driver.core.exceptions.OperationTimedOutException: [localhost/127.0.0.1] Timed out waiting for server response))
    `
    
    The CI server is overloaded so the embedded Cassandra did not start in timely manner. Usually re-launching the test make it work



Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1262
  
    @doanduyhai Thanks for the quick response. I see what happened. Is there any way to avoid this failure by conservative code?


Github user doanduyhai commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1262
  
    @jongyoul The only  way to avoid this failure is to block the unit tests until the embedded Cassandra server is up, which can take time and sometimes end in a dead-lock situation.
    
    Another solution is to set a timeout for the embedded Cassandra server to start and skip all the unit tests in case of failure but I'm not fond of skipping tests because they are here to guarantee no regression


Github user doanduyhai commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1262
  
    By the way, those issues are all related to the fact that we are running our software factory on a shared/mutualized infrastructure (Travis). I have the same issue of random failures due to resource starvation with my own personnal projects


Github user kavinkumarks commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1262
  
    @jongyoul I dont see the option to restart the build in travis since I don't have the write access to repo.And I didn't find any way other than doing some hacks.Could you please let me know how to do it?


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:
