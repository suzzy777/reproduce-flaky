When JWT authentication is configured and the "jwks_url" startup flag is specified, Impala is not verifying the JWKS server's TLS certificate.

[https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/e17fd9a0d5428306dfa41a041a44c800824d72f6/be/src/util/jwt-util.cc#L557]

Add a new startup flag that enables the user to select whether or not they wish to verify the JWKS server's TLS certificate.  Default this option to verifying the certificate.  *This is a breaking change as current behavior skips TLS certificate verifications.*
