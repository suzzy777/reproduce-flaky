Surefire does not recognize successful tests using TestNG with the invocationCount and successPercentage parameters on the @Test annotation. BugTest.java in the attached file has an invocationCount = 100 with a successPercentage = 1. 1 test in 100 needs to pass for the test to be considered successful. However when running *{{mvn clean test}}* Surefire reports the tests as failed. The generated report shows the tests as passing. Surefire should be identifying this test as passing.
