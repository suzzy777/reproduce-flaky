I saw a failure in the same test just now.

I marked the build as keep forever, so please unmark when you are done with it -https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-from-scratch/10747/testReport/junit/custom_cluster.test_event_processing/TestEventProcessing/test_transactional_insert_events/

I looked into this and I think I found the problem. In case of transactional tables, the events are generated in a transactional context. So for example, in case of an insert into a transactional table, we see a sequence of OPEN_TXN, ALLOCATE_WRITE_ID, ALTER_PARTITION, COMMIT_TXN event on that table. Currently EventsProcessor refreshes the table when we see ALTER_PARTITION however, it is possible that the transaction has not been committed by that time. Hence we will skip the new files which were added by the insert after the reload. The solution is to wait until we see a COMMIT_TXN event before refreshing the tables. I will send out a fix for this soon.

[~vihangk1] did you end up figuring out a fix? Is this still an issue?

I understand the problem but unfortunately I don't have a good fix on this yet. Let me investigate more and report back.

IMPALA-9057: Disable test_transactional_insert_events

The test test_transactional_insert_events fails
intermittently. The root cause of the flakiness is
documented in the JIRA. Disabling this test until we
have the fix for the underlying cause of the problem.

Testing:
Confirmed that the test is skipped and marked as XFAIL
when test_events_processing is run.

Just to update the latest here, I found that HMS has new a API which was introduced in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-25137 which gives the clients the ability to fetch the WriteId information given the commit transaction id. Using this API we can enhance the MetastoreEventsProcessor to fetch ACID_WRITE events from HMS and refresh the ACID tables, when commit transaction event is received. This should fix the race condition described above.

I will see if we can bump up the GBN which includes the new HMS API.

IMPALA-11093: Fine grained table refreshing doesn't refresh table file
metadata

If we insert data into an acid partitioned table from Hive, the
generated events will be like open_txn -> alter_partition
-> commit_txn.

Previously we assumed the partition object with the alter_partition
event has write id < current write id. However, that is not a valid
assumption, the partition object is actually the write id allocated
in this transaction. That means in commit_txn event, we will have
a partition with write id equals to the write id of cached partition.
So we need to modify the '<' condition to '<='.

Tests:
After IMPALA-10923, we now refresh file metadata while processing
commit events. Therefore, we can add back the test disabled in
IMPALA-9057.
