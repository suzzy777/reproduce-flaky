Noting that the problem was in mockito argument captor verification, a practice that is explicitly not supported across multiple threads.

[~boyuanz] Would you mind taking a look?

This is not currently failing, as I've re-disabled parallel builds. But it is expected that fixing or sickbaying such tests will allow parallel builds.

I'll take a look.

Downgrading to minor as the basic race condition is solved and our current use doesn't seem to actually break Mockito. The tests are pretty laborious and probably test our mocking as much as the code under test, so still worth a look at some point.

Is this still an issue? Can we close it?
