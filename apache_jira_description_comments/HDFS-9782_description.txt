Right now it defaults to rolling at the top of every hour.  Instead that interval should be configurable.  The interval should also allow for some play so that all hosts don't try to flush their files simultaneously.

I'm filing this in HDFS because I suspect it will involve touching the HDFS tests.  If it turns out not to, I'll move it into common instead.
