how is a mesos feature request?  mesos doesn't directly do anything with jenkins.  This is likely a mesos jenkins plugin feature request.

[~kensipe] It is targeted at updating the configurations on https://builds.apache.org/. We don't have a better place to capture those requests.

adding to current sprint as a way to tackle some of the flaky tests.

Use something like this on Jenkins. This can be generalized and put in Mesos ./support folder.

{code}
cmd="MESOS_VERBOSE=1 GLOG_v=1 make check GTEST_SHUFFLE=1"

start=$(date +"%s")
$cmd &

pid=$!

duration=$((160 * 60))

while [ $(($(date +"%s") - $start)) -lt $duration ]; do
  running=`jobs | grep "Running" | wc -l`
  if [ $running -eq 0 ]; then exit 0; fi
  sleep 10
done

echo "Process still running after $duration seconds. Attaching gdb..."

tmp=`mktemp -t XXXXX`
echo "thread apply all bt" > $tmp; gdb attach $pid < $tmp

echo "Killing the process"

kill $pid
{code}
