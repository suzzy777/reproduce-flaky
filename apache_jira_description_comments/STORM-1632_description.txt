EventLogging has performance penalty. For a simple speed of light topology  with a single instances of a spout and a bolt, disabling event logging delivers a 7% to 9% perf improvement (with acker count =1)

Event logging can be enabled when there is need to do debug, but turned off by default.


**Update:** with acker=0  the observed impact was much higher... **25%** faster when event loggers = 0
