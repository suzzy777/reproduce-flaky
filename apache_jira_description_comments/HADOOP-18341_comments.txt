   @ashutoshcipher would you be able to review this? - I've seen you've been busy working on other lib upgrades. This PR is only aimed at hadoop 3.4 and not something that needs to go to hadoop 3.3.




ashutoshcipher commented on PR #4578:
URL: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/4578#issuecomment-1251557986

   Thanks @pjfanning. I can help in reviewing. My only concern here is that - As there is no security related issue or any major bug encountered in the current version. Is it worth upgrading - As sometimes some upgrades not being backward compatible makes the downstream projects using hadoop painful. 




pjfanning commented on PR #4578:
URL: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/4578#issuecomment-1251577861

   Thanks @ashutoshcipher - thanks for looking. Just in case, this is from the issue description.
   
   Current version 2.1.1 has no CVEs but all higher versions have CVEs except for the latest release 2.8.0. Still feels like it would be safer to upgrade.
   
   The evidence so far appears that there are no breaking changes in commons-configuration2 and commons-text that would make this upgrade problematic.
   
   If you think this change is not worth the hassle it may cause to downstream projects, that's ok.

   Thanks @pjfanning for more explanation about this upgrade. 
   
   Given 
   
   >Current version 2.1.1 has no CVEs but all higher versions have CVEs except for the latest release 2.8.0. Still feels like it would be safer to upgrade.
   
   and 
   
   > The evidence so far appears that there are no breaking changes in commons-configuration2 and commons-text that would make this upgrade problematic.
   
   I am +1 for trunk.

   Thanks for your PR and your discussion, @pjfanning and @ashutoshcipher.
   
   Our source code analyzer also detected CVE-2022-33980 in commons-configuration2-2.1.1. I do not think this vulnerability affects Hadoop, but we should upgrade it to 2.8.0.
   
   Some minor comments about this PR,
   - Is the TestTimelineWebServices fix related to the commons-configuration upgrade? If not, we should not include it in this PR.
   - Since this is a security fix, it should be backported to lower branches. Could you please create a PR to backport to branch-3.3, branch-3,2, and branch-2.10?

   I've removed the change to TestTimelineWebServices
