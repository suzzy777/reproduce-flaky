In order to help validate metric upgrade we first need to know what is new, what was removed, and what was changed.  To help with this, we should add a new jmxtool which can dump the objects from JMX and diff them.

Once we have this, we can also add a gold list of expected metrics and add tests to validate these metrics donâ€™t change.
