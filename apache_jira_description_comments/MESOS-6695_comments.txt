    Changed registrar backend to `in_memory` by default in tests.
    
    Currently, all instances of the Master in tests set the
    `--registry` flag to the default value (`replicated_log`).
    When the `replicated_log` value is set, Masters in tests will
    back the registrar with the disk, specifically via levelDB.
    
    Only a small subset of tests actually require the `replicated_log`;
    these are tests which expect the master to persist data across
    failovers.  A majority of tests can be run with an `in_memory`
    registrar backend.  Changing the default to `in_memory` will
    serve multiple purposes:
    * It will speed up the test suite by ~10-15%.
    * It will reduce the flakiness observed on the ASF CI.
      These machines sometimes run into disk contention, which causes
      registrar reads/write to time out.
    * It will unblock a majority of tests from being run on Windows,
      which currently does not implement a persistent registrar backend.
