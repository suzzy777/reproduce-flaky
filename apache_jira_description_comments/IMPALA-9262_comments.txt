IMPALA-9262: De-flake TestBlacklist::test_kill_impalad_with_running_queries

test_blacklist.py::TestBlacklist::test_kill_impalad_with_running_queries
runs a query asynchronously, waits for it to reach the RUNNING or FINISHED
state, kills an impalad, and then expects a fetch results request for
the query to fail. The test is flaky because it is possible the query can
finish successfully before an impalad is successfully killed.

The fix is to make the query slower using a debug action.

Testing:
* Looped the test for several hours

Still seems to be happening, different error now though:

IMPALA-9262: Bump statestore_heartbeat_frequency_ms in test_kill_impalad_with_running_queries

CustomClusterTestSuite sets statestore_heartbeat_frequency_ms to 50,
overriding the default value of 1000. This means that if a node does not
respond to heartbeats for 500 milliseconds, it will time out and be
removed from the cluster (vs the default of 10 seconds).

A low value for statestore_heartbeat_frequency_ms is problematic for
test_kill_impalad_with_running_queries because if a node is removed from
the cluster membership, it is removed from the blacklist as well. The
test asserts that "Blacklisted Executors" shows up in the runtime
profile of a query immediately after running a query that causes a node
to be blacklisted. Thus, there is a race condition between running the
test query vs. the node being removed from the cluster membership.
Increasing the value of statestore_heartbeat_frequency_ms should
significantly reduce the chances of such a race.

Testing:
* Ran test_kill_impalad_with_running_queries locally
* Not actually able to re-produce the flakiness locally

Issue didn't occur over the weekend (it was happening almost every day before the most recent fix).
