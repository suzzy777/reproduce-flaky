JDBC test suite went flaky after IGNITE-14575. On the first look it seems like there is a race condition: ClientImpl notifies listeners (notably, DistributedMetaStorage) about `EVT_NODE_JOINED` before `state` is set to `CONNECTED`. This way, distributed meta storage tries to perform write operations and ClientImpl is not ready yet.
