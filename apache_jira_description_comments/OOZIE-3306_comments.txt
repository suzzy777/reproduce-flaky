I've created a patch which makes it possible to specify the maven dependency plugin version using -Dmaven-dependency-plugin.version=2.10 . For grind it is possible to set it using GRIND_MAVEN_FLAGS:

{noformat}
export GRIND_MAVEN_FLAGS=-Dmaven-dependency-plugin.version=2.10
{noformat}

Thanks for the contribution [~asalamon74]! Can you please address pre-commit issues? Thanks!

Thanks for checking [~andras.piros]. I've uploaded a new version of the patch which fixes the tabs, trailing spaces, and too long lines issues.

Thanks [~asalamon74]! Can you please also elaborate how to set [*{{GRIND_MAVEN_FLAGS}}*|https://github.com/cloudera/dist_test/blob/master/docs/grind.md#environment-variables] and how does a sample {{grind}} command look like? Thanks!

Thanks [~andras.piros]! I've uploaded a new patch which shows a sample grind command.
