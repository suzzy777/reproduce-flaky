See [https://travis-ci.org/ursa-labs/arrow-r-nightly/jobs/649649349#L373-L375] for an example on public CI. I was seeing this locally this week but figured I'd screwed up my env somehow.

{code}
── 1. Failure: Lists are preserved when writing/reading from Parquet (@test-parq
  `object` not equivalent to `expected`.
  Component "num": Component 1: target is numeric, current is character
{code}

It's not always the same column in the data.frame that is affected. Also strange that it's only one column. You'd think that if it were transposing the order somehow, you'd get two that were swapped.

The test itself is straightforward (https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/tests/testthat/test-parquet.R#L124-L137) so this is somewhat troubling.
