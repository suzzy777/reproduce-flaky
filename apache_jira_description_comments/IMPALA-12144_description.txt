There is a sign of flakiness in TestTpcdsQueryWithProcessingCost within dockerised environment:

[https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-dockerised-tests/7393/] 
[https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-dockerised-tests/7395/] 
[https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-dockerised-tests/7397/] 
[https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-dockerised-tests/7398/] 

We should consider skipping this test in dockerised environment since dockerised setup seems to have tighter per-process memory limit.
