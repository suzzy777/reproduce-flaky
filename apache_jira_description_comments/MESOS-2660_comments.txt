Resource temporarily unavailable is EAGAIN, which from digging, is actually ENOMEM:

http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a477097d9c37c1cf289c7f0257dffcfa42d50197

{code}
 	ret = get_user_pages(current, current->mm, addr,
 			len, write, 0, NULL, NULL);
-	if (ret < 0)
+	if (ret < 0) {
+		/*
+		   SUS require strange return value to mlock
+		    - invalid addr generate to ENOMEM.
+		    - out of memory should generate EAGAIN.
+		*/
+		if (ret == -EFAULT)
+			ret = -ENOMEM;
+		else if (ret == -ENOMEM)
+			ret = -EAGAIN;
 		return ret;
-	return ret == len ? 0 : -1;
+	}
+	return ret == len ? 0 : -ENOMEM;
 }
{code}

so my theory was mlock makes sure enough lockable memory is present before locking, but since I requested more than the limit to trigger the oom, the validation fails with EAGAIN(ENOMEM). 

Therefor I swapped the order in the code to memset first before mlock and it worked. Changing this order shouldn't make a difference when there is enough memory since both cases would go through; when there isn't, memset triggers page faults and gets the process under oom, which is expected.

(not sure why this wasn't picked up when I wrote the the test -_-)

    Changed MemoryTestHelper to do memset before mlock.
    
    In allocateRSS, when requested memory is more than the limit, mlock
    returns error because it couldn't find enough lockable memory, which
    defeats the purpose to trigger an oom.

This still fails on Ubuntu 12.04, although not flaky, but every time.

Depending on the load of the host the test either fails or passes. Doing mlockall() (the review I posted) works for Listen test, but it might have undesirable consequences for other tests. Still looking.

Added a fix for flaky cgroups memory pressure test as well. All memory-related tests seem to be OK now.

    Fixed cgroups oom killer and memory pressure tests on Ubuntu 14.04.
