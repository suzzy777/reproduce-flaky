The test container providing support for XMPP tests is very outdated, lack support for health checks and is flaky. 

Ideally, we should rework the way this test container work so that it doesn't make the tests unstable.

Lastly, it is also missing support for ARM and other platforms we use, which reduce our test coverage.
