~halve the number of retained builds across our pipeline jobs.

Concurrently, I'll also try to prune some old branches.

I thought the issue was that our build retention settings were being ignored? have you confirmed that we're actually keeping this number of builds?

{quote}I thought the issue was that our build retention settings were being ignored
{quote}
Infra was guessing that the "discard old builds" property on the Jenkins config wasn't working. The pointers they made were to the properties that we already have set.
{quote}have you confirmed that we're actually keeping this number of builds?
{quote}
While I did not count every single job, nightlies were the configured value (30), and the others were in the right ballpark.

+1 let's see how it goes

Ok, I see this reflected in [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/job/master/configure] and [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/master/configure]. Going to cherry-pick this around everywhere.

SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build HBase-1.3-IT #581 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-1.3-IT/581/])
HBASE-22563 Reduce old builds by half (elserj: rev 149d756bc3b9b2ad81f2a24a2a4dcfe83abe08a9)
