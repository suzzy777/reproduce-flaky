The application mode fails fatally when being shut down (e.g. if the {{Dispatcher}} loses its leadership). The problem seems to be that the {{ApplicationDispatcherBootstrap}} cancels the {{applicationExecutionTask}} and {{applicationCompletionFuture}} that can trigger the execution of the fatal exception handler in the handler of the {{applicationCompletionFuture}}.

I suggest to only call the fatal exception handler if an unexpected exception occurs in the {{applicationCompletionFuture}} callback.
