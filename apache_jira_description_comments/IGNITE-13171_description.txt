Current implementation of a optimized rebalancing with disabled WAL used when all local partitions are MOVING and persistence is enabled has multiple flaws:
 # There are races between concurrent topology change and partition owning after a checkpoint causing consistency issues.
 # Partitions will not be owned after a topology has changed and new topology version is compatible with previous.

This is the reason for flaky tests [1] [2]
