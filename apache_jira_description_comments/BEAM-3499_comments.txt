jkff opened a new pull request #4483: [BEAM-3499, BEAM-2607] Gives the runner access to positions of SDF claimed blocks
URL: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4483
 
 
   This addresses the following issues:
   
   * https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3499 Watch can make no progress if a single poll takes more than checkpoint interval
   * https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2607 Enforce that SDF must return stop() after a failed tryClaim() call
   
   The former is the primary motivation for this PR. This PR changes SDF checkpointing timer countdown to start from the first claimed block, rather than from the beginning of `@ProcessElement`. This requires giving the runner visibility into claimed blocks. Such visibility enables fixing BEAM-2607 as well. It also is a required part of implementing SDF splitting over Fn API (tracked separately).
   
   This PR also, of course, changes the Watch transform to the new API; and, while we're at it, does some related improvements:
   
   * Compresses Watch.GrowthState using Snappy. E.g. with 100k files, the encoded state is about 3MB instead of 8MB. Compressing it much more is difficult because the state includes uncompressible hashes. To address this, one must shard the filepattern, or implement the improvements suggested in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2680 .
   * Makes direct runner create a clone of state cells - I did this mainly because I noticed that GrowthStateCoder was never called on the Watch state, which risks missing coder bugs when testing with direct runner.
   
   This PR is update-incompatible for users of the Watch transform, e.g. FileIO.match().continuously(). This is an experimental and very recent transform, so I'm going to ignore the incompatibility. It also requires a traditional Dataflow worker dance to get the worker container in sync with these runners-core changes - I'll perform that when the rest of the PR is approved.
