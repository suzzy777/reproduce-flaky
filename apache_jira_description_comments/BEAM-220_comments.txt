I have seen this failure in travis builds in PR too. Not sure why this fails only on travis. Nothing suspicious yet in the log.  

This failure is actually from Jenkins.

    [BEAM-220] fix flaky KafkaIO test

    Fix a flaky KafkaIO test.
    
    KafkaIO reader reads from Kafka in a separate thread. As a result, `start()` or `advance()` might not read a record with in 10 millis timeout even from the mock kafka consumer. Updated one test that manually reads from KafkaIO reader to invoke `advance()` in a loop.
    
    This should fix the flaky test. I am running these tests in a loop on my desktop to verify. One thing I can not explain is the following log from the failed jenkins build linked in BEAM-220 (the log was same when I reproduced it locally):
    
        Apr 22, 2016 7:04:10 AM org.apache.beam.sdk.io.kafka.KafkaIO$UnboundedKafkaReader advance
        INFO: Reader-0: first record offset 0
    
    It is entirely clear if this is from the failed test, but `first record offset 0` implies the `start()` must have returned true.
