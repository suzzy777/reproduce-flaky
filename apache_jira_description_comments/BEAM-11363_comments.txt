There are additional tests that suffer from this. They appear to be GCP integration tests, but have Test in the class name and so run under the :test task:

DicomIOTest. test_Dicom_failedMetadataRead
FhirIOTest. test_FhirIO_failedReads
FhirIOTest. test_FhirIO_failedWrites
HL7v2IOTest. test_HL7v2IO_failedReads
HL7v2IOTest. test_HL7v2IO_failedWrites

Let's track those here as well.

Folks, is this causing problems like flaky or failing tests? I am trying to understand the severity of the problem.

If I recall, our contribution guide used to recommend running `./gradlew check` to ensure all things were set up properly. I don't think anyone actively developing Beam does this, because it doesn't work. I do think it is a good goal for basic tests to be hermetic and pass.

I don't think it's causing any flakes (perhaps it increrases PreCommit runtime though? not sure).

Really I think the impact is just what Kenn mentioned: it's a bad experience for new contributors for ./gradlew check to not work (BEAM-11402), especially when we specifically advertise it.

This Jira ticket has a pull request attached to it, but is still open. Did the pull request resolve the issue? If so, could you please mark it resolved? This will help the project have a clear view of its open issues.
