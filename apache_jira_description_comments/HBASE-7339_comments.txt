This was encountered when testing online snapshots, but will affect offline snapshots as well.

Suggested solutions:
1) Make opening the hfile-link daughter reference more robust, by attempting to treat as a reference if treating as link fails.  Hacky but "should" work.
2) Change the regex's used to differentiate references and hfilelinks more strict so that we can differentiate. Hacky, not sure if it will work.
3) Change daughter reference link file name to be more robust.  Currently '<hfile>.<parentregion>', maybe chanage to '<hfile>@<parentregion>'. This would then allow '<hfile>\-<region>\-<table>@<parentreigon>' to be interpreted correctly.  This is the "right way" but breaks compatibility

Other follow-ons -- ideally we are more robust by quarantining a bad region or hfiles/linksfiles if it has killed a few nodes in the cluster.

I'm going to pursue #1 and then #2 first.

Attached patch that implemented approach #1.

Review board here : https://reviews.apache.org/r/8614/

Why would #3 break compatibility?  hfilelink is not in a release yet.  Could we not differentiate old and new style references -- the one w/ '.' delimiter and the other w/ '@' delimiter ('@' is probably not a good character to use in filename given that hdfs filenames are url parts).  Let me take a looksee at your approach #1 patch.

#3's suggestion was to change how reference file names were encoded -- from <hfile>.<parentregion> to <hfile>@<parentregion>.  This would break compat because old refs would have a different file name pattern.

NOTE: Encoding all this info into the filename was a trick used to avoid the costly opreations of opening and reading the contents of the files -- now we can just do a single dir listing and have enough information to link to the orginal file.

The problem now is that a valid table names concatted with a '.' to a valid regions names is also a valid table name, and lead to the incorrect interpretation.

{code}
true hfile name constraints: [0-9]+(?:_SeqID_[0-9]+)?
region name constraints    : [a-f0-9]{16}  (but we currently just use [a-f0-9]+.)
table name constraints     : [a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*
{code}

Notice that the table name constraints completely covers all region name constraints and true hfile name constraints.   (a valid hfile name is a valid part of a table name, and a valid enc region name is a valid part of a table name.

Currently the hfilelink filename convention is <hfile>-<region>-<table>.  Unfortunately, making a ref to this uses the name <hfile>-<region>-<table>.<parentregion> -- the contactnation of <table>.<parentregion> is a valid table name used to get interpreted as such.  My first thought on #3 was that if we introduced a char such as '@' to separate the <table> from the <parentregion>, our regex parsers would simply work.

Regardless of what we do, we need to add some char invalid for table names to the hfilelink or reference filename convention.

hm.. it seems like if we changed the order of the hfile-link name we could avoid some of the confusion -- <table>@<region>-<hfile>.<parentregion> (or some other separator char than '@') could be used to avoid handling on the initial filenotfoundexception but I think we'd still need a good chunk of the logic to handle opening half-storefile reader throw a hfilelink.

I was able to verify that hfile-links are properly compacted, and that references to hfile links are compacted. 

Here's some rough evidence:

During a splits you can see refs to hfile links (the two a517dce192074812bc57256f5811a526-2b380883b191a2153df51a1de9e530b4-TestTable.b4fb30c8cac85edbe9d21fbf49c85dbf files -- one is top the other is bottom)

I've filled a follow on HBASE-7419 to revisit the hfile-link name format to make regexes cleaner.

commit currently blocked by test failures HBASE-7388, HBASE-7418.

Committed to hbase-6055.  After several runs, it the failing tests are flaky on trunk and before this patch goes in.

Marking closed.
