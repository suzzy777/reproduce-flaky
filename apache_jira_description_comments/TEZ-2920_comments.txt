Don't see why the test is failing. Increasing the timeout for now - since the test relies on timing - at least 2 seconds. That could cause failures depending on the load on the boxes.
Not sure of the effort involved to write the same test without being reliant on a real clock - but that would be worthwhile to avoid such random failures.

Looks like one more flaky test \cc [~zjffdu]. 

That's covered by TEZ-2987.

Test failures are unrelated. [~hitesh] - can you take a look please. The patch increases the timeout only; I walked through the test and didn't see any other obvious problem.
If the test fails again, this can be re-opened.

Committed to master.

Closing as released.
