    IMPALA-5262: test_analytic_order_by_random fails with assert
    
    This was a poorly written test that relies on assumptions about
    the behavior of 'rand' and the order that rows get processed in
    a table that Impala doesn't actually guarantee.
    
    The new version is still sensitive to the precise behavior of
    'rand()', but shouldn't be flaky unless that behavior is changed.
