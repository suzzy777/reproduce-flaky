Pull request seems ok, though test is needed to prevent regression. 

I've worked on this issue and created the [PR|https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/9908] posted in the description. I would like to assign this ticket to myself but not sure how, or if I have the access to do so. Any help would be appreciated

I'm confused as to why the tests are failing, since I'm making a small code change. I'm fairly new to Open Source contributing, so if someone could perhaps explain to me why some tests are failing (as the tests that failed are not flaky), it would be great. 

If my code change really did make some tests fail, does that mean I should make changes to those tests as well?

[~alinaliBQ] you need to be added to a contributors group to be able to assign tickets to yourself. Please refer to https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/IGNITE/How+to+Contribute

Regerding tests - do not worry, there are flaky tests that sometimes fail. Try using "Re-run possible blockers" option in PR Check. The real issue I see here is "No new tests found!" label. You need to add a test for the fixed case to commit this fix.

[~isapego]  Ok, thanks for the explanation! I'll see what I can do regarding the test

I have written a unit test for the fix. 

[~alinaliBQ] looks good overall. I've left a request for a minor change in PR though.

Thanks [~isapego]! I have made the change in the PR
