Would result in test flakiness without resolving FLINK-24038 first.

I am the [Flink Jira Bot|https://github.com/apache/flink-jira-bot/] and I help the community manage its development. I see this issue is assigned but has not received an update in 30 days, so it has been labeled "stale-assigned".
If you are still working on the issue, please remove the label and add a comment updating the community on your progress.  If this issue is waiting on feedback, please consider this a reminder to the committer/reviewer. Flink is a very active project, and so we appreciate your patience.
If you are no longer working on the issue, please unassign yourself so someone else may work on it.

[~dmvk] This is only missing backports to 1.13 and potentially 1.12, correct?

Yes, it is missing backports to {{1.13}} and {{1.12}}.

I'll still try to do a backport for 1.13, unless it's too much effort (this code has evolved a lot during past couple of releases). 1.12 is not supported anymore by the community, so I don't think we need to invest in that.
