alter_table-randomized-test is flaky due to a short scan sometimes taking 10+ seconds. I added a pstack call to the unit test in 71e88d65d4f732751519da34c8e5974969bdfa96 and the stack trace shows that the RPC thread is stuck in the Scanner destructor. The call stack eventually leads to LogBlock::~LogBlock() -> DeleteBlock() -> fallocate64. We should somehow get this potentially very slow call off the RPC critical path.
