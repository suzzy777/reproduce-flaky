Problem Statement:

Hive would be easier to use if it had native Parquet support. Our organization, Criteo, uses Hive extensively. Therefore we built the Parquet Hive integration and would like to now contribute that integration to Hive.

About Parquet:

Parquet is a columnar storage format for Hadoop and integrates with many Hadoop ecosystem tools such as Thrift, Avro, Hadoop MapReduce, Cascading, Pig, Drill, Crunch, and Hive. Pig, Crunch, and Drill all contain native Parquet integration.

Changes Details:

Parquet was built with dependency management in mind and therefore only a single Parquet jar will be added as a dependency.
