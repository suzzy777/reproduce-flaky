GEODE-4817: Add support for SSL to the experimental driver. (#1683)

* GEODE-4817: Add support for SSL to the experimental driver.
- Adding a test that a locator can shut itself down
  with SSL. In order to use a locator with SSL, the
  locator must trust itself. Modifying the truststore
  and adding a test of shutting down a locator with SSL.
- The locator needs to trust itself. Fixing the
  truststore so that this test can shutdown.

has a bad ssl certificate.

* GEODE-4817: Adding protocols and cipher parameters to the experimental driver

Adding parameters that let the user restrict the protocols and ciphers
used.
