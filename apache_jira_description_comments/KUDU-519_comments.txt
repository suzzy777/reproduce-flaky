@jd hum, weird seems like the replica has more commits than the leader, both are correct though

@dralves if you restart a follower, it should get back into RUNNING state, no?

seems like the commit was queued but likely not appended. likely won't address that since that is a perfectly legal and plausible occurrence without replicated commits. In fact those two particular assertions in the test will disappear.

not stuck in CONFIGURING?

@todd if you look at the log the follower was not stuck.

the weird things is that it had a commit that the leader didn't have
and it couldn't have been stuck in configuring or the other txn wouldn't have completed
my suspicion is that we added the commit to the leaders repliacation queue but somehow it never landed in the wal
(in the leader's wal that is)
@jd can you file a bug anyway plz?

I see this in the flaky test dashboard as well (eg http://a1228.halxg.cloudera.com:8080/download_log?key=81b147d8-4815-11e4-9074-28924ad1fba8)

I don't believe this is flaky anymore in trunk. Ran a bunch of iters and no failures.
