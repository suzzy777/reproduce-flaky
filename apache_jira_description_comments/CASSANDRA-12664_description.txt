{{GCCompactionTest}} was introduced by CASSANDRA-7019 and appears to be flaky, see for example [here|https://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/sbtourist/job/sbtourist-CASSANDRA-9318-trunk-testall/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.cql3/GcCompactionTest/testGcCompactionStatic/]. 

I think it's the same root cause as CASSANDRA-12282: the tables in the test keyspace are dropped asynchronously after each test, and this might cause additional flush operations for all dirty tables in the keyspace. See the [callstack|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-12282?focusedCommentId=15399098&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15399098] in 12282. 

A possible solution is to use KEYSPACE_PER_TEST, which is instead dropped synchronously.
