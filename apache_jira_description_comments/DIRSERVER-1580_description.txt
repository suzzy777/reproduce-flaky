JUnit tests are failing on Windows due to attempts to delete files while they are still open.

Investigation reveals that the first test, KerberosServerConfigReaderTest, which succeeded left files open in the working directory and subsequent test fail while trying to clean out the working directory.  The problem appears to be with SingleFileLdifPartition which opens the file for access and provides no explicit means of closing it other than the "doDestroy()" method which is "protected" and therefore not available to the application to explicitly close the partition file.


Also, the CreateKdcServerAnnotationTest was failing due to a file being left open but I was able to solve this one by inserting the line

        directoryService.shutdown();

after the call to

        server.stop();
