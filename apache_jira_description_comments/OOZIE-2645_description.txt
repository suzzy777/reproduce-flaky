OOZIE-1817 added the option to use DropWizard Metrics instead of our homegrown Instrumentation.  We left the Instrumentation as the default for compatibility; in Oozie 5, we should drop Instrumentation and only have Metrics.

We can also use this opportunity to clean up the code and interface for Metrics, which currently has to conform to Instrumentation for pluggability.

----

Update: for 5.0.0 we only deprecate {{InstrumentationService}}, and make {{MetricsInstrumentationService}} the default.
