Precommit fails. Something related to cloudpickle.

Pickler is not set to cloudpickle and default pickler should be used but cloudpickle was used. May be we missed something?

Based on the [history|https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Cron/5217/testReport/junit/apache_beam.transforms.create_test/CreateTest/history/] it looks like this is not permanently failing, but very flaky. The first failure is here https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Cron/5213/ with commit https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/2269b04313f319f8b5ca7fba4fa0a2db8633dfb7

Do we think that could cause this? If so could we try rolling it back?

the failing test is flaky when this [test case|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/2269b04313f319f8b5ca7fba4fa0a2db8633dfb7/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/portability/stager_test.py#L242] not commented.

If I comment that particular test case, every thing works. I am not sure about the behavior though. 

[~bhulette] can you comment this [test case|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/2269b04313f319f8b5ca7fba4fa0a2db8633dfb7/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/portability/stager_test.py#L242] and confirm every thing works fine? If yes, I will skip that test case during precommit for now

Somehow setting the pickle library to cloudpickle here in this test case is making cloudpickle as global pickle library for every test case.  

So the reason why precommit fails because

in stager_test.py, this [test case|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/6c9c208197d3d74b1c3643d22716ad3b00213506/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/portability/stager_test.py#L242] declares cloudpickle as the default pickle library. Because of that, in  [pickler.py|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/6c9c208197d3d74b1c3643d22716ad3b00213506/sdks/python/apache_beam/internal/pickler.py#L36], the global variable is set to cloudpickle and for all other test case, cloudpickle is used as the default pickle library and test fails. 

So skipping the test case until cloudpickle becomes default pickle library

Is there  a jira for cloudpickle work that we can mark this as blocked by?

Marked this as P2 since test has been sickbayed.
