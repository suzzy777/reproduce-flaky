When we provide in a hive action:
 * --files /etc/spark2/conf/hive-site.xml#hive-site.xml or
 * <file>/etc/spark2/conf/hive-site.xml#hive-site.xml</file> or
* <file>hdfs:///tmp/spark2/conf/hive-site.xml#hive-site.xml</file> or
 * <archive>/etc/spark2/conf/hive-site.xml#hive-site.xml</archive>

we get the following error:
{code}
Failing Oozie Launcher, Main class [org.apache.oozie.action.hadoop.SparkMain], main() threw exception, File file:/etc/spark2/conf/hive-site.xml%23hive-site.xml does not exist
{code}
The culprit seems to be https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/sharelib/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/SparkArgsExtractor.java#L480L489 .

Please help me confirm if this is a bug or not. Meanwhile I am creating a fix/workaround to this.
