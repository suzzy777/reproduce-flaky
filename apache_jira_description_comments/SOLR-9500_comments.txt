This patch adds a LogLevel annotation that can be added to any test class or method on a class that extends SolrTestCaseJ4.  Configuration looks like this:

{code}
@LogLevel("org.apache.solr=WARN;org.apache.solr.core.CoreContainer=DEBUG")
{code}

The original log levels for any Loggers changed by this annotation are recorded and then reset once the method or test class has finished executing.

Cool.  Maybe this annotation should be on the ForbiddenApi list so we don't accidentally commit these?

I was thinking that it would sometimes be useful to commit this, for example for a flaky test that won't fail locally - just up the log level on Jenkins for that specific test.

Here's a better patch, isolating all the log4j-specific code to the LogLevel annotation file.
