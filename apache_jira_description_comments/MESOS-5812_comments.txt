Updated snippet of Mac OS part, to reflect log for the first failure.

Fix for one of the issues: https://reviews.apache.org/r/49837

[~anandmazumdar] assigning this to you since you started working on one of the issues (though I can't tell which from your comment).

Yep, I forgot updating this JIRA thereafter.

https://reviews.apache.org/r/49837 : Flaky fix that showed up on ASF.
https://reviews.apache.org/r/49844 : The FD leak that was discovered while fixing the flakiness.

    Fixed a subscriber FD leak when running tests.

    This FD leak would only surface when running tests. We hold on to
    a reference of the \`Connection\` object in the client so that it is
    not destroyed while the connection is active. When running tests,
    the IP:Port of libprocess remain the same which means the objects
    keep on accumulating. In a real world cluster, we remove the
    subscriber upon noticing a \_disconnection\_ i.e. this means the
    socket has already been already closed upstream by Libprocess on
    the server side.

    Fixed the flaky `MasterAPITest.Subscribe` test.

    The test was flaky because `Clock::settle()` does not ensure
    that data in flight (on the wire) is also flushed. Hence, sometimes
    the update used to be sent by the master but never received by the
    library before the test was completed. It would be good if libprocess
    could add some logic for recognizing local HTTP events and sending
    them directly as it does for messages using `send()`.
