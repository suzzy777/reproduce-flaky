The root cause of this flaky test is insufficient timeout value of server socket. The socket timeout is set to 2 second in [setSockOpts | https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/branch-3.4/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumCnxManager.java#L474], and this value is too small to satisfy the build bot (the value sounds also small for a real deployment as well). As a result, in [receiveConnection | https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/branch-3.4/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumCnxManager.java#L249] the read will time out on build bot 90% of times. Increase time out fixed the issue.

Note this test is quite hard to reproduced locally - however it can be deterministically reproduced on our internal (not Apache) build bot. Might related to the latency introduced in virtualized environment.

Submit the patch for fix.

One side note is this flaky test contributes to 80% of the failure of branch-3.4 build on Apache build bots, so get this in can make the trend graph looks much better :)

A sync limit of 2 seems pretty low in general. Shouldn't we fix this for all the tests? Why just this one line? It looks to me like there are a number of QuorumPeer constructors called with this low limit. Also shouldn't we be fixing this on trunk/3.5 as well?

bq. Shouldn't we fix this for all the tests? Why just this one line?
It's because this specific test failed because of the sync limit time with hard proof... the rest of tests (in same QuorumCnxManagerTest suite at least) passed under stress, so they were untouched. Though be proactive seems a good idea for the purpose of consistency and does no harm to slow down the tests (as the sync limit is upper bound, not lower bound), so I'll update the rest of tests in same suite with new sync limit time.

bq. Also shouldn't we be fixing this on trunk/3.5 as well?
For this specific test, no need, because it does not exist in 3.5 :) This test was specifically to test 3.4 upgrade capability for the protocol flag. 
I am not aware of any 3.5 tests that's failing because of such configuration issues, but I will keep this in mind while sweeping rest of the flaky tests.


+1, this looks fine but we need to wait to commit until 3.4.9 is finalized.

Now with 3.4.9 out this one should be ready to go [~phunt]

Committed to 3.4.10. Thanks Michael!

Thanks Pat for reviewing and committing the patch!
