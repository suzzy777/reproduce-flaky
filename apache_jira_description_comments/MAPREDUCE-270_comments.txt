We've seen the lack of out-of-band heartbeat cause severe latency issues for some class of small applications. I'd like to use this jira to re-introduce out-of-band heartbeats when configured for completion of any task. Thoughts?

Straight-forward patches to trunk and yahoop hadoop-0.20 distribution re-introducing the out-of-band heartbeat on task completion (configurable via a secret 'mapreduce.tasktracker.oob.heartbeat' knob).

Re-worked the patch after talking to Devaraj.

+1 core changes look fine.

Completed patch alongwith testcases.

Nigel - This patch proved very very hard to test without mock-objects. For now, I've attached a slightly arbitrary test-case which checks does the following:

# Simulates a very large cluster by setting a very high value of 30s for the heartbeat-interval between the JobTracker and TaskTracker.
# Switches on the out-of-band heartbeat for the cluster.
# Submits a very small random-writer job with 2 maps and asserts that the job completes within 120s. 

The 120s deadline is carefully chosen with the idea that a randomwriter job with 2 maps will need at least 4 heartbeats: setup-task, map_0, map_1 and cleanup-task. However this is still arbitrary and not very scientific. So, should we commit this test-case given that it is slightly flaky? Thoughts?

PS: The job completes in ~50s with out-of-band heartbeats turned on, and in ~3mins with it turned off. FYI

The test failure (TestCopyFiles) is unrelated and is being tracked at MAPREDUCE-1029.

I just committed this.

Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #69 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/69/])
    . Fix the tasktracker to optionally send an out-of-band heartbeat on task-completion for better job-latency. 
Configuration changes:
  add mapreduce.tasktracker.outofband.heartbeat
