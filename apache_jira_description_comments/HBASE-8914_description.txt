TestRegionServerCoprocessorExceptionWithAbort fails sometimes with some cryptic message like: 
{code}
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Check the value configured in 'zookeeper.znode.parent'. There could be a mismatch with the one configured in the master.
{code}

The root cause is that the test thread checks for region server abort in another thread, and interrupts the client. However, if the client (table.put()) is in some path when it gets the interrupt, it does not throw IOE as expected, but IAE. 

This issue will make the test more robust.
