PerfLogger output is useful in understanding perf. There are large gaps in it, however, and it's not clear what is going on during these. Some sections are large and have no breakdown. It would be nice to add more stuff. At this point I'm not certain where exactly, whoever makes the patch (me?) will just need to look at the above gaps and fill them in.
