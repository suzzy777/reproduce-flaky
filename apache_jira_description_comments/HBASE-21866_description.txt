By using the latest HBase master branch, the bug could be re-produced as:
 # create 't1', 'cf1'
 # create 't1', 'cf1'

The following message is logged into HMaster's log:
{code}
INFOÂ  [PEWorker-12] rsgroup.RSGroupAdminServer: Moving table t1 to RSGroup null
{code}
This is a wrong action and instead, we should keep t1 as where it originally is.
