There is a useless nested class in {{TestV1JobsServletBundleEngine}} and {{TestV1JobServletBundleEngine}}:
{noformat}
/**
     * This class is needed in order to reuse some methods of class {@link XDataTestCase}. We cannot directly extend it there as
     * we extend {@link DagServletTestCase}. Anonymous inner class is also not an option since we cannot assign it an annotation.
     * The @Ignore annotation is needed to prevent JUnit from recognizing this inner class as a test.
     */
    @Ignore
    private static class XDataTestCase1 extends XDataTestCase {
    }
{noformat}
The comment is no longer relevant, the classes extend {{DagServletTestCase}} which extends {{XDataTestCase}}, no need for the nested class.

I'm not able to reproduce it, but I find more than suspicious that different tests fail in the precommit unit tests right after the unit test runs (and ignores) the {{XDataTestCase1}} nested class. Maybe the double initialization ofÂ {{XDataTestCase}} causes some problems:
