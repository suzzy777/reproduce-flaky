1.7GB is a huge message, I wonder if this could be a malformed response or some kind of "desynchronized" RPC stream.

After looking at this some more, it appears likely that some other process grabbed the port while we were restarting TestStatus (a regression test for KUDU-2148). That test uses a MiniTabletServer which uses the loopback address instead of UNIQUE_LOOPBACK, which was added to MiniCluster. In order to fix this test flakiness we will need to factor UNIQUE_LOOPBACK functionality out of MiniCluster so that MiniTabletServer can also use it and then change TabletServerTestBase to use it.
