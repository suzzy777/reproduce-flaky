{{GenericTestUtils$LogCapturer}} is useful for assertions against service logs. However it should be fixed in following aspects:
# In the constructor, it uses the stdout appender's layout.
{code}
Layout layout = Logger.getRootLogger().getAppender("stdout").getLayout();
{code}
However, the stdout appender may be named "console" or alike which makes the constructor throw NPE. Actually the layout does not matter and we can use a default pattern layout that only captures application logs.
# {{stopCapturing()}} method is not working. The major reason is that the {{appender}} internal variable is never assigned and thus removing it to stop capturing makes no sense.
# It does not support {{org.slf4j.Logger}} which is preferred to log4j in many modules.
# There is no unit test for it.

This jira is to address these.
