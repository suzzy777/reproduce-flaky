Fixing the class cast issue, i see these are artificially injected errors. They are usually handled? Elsewhere? I see in this flakies run that the ClassCastExceptions are present: https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-2/5370/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.regionserver/TestReplicator/testReplicatorWithErrors/ 

Let me push what I have and leave this open to see if it helps.

Attached patch pushed on branch-2. Leaving issue open to see if this is the fix.

Pre-commit here or on a PR isn't good enough to track the problem? You want to see it pass after repeated builds?

Yeah. Its a rare case. I want it to clear flakies https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-2/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dashboard.html or just stop showing up in my local runs. Day or two? Want something more clean than this?

Pushed to master because TestReplicator dropped off the list of flakies over the weekend.  Resolving (I'd pushed to branch-2 end of last week).
