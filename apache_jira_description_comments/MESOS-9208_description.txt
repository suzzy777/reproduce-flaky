Test {{StorageLocalResourceProviderTest.ROOT_PublishResourcesReboot}} is observed to be flaky on ubuntu-16.04 with a plain build (i.e., no special configuration):
{noformat}
../../src/tests/storage_local_resource_provider_tests.cpp:2393
      Expected: TASK_FINISHED
To be equal to: taskFinished->state()
      Which is: TASK_FAILED{noformat}
However, further investigation shows that the task was failed due to the following error:
{noformat}
executor.cpp:994] Failed to get exit status for Command (pid: 2027){noformat}
Which indicates that the executor couldn't reap the forked child, possibly because it had been mysteriously reaped already.

This doesn't sound like a flakiness specific to this particular test, so I'll leave the test enabled for now.
