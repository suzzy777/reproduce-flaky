It'll be useful to create a Kotlin specific code generator that will product Kotlin code which is based on the existing Java library.

The motivation for a separate Kotlin generator is that:
 * some of the language features in Kotlin can largely simplify generated code in terms of code size and method counts
 * implementing a new Kotlin code gen is easier because it can leverage the existing Java library
