We have a separate wal for meta region. While log splitting logic haven't taken the advantage of this and splitlogworker still picks a wal file randomly. Imaging if we have multiple region servers including meta RS fails about the same time while meta wal is recovered last, all failed regions have to wait meta recovered and then can be online again. 

The open JIRA is to let splitlogworker to pick a meta wal file firstly and then others.
