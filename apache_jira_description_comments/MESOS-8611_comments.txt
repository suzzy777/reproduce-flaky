    Addressed flakiness in the agent tests.

    Directly invoking unmocked calls in tests can lead to concurrent
    access of actor state from multiple execution contexts. It is more
    robust to dispatch the unmocked calls instead.

    Expectations are also added to avoid "uninteresting mock function
    call" test warnings.
