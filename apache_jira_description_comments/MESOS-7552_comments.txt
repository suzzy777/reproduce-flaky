commit 299f6aa0b5b3909cd590c701a12030f52c0852e3 (HEAD -> master, upstream-asf/master)

    Fixed flakiness in MasterAllocatorTest.FrameworkExited.

    This test did not pause the clock; hence, batch allocations could occur
    at unpredictable times and cause the test to fail.

    Fix this by pausing the clock and explicitly advancing it as needed to
    trigger batch allocations or other events.
