{{MiniDFSCluster}} allows the caller to set the number of storage locations per DataNode.  If this number is set higher than 2, and if the cluster is configured with more than 1 DataNode, then the calculation of the storage directory paths will be incorrect.  Multiple DataNodes will attempt to use the same storage directory, and one of them will fail while trying to acquire the file lock.
