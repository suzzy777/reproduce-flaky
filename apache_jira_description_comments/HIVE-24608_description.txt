HIVE-15062 introduced a backward-incompatible change by replacing {{get_table}} with {{get_table_req}}. As consequence, when HMS client w/ version > 2.3 talks to a HMS w/ version < 2.3, it will get error similar to the following:
{code}
AnalysisException: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: Unable to fetch table testpartitiondata. Invalid method name: 'get_table_req';
{code}

Looking at HIVE-15062, the {{get_table_req}} is to introduce client-side check for capabilities. However in branch-2.3 the check is a no-op since there is no capability yet (it is assigned to null). Therefore, this JIRA proposes to switch back to {{get_table}} in branch-2.3 to fix the compatibility issue.
