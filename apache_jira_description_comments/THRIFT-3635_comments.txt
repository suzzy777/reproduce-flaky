    THRIFT-3635 D transport_test is flaky on Jenkins and Travis

    transport_test sometimes fails with LinkeTerminated exception.
    But according to documentation, it should never be thrown at all when using spawn as we do, not spawnLinked.
    Upgrading D to 2.070 seems to have solved the problem on Travis so I'm going to test this on Jenkins precommit with this PR.
