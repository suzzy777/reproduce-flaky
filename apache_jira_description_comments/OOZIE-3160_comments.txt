[~j782070772] what are your exact steps to reproduce?

[~andras.piros]

I set property "oozie.service.CallableQueueService.threads=50" , and start oozie whitout any task， only started oozie。

i use jmx monitor:
 !222222222222222222.png!

linux top commond:
 !11111111111111.png!

 

It's not just {{take()}}, {{put()}} does the same thing:

{noformat}
    @Override
    public void put(QueueElement<E> e) throws InterruptedException {
        while (!offer(e, true)) {
            Thread.sleep(10);
        }
    }
{noformat}

These kinds of constructs should be avoided at all costs. Basically we have two options here:
1) Use a single {{Condition}} object for all priority levels - we already have a {{ReentrantLock}} for the whole queue
2) Use {{Condition}} objects on a per priority basis

#1 is much simpler and already solves this problem, so I'd go for that.



I'm linking OOZIE-1855 as a related JIRA - the tests need significant improvements too.

[~j782070772] if you're still following this ticket, I'd appreciate if you could try out the patch with the same settings.

Anyway, I implemented some big changes inside {{PriorityDelayQueue}}. Unit tests for the class passed on my machine, but we need to see a complete build first.

Note that the tests must be enhanced too - so in the current state it's more like a POC.

OK, this is not going to be as easy as I thought. Actually you can only take out elements after they expired. So a blocking {{take()}} should be woken up properly. 

Looks like we have to do the following if we have to avoid busy waiting:
1. Have a {{ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor}} per priority level
2. We submit tasks in a wrapped {{Callable}} to these executors depending on priority
3. There's a separate thread for each priority where we call {{queue.take()}}. In our case, the queue will be a {{DelayWorkQueue}} which blocks {{take()}} until an item expires.

#3 looks like a limitation, however we only have 3 priority levels in Oozie, so it isn't really a problem.

Since we have to deal with priorities, we need a common {{ExecutorService}} where the queue is not an ordinary blocking queue, but a {{PriorityBlockingQueue}} (this comes with the JDK). This ensures that submitted tasks are ordered based on their priority. So higher priority tasks will run before lower ones. 

Problem is, there is no anti-starvation logic in {{PriorityBlockingQueue}}. To avoid this, we have to track the added elements in a separate data structure. This could be a set of priority queues, which we peek at certain points. If a certain item reached the anti-starvation threshold, we do a promotion inside the main {{PriorityBlockingQueue}} (remove then re-add it with a higher priority).

Whoah, this is a big pain. There must be an easier solution to this... I know I do overcomplicate simple things from time to time. 

[~gezapeti], [~andras.piros], [~rkanter] any thoughts? 

Just talked to the guys here, they suggested that we create a design document about this. The change required here is non-trivial and it's a critical part in Oozie, so if we mess it up, huge problems can occur. So let's be a bit conservative about this ticket.

Thanks for your work on this [~pbacsko]! {{PriorityDelayQueue}} plays an important part of Oozie. So a bit more thinking while working on the design doc is a good approach.

+1 on having a design document.  Not only is this a critical part of Oozie, but we also haven't made any _real_ changes in at least 4 years, and even that was relatively minimal.  Prior to that, it hadn't been touched since Oozie 2.2 back in 2011!
https://github.com/apache/oozie/commits/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/util/PriorityDelayQueue.java



I've started working on the design document. After some preliminary review, I'll share it with the Oozie community.

Thanks for the contribution [~pbacsko]! I like that the code is pretty much aligned with the specification.

I think most functionality is covered and error-free, the code is quite readable - I wouldn't call it a proof of concept anymore ;) I only made a couple of comments on ReviewBoard. Nice job!

[~rohini] [~puru] [~satishsaley] - do you guys have some time to take a look at this patch? It's a pretty substantial change (for this reason, the original code is kept, so users can switch back if they experience any issues). I really should have involved you earlier, sorry for that - but the code is still not on master.

Thanks for the contribution [~pbacsko]!

The last patch 005 looks very promising, a few nits found and left as ReviewBoard comments.

Thanks for the update [~pbacsko]! +1 for patch 006 (pending Jenkins).

Would you please also do some endurance testing, running massive number of coordinator / workflow actions for a few days, on a real cluster? Thanks!

Uploaded patch v7 because accidentally I removed some Findbugs annotations.

[~andras.piros] there's a stability test running on a 4-node cluster. Let's hope it will pass.

{{TestCallableQueueService#testQueueSizeWhenMaxConcurrencyIsReached()}} is flaky, but {{TestCallableQueueService#testPriorityExecutionOrder()}} could not be reproduced either locally or using [{{dist_test}}|http://dist-test.cloudera.org/job?job_id=oozie.forsage.1537522567.2166].

Committing amendment patch 001 to unblock OOZIE-3349.

TODO items still:
# make unit test {{TestHAPartitionDependencyManagerService}} and ZooKeeper related test cases pass when {{oozie.service.CallableQueueService.queue.oldImpl=false}}
# fix {{TestCallableQueueService}} flakiness

[~pbacsko] can you please take some time to fix those outstanding items? Thanks!

{{TestCallableQueueService#testQueueSizeWhenMaxConcurrencyIsReached()}} yeah I understand why it's flaky. It's a bit difficult to write this test to be super-stable.

Basically we want to verify that after submitting 10000 elements, the queue size is close to this number. By the time we retrieve the number, a number of elements have already been removed, depending on how fast the computer is. It's not evident how to choose a good threshold. Looks like >9000 is too high. Maybe something like >5000? 

I can think of a better approach: use barriers or latches in the XCallables and let them run only after we examined the queue size. This would give us a stable result of queue size == 10000.

 

[~pbacsko] I agree, thread pool execution is hard to test.

Using something similar to a {{CountDownLatch}} surely is a better option compared to {{waitFor()}} calls. I'm just wondering whether all {{Callable}} instances will be {{call}}ed in the end.

Amendment patch 003 fixes failing {{ZKXTestCase}} instances, as well as renames the feature switch {{oozie.service.CallableQueueService.queue.oldImpl}} to {{newImpl}}.

It also introduces a check in {{CallableQueueService#queue()}} to check queue shut down or terminated state in case of {{newImpl}}.

The root cause of the prolonged JUnit test runs was that it was harder to shut down two {{ThreadPoolExecutor}} instances within {{AsyncXCommandExecutor}} for {{newImpl}} than one {{ThreadPoolExecutor}} for {{oldImpl}}. Made the timeout value between {{ExecutorService#awaitTermination()}} and {{ExecutorService#shutdown()}} configurable, default being 30 seconds - that is changed for 1 second meanwhile testing in {{XTestCase#setUp()}}.
