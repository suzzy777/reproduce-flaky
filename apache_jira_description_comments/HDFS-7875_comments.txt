Weird. I can't get to those builds to force a re-run.  So cancel/submit here we go...

That said, spacing is weird here:

{code}
+              + ".Value configured is either 0 or >= to the configured volumes. ");
{code}

Thanks for having a look in this change
Updated the patch with format change. Hope it will be ok

Let's put a space in between the . and Value.  There is also extraneous space at the end of that line.

Updated for the comments.
sorry for the simple mistake :)

Build failure looks like not related to patch

*cp: cannot stat '/home/jenkins/buildSupport/lib/*': No such file or directory*
Checking patch hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/datanode/fsdataset/impl/FsDatasetImpl.java...

The new error looks better, but do you feel its possible to also print the # of currently configured volumes, to add further context into the error?

Also two nits:

1. "configurd" -> "configured"
2. "Value configured is either 0" -> "Value configured is either less than 0" (0 is a valid value)

thanks Harsh for the comments

Thanks! Change looks good to me, +1. At first glance, the TestDatanodeManager failure appears unrelated, but re-running it locally to be certain anyhow. Will commit after that.

The TestTracing failure appears to be something broken in trunk instead and can be ignored here.

Test seems flaky, as it passed without and with the patch locally. Going ahead with the commit.

Committed to branch-2 and trunk. Many thanks again for the improvement!
