[~guoquan] will you be interested in taking a stab here? This is a unit test failure which is happening quite often, causing precommit false positives.

[~bdmogal], seems it is related to SENTRY-1119. Do you have idea of what's going on?

[~vamsee] Can you take a look at this? It is failing fairly often at least in sentry-ha-redesign branch.

Do we know when was the last time we saw this failing? I tried running this particular test on my local machine and was not able to reproduce even with 50 continuous iterations.

I wrote a small script that executes the above test over and over checking for failure.
{code}
MacBook-Pro:sentry-provider-db vamsee$ cat runTest.sh 
#!/bin/bash -x
count=1
while [[ `mvn clean test -Dtest=TestPrivilegeOperatePersistence#testGrantPrivilegeExternalComponentInvalidConf` ]]; do
  echo "Re-Running test -- COUNT: $count"
  count=`expr $count + 1`
done  
{code}

 I have checked the test results of past available builds (build 2913-2918, for example https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-SENTRY-Build/2918/console), and theTestPrivilegeOperatePersistence.testGrantPrivilegeExternalComponentInvalidConf did not fail at all. It seems this issue does not exist anymore.

Build [https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-SENTRY-Build/3679/] has the same failure. So this test still fails when running remotely, but does not fail locally.
