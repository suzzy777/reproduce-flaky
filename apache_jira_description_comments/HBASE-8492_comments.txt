Patch for 0.94

TestAccessController#testBulkLoad fails

TestAccessController is already a fat test. Do this new test case as a new unit test? Maybe we should break out the cases related to that Endpoint also?

We have two options:
1. parameterize TestAccessController so that there is one and two masters, respectively
2. introduce master failover into a new test

Looks like #2 is better.


Looking at TestAccessController in trunk, permission granting is done in setUp() method. This is different from the setup in 0.94 branch.
I wonder if permission granting can be lifted to setupBeforeClass(). This way, stopping the active master and letting standby master take over would happen only once instead of for every test.

if you fix the tests that change the permissions you can move back the granting to setupBeforeClass().
Take a look at HBASE-8122, some tests revoke rights from the ones setup in the beginning

In testGrantRevoke(), READ permission was taken away from USER_RO for TEST_TABLE :
{code}
          ProtobufUtil.revoke(protocol, USER_RO.getShortName(), TEST_TABLE,
            TEST_FAMILY, null, Action.READ);
{code}
But the verification seems to be at the global level:
{code}
    verifyAllowed(revokeAction, SUPERUSER, USER_ADMIN, USER_OWNER);
    verifyDenied(revokeAction, USER_CREATE, USER_RW, USER_RO, USER_NONE);
{code}
Should verification on the TEST_TABLE be added ?

We should be hesitant to change a unit test that has a lot of cases and has had flaky test fixes in the past. Why start mucking around and destabilize it again?

bq. This way, stopping the active master and letting standby master take over would happen only once instead of for every test.

-1, this is why I suggest a separate unit test. Leave TestAccessController alone.

Changed the JIRA description. Feel free to change back if there is disagreement.

@Andy:
I agree with creating new test for the master failover scenario.

No viable patch as of yet, unscheduling.
