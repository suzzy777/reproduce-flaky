If we want to see whether we have made a compaction and what kind of compaction we have done for this node, we may go to see the compaction_history system table for some deftails or use nodetool compactionhistory command , But I found that the table do not specify the compaction type so does the compactionhistory command too, like index build , compaction type, clean or scrub for this node. So I think may be it is need to add a type of compaction column to specify the compaction tpe for system.compaction_history and so we can get the type of compaction through system.compaction_history table or nodetool compactionhistory to see whether we have made a major compact for this node  .:)
