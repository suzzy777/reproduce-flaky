hey [~dantongdong]!

This sounds like an interesting thing - I wanted to do something similar but never got time for it.
Right now we are running many of these CliDriver tests - which gives us some level of coverage - but we don't really have much smoke tests;
which do excercise the normal usage flow and not work thru the hacks of QTestUtil and similar things.

In the new test system I've already tried to prepare things for that - and I've configured it to run the schema initialization in a few databases.
We could change the way it works - but it would be very valuable to have tests which are not relying on itests or on the HIVE_IN_TEST and alike confs

let me know what you think!

There is another option of using embedded rdbms [https://github.com/zonkyio/embedded-postgres,|https://github.com/zonkyio/embedded-postgres] [https://github.com/vorburger/MariaDB4j]. I'm not sure if these are available for mssql or oracle. But it can certainly be done with postgres, mariadb and derby. 

Fix has been merged to master. Closing the jira.

The ticket is marked as resolved for 4.0.0 but we are currently underway of releasing 4.0.0-alpha-2 so I changed the fixVersion accordingly; If that is not accurate please update the fixVersion accordingly.
