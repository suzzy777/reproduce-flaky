The logic during vectorized execution that keeps track of how deep we are in the nested structure doesn't work for ARRAYs and STRUCTs embedded inside maps.

Repro steps (with hive.vectorized.execution.enabled=true):
{code}
CREATE TABLE srctable(a map<int,array<int>>) STORED AS TEXTFILE;
create table desttable(c1 map<int,array<int>>);
insert into srctable values (map(1, array(1, 2, 3)));
insert into desttable select a from srctable;
select * from desttable;
{code}
Will produce:
{code}
{1:[null]}
{code}
