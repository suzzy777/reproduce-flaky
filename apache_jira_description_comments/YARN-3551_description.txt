Based on the comments on [YARN-3134|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3134?focusedCommentId=14512080&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14512080] and [YARN-3411|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3411?focusedCommentId=14512098&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14512098], we need to change the data model to restrict the data type of info/config/metric section.

1. Info: the value could be all kinds object that is able to be serialized/deserialized by jackson.

2. Config: the value will always be assumed as String.

3. Metric: single data or time series value have to be number for aggregation.

Other than that, info/start time/finish time of metric seem not to be necessary for storage. They should be removed.
