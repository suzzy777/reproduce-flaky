I believe I got [~adelapena] approval in slack, so starting merge; will hold off on the push up until I confirm

Looks good to me, I have just added a comment about how we log the updating of properties, it can be addressed on commit.

thanks!  Pushed to the source branch linked above, and watching CI

CI Results:

j8_unit:
* org.apache.cassandra.db.commitlog.CommitLogSegmentManagerCDCTest and org.apache.cassandra.dht.tokenallocator.OfflineTokenAllocatorTest both timeout in the JVM and didn't show up in test results... 

j11_jvm_dtest: org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.PaxosRepairTest#paxosRepairVersionGate first time failing according to butler and we ran this test 4 times (j8/j11 w/ and w/o vnode) and only once did it fail, so feels flaky https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra/1381/workflows/4a4e6100-6582-43fd-8f39-6b3cbb5a94b6/jobs/11282/tests#failed-test-0 .  Creating a ticket for this

python upgrade looks to be failing to CASSANDRA-17451 and a CQL parser issue... need to look into this as [~brandon.williams] was saying that the timeout is 17451 but the CQL parser issue is new... so holding off the merge

found out the issue for the python upgrade test failures, CASSANDRA-10537 made a change to both python-dtest and trunk, and when this CI run was kicked off that patch wasn't in trunk, but it picked up the python-dtest changed, which caused this error

Rebased again and trying 1 more time

jvm upgrade test failed due to CASSANDRA-16238 (race condition with fat client removal) which got fixed later on
