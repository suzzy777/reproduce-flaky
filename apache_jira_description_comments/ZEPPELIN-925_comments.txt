    @bzz What you have seen is different from the first error. Have you ever seen the first one before? I'll make a new issue for second error with `flaky-test` tag.
    
    And it's good to remain documentation about hive until - may be - 0.7.0 to guide that users use a JDBC interpreter to use hive. I'll update hive.md again.

    @jongyoul changes looks good to me. About the documentation I think same as @bzz for the users who were already using hive interpreter. I think it would be good to keep hive.md document and mention that hive interpreter is merged into master and refer the jdbc interpreter doc link.

    Hi @jongyoul, great job with all integrations in the jdbc interpreter.
    What do you think, about putting hive dependence into the pom and so it is not necessary add the jar in the classpath.


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/943
  
    @vgmartinez Now, Zeppelin enable load dependencies dynamically, thus if you set dependencies in your interpreter tab, it works. Thus, we don't have to include any dependencies any more. See an example below:
    
    <img width="1054" alt="screen shot 2016-06-08 at 3 00 54 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3612566/15886295/30e21efe-2d97-11e6-9842-8d269d7bd867.png">



Github user vgmartinez commented on the issue:

    @jongyoul ok ok, all external dependencies loaded them that way. I have been a time out...;)
