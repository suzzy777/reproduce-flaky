In branch-3.3 and upper, unit tests failures are ignored in HADOOP-16596. That way we can run all the unit tests in all the modules by simply modifying a file under the project root directory. Without the feature, if there is a test failure in a module (it is likely happen due to the flaky jobs), the tests in the subsequent modules are not executed. I want to introduce the feature in the other branches.
