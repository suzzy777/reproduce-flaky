[~timrobertson100] can you take care of them? I fixed the last flakes, but now I don't have time

Please note for point 2 that we have the ability now to set the timeout at the Elasticsearch client level .

For point one, jenkins might be overloader and ES embedded cluster became unhealthy. As a defensive action I would recommend configuring the embedded cluster for IO v5 and IO v6 to fewer nodes. No need for IO v2, because there is no cluster because I could use embedded node that was removed by the ES team in favor ES test framework that provides an embedded cluster

How is this going now? If you aren't actively working on it, perhaps release it for someone else to see about deflaking.

Hi Kenn, [~timrobertson100] is in holidays AFAIK.  I'll take care of this ticket.

done, PR submitted

[~kenn] as you're cutting the release branch, should I target the fix to 2.10 and cherry pick commits to 2.10 release branch ? Maybe for a simple flakiness fix it's not worth it, WDYT ?

[~echauchot] if it is a fix just in the test, then it is fine to just set fix version to Not Applicable as it does not need to be tracked in release notes or anything.

I just was following my own suggestion of making sure flakes have a Fix Version when they are open to make sure they get looked at before release - to make sure the flake label is not hiding an important issue that could block a release.

ok I understand, I'll close it and target "not applicable" version.

closing, we would reopen it if other errors come up. I no more wait a week for flakiness fixes to avoid forgetting a ticket.
