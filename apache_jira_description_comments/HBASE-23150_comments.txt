Let me check on this [~psomogyi], since I had added this test in HBASE-22380.

Failures seem to be introduced by commit fec4c5249968e112b5ab6f4154d0e6c1fe428abc, from HBASE-23136. Let me revert that commit.

Reverted it. Will post an amending PR on HBASE-23136 later.

Came along to figure out why Wellington's initial patch was reverted :)

I see things are passing again in https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/job/master/4509/. Resolving this.
