IMPALA-10957: test_iceberg_query is flaky

In iceberg-query.test we create an external Iceberg table and
set the table property 'iceberg.file_format' to check
backward-compatibility with earlier versions. At the end we
delete the table. The table deletion makes the test fail
sporadically during GVO.

Seems like the bug is caused by the parallel execution of this test.
The test didn't use a unique database, therefore dropping the table
could affect other executions of the same test. This patch puts
the relevant queries to their own .test file using a unique
database.
