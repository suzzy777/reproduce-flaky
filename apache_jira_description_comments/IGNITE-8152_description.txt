Currently we allow empty schema name (quoted) in cache configuration
org.apache.ignite.configuration.CacheConfiguration#setSqlSchema :
{noformat}
When sqlSchema is not specified, quoted cacheName is used instead.

sqlSchema could not be an empty string. Has to be "\"\"" instead.

Params:
sqlSchema - Schema name for current cache according to SQL ANSI-99. Should not be null.
{noformat}

Specifying schema \"\" results in empty string schema name.
No schema in sql query is treated as PUBLIC, but \"\" is regular schema name.

It's better to disallow usage of \"\" schema
