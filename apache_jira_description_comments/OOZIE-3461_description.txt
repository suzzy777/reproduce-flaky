It seems to me don't really use the {{delayedCallables}} and {{delay}} variables in {{CoordMaterializeTriggerService.CoordMaterializeTriggerRunnable}} class. We only add items to {{callables}} and not to {{delayedCallables}}. We could remove this part of the class.

It should be also useful to log the lock acquiring and not only the releasing ( like in [PauseTransitService|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/service/PauseTransitService.java#L86] )
