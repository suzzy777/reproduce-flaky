So seeing a problem in 3.11.0 where SSTables are being lost from the view and not being included in compactions/as candidates for compaction. It seems to get progressively worse until there's only 1-2 SSTables in the view which happen to be the most recent SSTables and thus compactions completely stop for that table.

The SSTables seem to still be included in reads, just not compactions.

The issue can be fixed by restarting C*, as it will reload all SSTables into the view, but this is only a temporary fix. User defined/major compactions still work - not clear if they include the result back in the view but is not a good work around.

This also results in a discrepancy between SSTable count and SSTables in levels for any table using LCS.

Also for STCS we've confirmed that SSTable count will be different to the number of SSTables reported in the Compaction Bucket's. In the below example there's only 3 SSTables in a single bucket - no more are listed for this table. Compaction thresholds haven't been modified for this table and it's a very basic KV schema.

Also for every LCS table we're seeing the following warning being spammed (seems to be in line with anticompaction spam):

Apr 26 21:30:09 cassandra[9263]: WARNÂ  o.a.c.d.c.LeveledCompactionStrategy Live sstable /var/lib/cassandra/data/xxx/xxx-8c3ef9e0e3fc11e6868a8fd39a64fd59/mc-79024-big-Data.db from level 0 is not on corresponding level in the leveled manifest. This is not a problem per se, but may indicate an orphaned sstable due to a failed compaction not cleaned up properly.{code}
This is a vnodes cluster with 256 tokens per node, and the only thing that seems like it could be causing issues is anticompactions.

CASSANDRA-14079 might be related but doesn't quite describe the same issue, and in this case we're using only a single disk for data. Have yet to reproduce but figured worth reporting here first.
