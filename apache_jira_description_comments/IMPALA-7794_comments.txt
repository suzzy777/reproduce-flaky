IMPALA-7794: Rewrite flaky ownership authorization tests

This patch rewrites the ownership authorization tests to not depend on
delay and timeout, which can help to avoid the flakiness. The patch also
refactors some tests to reuse Sentry and Impala instances without having
to restart them, which can speed up the tests. To keep the same test
coverage, no tests were removed.

Testing:
- Ran all authorization E2E tests multiple times.
