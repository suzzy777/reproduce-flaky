[~sergey-chugunov], review these changes, please.

[~xtern],

Change looks good to me, it makes the test more stable and eliminates the root cause of some flaky failures its previous implementation suffered from.

In a nutshell, prev impl relied on threads interruption when exiting the test but some threads may be sitting in stopGrid method at the moment of interruption. Our test framework treat interruption inside this method as an error during the test and fails it.

So as it is fixed in new implementation and we have an approval from the bot, we could proceed with merging.

[~dpavlov], could you please take a look?

Thanks, [~xtern], merged your changes to master.
