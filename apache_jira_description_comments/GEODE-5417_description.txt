All of these tests with the UITest category seem to be flaky, with the exception of those that extend BaseServiceTest. I've attached the results of the metrics job against the current concourse pipeline with 144 runs.

We should fix the systematic failures in these tests, or replace/remove them if we have coverage elsewhere.
