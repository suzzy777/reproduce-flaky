The existing regression tests (HIVE-12586) based on TPC-DS have certain shortcomings:

The table statistics do not reflect cardinalities from a specific TPC-DS scale factor (SF). Some tables are from a 30TB dataset, others from 200GB dataset, and others from a 3GB dataset. This mix leads to plans that may never appear when using an actual TPC-DS dataset. 

The existing statistics do not contain information about partitions something that can have a big impact on the resulting plans.

The existing regression tests rely on more or less on the default configuration (hive-site.xml). In real-life scenarios though some of the configurations differ and may impact the choices of the optimizer.

This issue aims to address the above shortcomings by using a curated TPCDS30TB metastore dump along with some custom hive configurations.
