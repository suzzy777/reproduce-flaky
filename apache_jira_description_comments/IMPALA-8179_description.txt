    uint32_t seed = time(NULL);
    cout << "seed = " << seed << endl;
    srand(seed);

There is no way to force the seed, and backend tests using {{rand()}} are then flaky by default. We should make them unflaky by default (using a specific random seed) and we should also provide a way to override this by setting it by time or to a specific seed for just one run, to help with debugging.

If we want the coverage that comes from running with a different seed each time, we could run a test multiple times.
