We have multiple Oozie scheduled clusters. The problem that is currently encountered is that some materialize queues are too late to process during the peak hours of the scheduled tasks. We need to get the metrics of the delay queue for alarm monitoring and adjust the configuration to optimize.
Currently we have added metrics for queue size and latency in Oozie CoordMaterializeTriggerService class, in order to reflect the general trend of current scheduling.
