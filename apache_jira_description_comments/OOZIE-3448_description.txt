There is a section in [oozie-server/pom.xml|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/branch-5.1/server/pom.xml#L180-L262] which is responsible for the copying of the artifacts/dependencies.

We use [dependency:copy-dependencies|https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/examples/copying-project-dependencies.html] which copies the dependencies, but still list the artifacts (which is valid for [dependency:copy|https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/examples/copying-artifacts.html]).

I think maven copies the dependencies and ignores the listed artifacts. If this is true, we can remove the {{artifactItems}}. IfÂ my assumption is not true, then we should use {{dependency:copy}} instead of {{dependency:cop-dependencies}}.
