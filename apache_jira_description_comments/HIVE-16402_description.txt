Hadoop 2.8.0 has been out since March, we should upgrade to it. Release notes for Hadoop 2.8.x are here: http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.8.0/index.html

It has a number of useful features, improvements for S3 support, ADLS support, etc. along with a bunch of other fixes. This should also help us on our way to upgrading to Hadoop 3.x (HIVE-15016).
