The test is flaky because of an actual bug in the code which was introduced in MESOS-2864. I'll re-open it add details of the bug there.

The bug affects this test because the master and slave views of the task become inconsistent which results in an extra status update (TASK_LOST) during reconciliation between master and slave after slave restart.

Fixed as part of the fix for MESOS-2864.
