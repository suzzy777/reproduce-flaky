This appears to be flaky, it passed in the last run.

After investigating, I believe it to be a bug in the Kudu error reporting which makes us believe there is 1 less error than there should be. I filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1743 and will think about what we can do to unblock tests in the meantime.

Is IMPALA-3710 the culprit? Shall we xfail the test, or revert the patch? (xfailing sounds better, because this isn't a product bug in Impala that we know of).

I think the issue would have been there for a number of weeks, it seems to be an uncommon race in the Kudu client. I've been working with Kudu on it but I don't have a fix yet. Has this come up anywhere else? I suspect it's pretty uncommon because I think this would have been possible to hit since Oct 19th when I added the additional validation. If you're OK with this, I'd prefer to wait a few days to see if we can get a real fix / workaround from Kudu. I'd rather not lose the coverage of these tests entirely since it's pretty important coverage right now while the Kudu paths are churning. If we don't think we can get a satisfying fix/workaround by Friday, or we continue to see this fail, then I'll submit a patch to skip validating these tests.

should be resolved by the kudu fix which is now in the Impala build:
