With the kerberos authentication enabled, failed to load Oozie console due to the authentication failure of the javascript resource under {{/ext-2.2}}. Go back the Oozie log, the following error messages found:

Based on the analysis, the issue should related to is related to the jira [*HADOOP-8830*|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8830]: {{org.apache.hadoop.security.authentication.server.AuthenticationFilter}} might be called twice, causing kerberos replay errors.

# Current oozie leverages Hadoop for the authentication.
# Based on the resouce difference, it defines the filter for the  authentication, but for some resources such as some js under ext-2.2, they are always authenticated twice, the reason is beacuse oozie has the following filter definition:
{code:xml}
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>authenticationfilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>*.js</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>authenticationfilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/ext-2.2/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
{code}
With the issue in HADOOP-8830, the final authentication is failure, so we finally get the error 403 in browser(which directly causes the console disabled).
# For 2),  it just hit the issue in Jira HADOOP-8830, if the oozie's debug mode is enabled, logs clearly show that.
