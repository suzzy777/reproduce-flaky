This sounds very interesting as we are discussing about the introduction of new metrics system.

We could start from this work and maybe abstract the way metrics are published, in order to support various metrics providers like Prometheus

I have taken a look to the patch.

We can take this as a base but I would prefer not to have all the counters retained by the values of an enum.
We should have some central non-static registry  of all metrics.
Think will be the center of the work on ZOOKEEPER-3092.

The patch does not add tests, it would be good to test at least that new metrics are reported by the monitor command.

[~eolivelli] My thought is we still need a metric interface to hook with external reporters - and also we need metrics type definition more than counter which is the only type presented in the patch. ZOOKEEPER-3092 is more about the general metrics framework infrastructure and the work in this Jira is more about actual instrumentation and metrics collection.
