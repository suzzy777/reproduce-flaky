The current jackson-core dependency in Solr is not compatible with Amazon AWS S3 dependency. AWS S3 requires jackson-core-2.6.6 while Solr uses jackson-core-dependency-2.5.4. This is blocking the usage of latest updates from S3.

It would be greatly helpful if someone could revise the jackson-core jar in Solr to the latest version. This is a ShowStopper for our Public company.

Details of my Setup:
Solr Version: 6.3
AWS SDK version: 1.11.76
