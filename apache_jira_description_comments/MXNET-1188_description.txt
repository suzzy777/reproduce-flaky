Build and implement the multi-environment testing for the CI as part of the publish pipeline. It should pull a dependency bundled jar (either from the build stage if available or nexus) and run it across various environments. Those environments must also include docker containers that install only the basic dependencies needed

The following environments are currently planned:
 * 14.04
 * 16.04
 * 18.04
 * centOS
 * amazon linux
