Thinking on approach, primarily we can decide to publish into both timeline server using configuration. Currently we have *yarn.timeline-service.version* which creates corresponding TimelineClients. How about using same configuration with comma separated values to start both clients from RM i.e *yarn.timeline-service.version=1.5,2.0*?
Let's say, before upgrade RM is running with 1.5 which starts only V1 timeline client. After upgrade based on the configuration, RM starts both V1 and V2  clients as long as admin explicitly change timeline version to 2. 

Point to be discussed are
# should we expose new configuration rather than using modifying existing configuration? Something like *yarn.timeline-service.upgrade-mode=true*. When this set to true, nevertheless of timeline version, RM will start and publishing to both v1 and v2. 
# When to stop publishing to v1? Does admin decides it? If so, should we provide a REST interface to disable runtime or need to restart RM by changing upgrade-mode configuration to false?


Final switch to v2 only would involve some kind of admin operation. We would have to switch off timeline server v1 for instance.
If AHS/ATSv1 server is running, for instance even though we have decided to switch to v2, client running the job may misconfigure v1 all across, get timeline delegation token from the server and the job would publish entities to timeline v1 while RM/NM would publish to v2. 
So, admin would need to shutdown ATSv1 server so that misconfiguration is caught at the time of job submission itself.



Is this a merge blocker?

Is this a dupe of YARN-4368?

We would like to run both services in parallel for a time.  Rather than having an "upgrade" mode, I think it would be cleaner to specify the versions in a list as mentioned.  I was working on a similar solution to create a publisher class that basically took a collection of timeline services to publish to based on the versions specified.  

I made a similar change locally and an issue I had was getting my single node setup running with both services.  ATS v1 and v2 wanted to use the same port.  I ended up creating a new conf port setting for v2 that defaults back to the v1 port if not found.



Thanks [~agresch] for your comments! On behalf of YARN community, I welcome you to YARN project and appreciate your interest on contribution.

bq. Is this a dupe of YARN-4368?
Probably Yes! 
bq. I think it would be cleaner to specify the versions in a list as mentioned.
make sense to me as well! Primary reason to add upgrade config is this required during upgrades only. If a user starting freshly, directly he can make use of V2. V2 support all V1 use case as well as well many more things wrt scalability and other. Life long running both servers, I do not think it is really optimal deployment strategy.

I wasn't known that you also working on this JIRA. Probably what you could do is, comment on the JIRA so that others won't take it up. Would you like to work on this JIRA? Feel free to take it up, I can help you in reviewing and committing patch.

Yeah, this is problem in cluster manager such as Ambari. This need to be fixed. We use same config for both V1 and V2 reader daemon. 


Infact, clash of v1 and v2 configurations would be a problem for our internal cluster manager as well. But we can possibly handle this internally.
The intention initially was to reuse as much of v1 configurations as possible instead of introducing new ones as we would eventually replace v1.

[~rohithsharma] I just started looking into this issue recently and stumbled onto this JIRA after I had started.  I will work on it, thank you.

Should this still be based off the YARN-5355 branch?

We are thinking of considering this for the next TSv2 release. We will start looking at the patches soon, we will also think about "migration steps"  cc [~rohithsharma] [~varun_saxena]

The patch approach looks good to me!  It also maintaining compatibility which is good. I attached the rebased patch to run jenkins. 

[~varun_saxena] [~vrushalic] do you have any comments on the patch?

Thanks [~agresch] and [~rohithsharma]. This makes sense to have it can where we want to have upgrade seamlessly  from ATS1.5 to 2 to avoid data loss.

committed to trunk/branch-3/branch-2/yarn-7055. thanks Aaron for the patch! I will raise separate JIRA to update doc for corresponding changes

Thanks [~agresch] for the patch and [~rohithsharma] for the reviews and commit! 

I had a few basic questions.

 - in ApplicationMaster # init, the patch removes the setting of timelineServiceV1Enabled 

at line 638 but uses it at line 709. Since it is not set, this will not invoke publishApplicationAttemptEvent I think? 

Similarly for timelineServiceV2Enabled at lines 701. 

- The  Float f = Float.parseFloat(s); is  likely to throw a number format exception in case of some misconfiguration in the config values. Perhaps a good idea to catch this and ignore and proceed. 

- Not very important but I didn’t get why the conf settings for timeline server address & port had to be moved out of synchronized  in MiniYARNCluster were in this patch?

Thanks [~vrushalic] for post review.. Since there were no reply from anyone I went ahead with committing this patch. We can created follow up JIRA if any issues has been observed from this patch.

Before publishing, *startTimelineClient(conf);* is being called which initializes these variables at line no. 700 which is not present in this patch. You can see startTimelineClient(conf) method change in patch.

IIUC, if wrong configuration value has been set then we need to inform admin immediately. So I thought let it throw exception and fail the service start up.

Configuration is global settings which same config is being passed to ApplicationHistoryServerWrapper service. Doing this, all the services gets same values. I believe this should not cause any impact. Btw, I guess it changed because of test failure after this patch change which I see from history of patches.
