Following the problem of flakiness that occurred in the project
{code:java}
nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-asn1-bundle/nifi-asn1-services{code}
test file
{code:java}
org.apache.nifi.jasn1.TestJASN1RecordReaderWithComplexTypes{code}

with below three tests


{code:java}
testBasicTypes
testRecursive
testInheritance{code}


All three above tests use the same file, `JASN1ReadRecordTester` as the tester.
The test flakiness is due to comparisons between two ArrayList outputs from Class
`SimpleRecordSchema` which use ArrayList to store one of the parameter `List<RecordField>`

However, ArrayList does not guarantee entry orders, its object is an unordered set of name/value pairs, and internal permutations may occur in the output as a String.

 

*Steps to reproduce the failure:*
The flakiness was found with [NonDex.|https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex)]
After installing NonDex and run the following code.
{code:java}
cd nifi
mvn install -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-asn1-bundle/nifi-asn1-services -am -DskipTests
mvn -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-asn1-bundle/nifi-asn1-services edu.illinois:nondex- 
  maven-plugin:1.1.3-SNAPSHOT:nondex -
