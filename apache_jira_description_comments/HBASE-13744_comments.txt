Bisecting to find the offending commit.

HBASE-13651 introduces TestCorruptedRegionStoreFile, which has been flaky since commit to 0.98. I am going to open a subtask to temporarily disable the test and commit it. This is an important fix.

We should fix the test. 

Prevent compaction from interfering with the test.  Patch for 0.98. 

I'd make this change everywhere..

Tests didn't complete... some killing going on. These tests look obnoxious. Let me take a look at them.

+1 on commit all around.

We can remove TestVisibilityLabelsWithDistributedLogReplay. It is testing a feature we no longer support. It is removed in master as part of HBASE-12751. Let me remove it as far back as 0.98.

bq. We can remove TestVisibilityLabelsWithDistributedLogReplay. It is testing a feature we no longer support. It is removed in master as part of HBASE-12751. Let me remove it as far back as 0.98.

+1 to that
