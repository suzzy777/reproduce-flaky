I'm currently debugging locally why do integration tests fail for [https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2679]

One of the problems in my setup was that I use Firefox 59, and Selenium simply hangs with it. At the same time, Chrome and Safari work fine. According to [https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2017/08/09/firefox-55-and-selenium-ide] , Firefox versions 55+ do not work with Selenium, so I would propose to skip them when creating the WebDriver.
