Hey [~mgrigorov] 

Could you please upload here the patch file? OOZIE-3645-001.patch . 
Pull requests do now work now, validation does not start for them. :( 

 

Thanks,

Denes

Done!

I didn't attach a patch because it is a simple change in the documentation part. No functional changes.

PreCommit-OOZIE-Build started


Thank you. I know there is no functional change but doc is generated during the build. Just be sure everything works.
