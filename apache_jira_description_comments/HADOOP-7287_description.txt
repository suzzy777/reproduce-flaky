For example, you can't use -D options on the "hadoop fs" command line in order to specify the deprecated names of configuration options. The issue is that the ordering is:
- JVM starts
- GenericOptionsParser creates a Configuration object and calls set() for each of the options specified on command line
- DistributedFileSystem or other class eventually instantiates HdfsConfiguration which adds the deprecations
- Some class calls conf.get("new key") and sees the default instead of the version set on the command line
