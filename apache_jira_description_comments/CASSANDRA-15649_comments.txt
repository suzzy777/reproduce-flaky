LGTM.

Quick question on why the uninstall of cqlsh is happening in this patch?
(And I can't access the CircleCI links…?)

sorry, talked to [~djoshi] about that.  looks like when python3 was added LOWER and HIGHER were updated, but config.yml was not replaced with config.yml.LOWER (undocumented, something you have to do though).

Since I changed the build, I had to update config.yml to pick that up (cp config.yml.LOWER config.yml)

bq. (And I can't access the CircleCI links…?)

-_-  that isn't good... ill try to figure out why Monday.

[~dcapwell], could you provide the 2.2, 3.0, and 3.11 patches please. (as the trunk patch does not cleanly apply.)

[~mck] sent for all 4. 

in case the CI runs are not visible (reached out to circle ci team about this), all LOWERs passed and confirmed the change took affect (2.2 had a test failure, I don't monitor 2.2 so not familiar with its flaky tests, but I did see the change was picked up).

Thanks. (The circleci links are still not visible)

since Circle CI is locking down workflows for some reason, ill take a screen shot of the DAG + the params and attach to JIRA.  There are test failures, for trunk I linked to the flaky test JIRA, for other builds I don't have history so don't know what's flaky.

the 2.2 builds spam stdout so the UI doesn't show the ant command, so print out the script.
