Although we cannot see that in regular CI, this test is flaky and I can see that in our private test runs. The problem is that it assumes two consecutive queries are executed in the exact same second. A similar test case {{testPartitionDeletionRowDeletionTie}} has been already fixed in CASSANDRA-16443. We need almost identical fix for this one as well.
