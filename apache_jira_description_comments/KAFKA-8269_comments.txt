Since this is not a blocker issue, as part of the 2.6.0 release process I'm changing the fix version to `2.6.1` and `2.7.0`. If this is incorrect, please respond and discuss on the "[DISCUSS] Apache Kafka 2.6.0 release" discussion mailing list thread.

Since this is not a blocker, and a related ticket with the same failure is marked as resolved, I'm closing this as resolved as part of the 2.7.0 release process.
