This feature is needed to remove flakiness from AsyncEventQueue and Wan tests without using thread sleeps.

Tests such as AsyncEventListenerDistributedTest need to pause the GatewaySender and then do some work after every dispatcher thread has successfully paused. These tests currently sleep for one second after pausing the GatewaySender. In order to convert the thread sleep to an Awaitility call, we need an isPaused() method added to GatewaySender or we need to change pause() to be synchronous.
