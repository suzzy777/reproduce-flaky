The {{help}} command of the oozie CLI prints out usage information. It is also possible to print out only for the specified command, for instance:
{noformat}
oozie help job{noformat}
This information is also available in the [Markdown|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/docs/src/site/markdown/DG_CommandLineTool.md] documentation and in the generated HTML.

There are several differences, the Markdown (HTML) looks outdated. For instance for {{job}} command lists the fluent job options as {{apijarcheck}}, {{apijarsubmit}}, and {{apijarrun}} but these options has been renamed to {{validatejar}}, {{submitjar}}, and {{runjar}}. The CLI help shows the correct names. Note that Fluent Job related differences are handled by OOZIE-3358.
