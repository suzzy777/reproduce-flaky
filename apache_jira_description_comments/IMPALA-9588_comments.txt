[~gaborkaszab] could you maybe take a quick look at this. I don't think we have enough logs to root cause this, but the logging in the test seems inadequate. AFAICT the thread running __fetch_results hit an error, but that error is not logged anywhere by the tests.

I think we probably just need more logging to understand what happened.

IMPALA-9588: Add extra logging to cancel tests

There have been some cancel tests that are flaky and their logs didn't
reveal the root cause of the failures. Adding some extra logging so
that we can see a bit more of the nature of the failure.
The extra log message contains:
  - Query SQL
  - Message of the exception thrown during fetching the results
  - Query Status line from the query profile
