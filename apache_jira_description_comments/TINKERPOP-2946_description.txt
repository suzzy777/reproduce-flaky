Gremlin doesn't enforce order, yet many of the gherkin tests carry that expectation. 

1. Develop a mechanism to ensure that tests don't come with that expectation.
2. Fix tests that have this assumption and improve test language and assertion logic as needed.

One way to do (1) would be to provide a configuration to TinkerGraph that would make it behave more like most graph databases and purposefully randomize result streams. Perhaps this configuration could be used as part of a integration test to ensure a regular {{mvn clean install}} works deterministically?? Doing (1) should yield information on what needs to be done with (2). Some of (2) may be test fixes, but I think assertion logic around containers may need to be improved. When asserting a {{List}} result for example we often want to say that it contains "all items" rather than "all items in the specified order". We have that sort of gherkin language at the overall result level but not at the individual one.
