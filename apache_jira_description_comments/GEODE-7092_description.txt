Flaky test. In this CI run:

 

[https://concourse.gemfire-ci.info/teams/main/pipelines/gemfire-develop-main/jobs/DistributedTestOpenJDK8/builds/879]

 

These two tests failed:

 

ReconnectWithUDPSecurityDUnitTest > testReconnectOnForcedDisconnect

ReconnectWithUDPSecurityDUnitTest > testReconnectCollidesWithApplication

 

They both boil down to:

 

doTestReconnectOnForcedDisconnect() which calls 

getDistributedSystemProperties() to get property values to set. 

MEMBER_TIMEOUT is set to 1 second which is insufficient.
