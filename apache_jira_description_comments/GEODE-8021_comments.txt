GEODE-8021: CI Failure: CloseConnectionTest. sharedSenderShouldRecoverFromClosedSocket

fixing a marginally flaky test
  - ensure no bleed-through from other tests in ConnectionTable's
    ThreadLocal, which would cause getConnection to return the wrong
    sort of Connection
  - since Connections are multi-threaded and the state we're looking for
    is set by a background thread, use GeodeAwaitility to wait for the
    condition to be set.
