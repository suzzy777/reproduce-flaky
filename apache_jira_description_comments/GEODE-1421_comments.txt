The test does a get if key Integer(4) in "replicate2". "replicate1" has a CacheLoader so the get does  a netload from it. The test confirms that the get returns the correct value. It was also supposed to do a put of that value.
When it later confirms if the region contains key Integer(4) in "replicate1" that is the assertion that fails. It may also not exist in "replicate2"; the test does not get to that validation.

From looking at the test it looks to me like the get operation succeeds with the result from the loader even if we are critical (in which case the put is not done). So it seems like we are acting as if we are still critical at the time we did get(Integer(4)). The test asserts that it is not critical right before this get like so: 
        assertFalse(hmm.getState().isCritical());
I don't have any theories as to why this test would intermittently fail.


One of the things I learned is that when we do a get that does a load that still happens if we are critical. The get returns the loaded value; BUT the get does not store the value in the cache. I am going to modify the test to immediately assert after a get that does a load and should have stored the value the the region contains the key.

GEODE-1421: improve test to provide more info on failure

I ran the test 1000 times and they all passed.
Assertions are now done on the member that does
the get that should have also stored the entry
in the cache.


Could be a flaky test. I reran it 1000 times and they all passed.
The previous assertion that failed was on the remote member because it did not contain the key. I have added an assertion that is right after the get to confirm that it actually stored the loaded key in the region.
