First draft of the change. I would like to see how the unit test failures look if I add the diff value to the error message.

The duplicated issues were created when the ASF Jira was having issues and unfortunately I cannot close/resolve them.

Can you open a reviews.apache.org submission for this change?

Reuploading the same patch as the precommit tests didn't run.

Checked the test reports, and I like the new format :)

[~zsombor.klara] Is there any means to improve this error messages to make the root cause obvious? A lot of these failures have very obscure message. With this change, will this full stack trace for the exception still be printed into the test log file?

Thanks for taking a look at this [~ngangam].
I've changed the error message to make it clearer that the commands executed successfully but the diff failed.
The Hive server logs should have the same content as before, only the std err content and the  unit tests failure messages have changed.

+1

Pushed to master. Thanks, Barna!

This broke the build, please fix or revert

Tests ran and passed on Hive QA. Neither, I am not able to repro the failure locally. 

Sorry..  missed a new file in commit. Pushed that now!

There is a missing file in the commit (QTestProcessExecResult)
Probably not p0?

:) You were faster [~ashutoshc] :)

QTestProcessExecResult.java was committed with the title "Remaining file for HIVE-16184" (see commit 78d860ec58fa5159fa6a52c323f98bb175ee15bd) rather than "... for HIVE-15616".

An update to errata.txt seems to be in order.  For an example, see HIVE-11876.

I had a discussion with [~ashutoshc]. Previously, if we set "-Dtest.output.overwrite=true", we should see the test pass and the golden file be overwritten. Now, what i saw is 
{code}
<   Stage: Stage-8
<     Column Stats Work
<       Column Stats Desc:
<           Columns: key, value
<           Col
Output was too long and had to be truncated...

Tests run: 5, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
{code}

This changes the original behavior. What we are expecting is that: if we set "-Dtest.output.overwrite=true", it is OK to print the diff information as added by this patch, but please pass the test if the failure is just due to golden file change. This patch is going to be reverted. Could u please address the problem and resubmit the patch? Thanks.

Ahh sorry about that I forgot to test the new qfile generation. I will update the patch shortly.

Fixed qout overwrite problem.

Failed tests are flaky:
- TestSparkNegativeCliDriver is well known flaky HIVE-15165
- comments has been failing for 4 runs

I still find that tests are failed when golden file needs updating. [~zsombor.klara] Can you take a look?

I tested the golden file regeneration with a bunch of drivers Cli,Spark,Tez,MiniMR,HBase,LLap,Negative/Positive but couldn't find one that would fail. [~ashutoshc] could you please give me the driver type that you tried and that failed? 
Thanks.

Tested again. Working as expected.

Pushed to master. Thanks, Barna!

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
