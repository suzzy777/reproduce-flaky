Currently the DQ works as follows

* read all items in the directory
* sort them all 
* take the head and return it and discard everything else
* rinse and repeat

This works well when we have only a handful of items in the Queue. If the items in the queue is much larger (in tens of thousands) , this is counterproductive

As the overseer queue is a multiple producers + single consumer queue, We can read them all in bulk  and before processing each item , just do a zk.exists(itemname) and if all is well we don't need to do the fetch all + sort thing again
