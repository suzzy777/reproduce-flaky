    Fixed flakiness in MasterMaintenanceTest.InverseOffers.
    
    The accept/decline of the inverse offers in the test could arrive after
    the clock is paused and advanced in the test.  This meant that the test
    would trigger an allocation and then idle (because the clock is paused).
    This is the same problem we fixed in
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-4059 .
