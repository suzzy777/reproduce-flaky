Test {{SqlSystemViewsSelfTest.testTableViewDuringRebuilding}} fails sporadically. The reason is changes introduced due to the IGNITE-12684 issue.

There is race between runner thread and thread which completes future in {{IgniteH2Indexing#rebuildIndexesFromHash()}} method. Runner thread is unblocked due to the future completion and it tries to assert conditions while thread which completed the future changes state of index rebuild process.
