This issue supersedes our discussion in ZOOKEEPER-1989.

To summarize, ZK users can seamlessly upgrade 3.4 to 3.5. But two things will happen:
1. the server list will be separated out as a dynamic file (the original should be backup automatically).
2. Client port is mandatory on reconfig. So when reconfig the server itself (its id), the client port in config file will be removed and replaced by the one in reconfig (written in dynamic file).
