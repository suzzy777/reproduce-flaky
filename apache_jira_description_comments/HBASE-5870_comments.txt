In trunk, this bug was introduced in HBASE-5760.

@LarsH Hm, looks like this got committed here as HBASE-5848:

HBASE-5848 Addendum
{code} 

Maybe we should revert that and then recommit with a more appropriate commit message?



Lemme clean up this mess.

Reverted.

Test run looked good, though. So I'm +1 on commit.


I ran the patch against 0.23 profile.
I got one test failure:
{code}
testSimpleCase(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TestImportExport)  Time elapsed: 2.583 sec  <<< ERROR!
java.io.FileNotFoundException: File does not exist: /Users/zhihyu/.m2/repository/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common/0.23.2-SNAPSHOT/hadoop-common-0.23.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
{code}
But the jar was there:
{code}
-rw-r--r--  1 zhihyu  110088321  1768854 Apr 24 11:23 /Users/zhihyu/.m2/repository/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common/0.23.2-SNAPSHOT/hadoop-common-0.23.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
{code}

I ran into something similar but it was complaining about a ZK jar -- when testing HBASE-5861.  I think the error is from trying to find the jar in hdfs for the MR job.

Is this failure it consistent?

My guess is that something in HBASE-5760 is causing this.

The failure is consistent:

Patch v2 fills in obtainJobConf() for MapreduceV2Shim.

getJobTrackerConf() creates a new JobConf. So setting config param in the returned JobConf is not effective.

Even in build #136 TestImportExport failed, due to a different exception:
https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-TRUNK-on-Hadoop-23/136/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce/TestImportExport/org_apache_hadoop_hbase_mapreduce_TestImportExport/

I suggest checking in patch v2 and investigate TestImportExport using another JIRA.

The two failed tests passed locally.

+1.  (either as is or after addressing this following nit).

nit: Would throwing IllegalXxxException make sense instead of returning null?  Since this this is testing only I don't feel strongly about this but if it does end up going into the production code it would matter more.

Filing follow-on issue sounds good to me.

Will integrate later this afternoon if there is no objection.

This test didn't register -- TestSplitTransactionOnCluster -- I'm assuming this is a flaky and passes most of the time.

I ran the test suite and TestSplitTransactionOnCluster passed:
{code}
Running org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestSplitTransactionOnCluster
Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 50.737 sec
{code}
I ran it again standalone and it passed.

Integrated to trunk.

Thanks for the review, Lars and Jon.
