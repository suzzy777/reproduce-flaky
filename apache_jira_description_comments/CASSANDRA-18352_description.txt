In several cases it is desirable to have client provided timestamps generated at the application-level. This can be error prone, however. In particular, applications can choose timestamps that may be nonsensical for a given application. One dangerous manifestation of this is the "doomstone" (a tombstone far in the future of any realistic write). This feature would allow either operators or users to specify a minimum and maximum timebound of "reasonable" timestamps. The default would be negative infinity, positive infinity to maintain backwards compatibility. Writes that are USING TIMESTAMP with a timestamp outside of the timebox will see an exception.
