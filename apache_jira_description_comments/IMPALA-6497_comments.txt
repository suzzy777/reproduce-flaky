    IMPALA-6497: add "Last row fetched" and AC events
    
    This makes it more observable that all rows were returned to the client
    and also that resources were released for admission control.
    
    Testing:
    Manually inspected some query profiles.
    
    Added a basic observability test that ensures that the expected events
    appear in the profile. Ran it in a loop for a bit to make sure it wasn't
    flaky.
