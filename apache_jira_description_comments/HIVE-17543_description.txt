The PerfCliDriver contains .q files for TPC-DS queries. It doesn't actually run them, but it does generate explains for them. It also tricks HMS into thinking its a 30 TB TPC-DS dataset so that the explain plan triggers certain optimizations.

Right now this only runs of Hive-on-Tez, we should enable it for HoS too.
