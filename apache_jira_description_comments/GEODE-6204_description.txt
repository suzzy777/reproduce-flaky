Create a unit test for gfsh command {{netstat --with-lsof}} to verify that the correct options are added to the OS commands ({{netstat}} and {{lsof}}) that are run. The added options should disable DNS and port name lookups.

Tests using the command option {{--with-lsof}} currently exist as DUnit tests. This means that the command is run on at least one of the JVMs started up as part of the distributed test infrastructure. When using {{lsof}}, the command output can be very large, and take a long time (even when using {{-n}} option on the underlying shell command to not do DNS lookups). This all may result in flaky test results, either due to timeouts waiting for a response or due to OutOfMemoryExceptions caused by the massive Java objects created to hold the shell command output as a String.

The purpose of NetStatDUnitTest.testOutputToConsoleWithLsofForOneMember is ensure that the underlybing OS shell commands created by the gfsh command have the {{-n}} option applied for {{netstat}} and {{-nP}} for {{lsof}}.
