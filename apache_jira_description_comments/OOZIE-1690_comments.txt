found this test failure in other tickets, it is flaky one

Test failure is unrelated to this patch.

The Services should already be running when {{testEnvVar}} is running because they get started in the {{setUp}} method of the parent class, {{ActionExecutorTestCase}}.  Starting the Services again can lead to hard-to-track-down flaky test failures.  (On that note, in the future, whenever you start Services in a test, you should use a try-finally block to make sure the Services are always shutdown).  If you need to increase the max data property for the test, you should shut down the Services first.  

In ShellMain, have you tested that this doesn't cause a problem for Linux/Mac?  If so, we'll need to add a check for the OS.

Yes, you are right about Services will updated the patch.

The tests results are good with this change in ShellMain.

Canceling patch until isWindowsOS check is added. Can you also change the condition to replace :\\u to :\\\\u instead of replacing \\. Just replacing \\ might impact cases where a unicode character was actually intended by the user.

I commited the patch with your changes
Thanks for your advice
