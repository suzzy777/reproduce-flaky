Currently, within SCM a node can have the following states:

HEALTHY
STALE
DEAD
DECOMMISSIONING
DECOMMISSIONED

The last 2 are not currently used.

In order to support decommissioning and maintenance mode, we need to extend the set of states a node can have to include decommission and maintenance states.

It is also important to note that a node decommissioning or entering maintenance can also be HEALTHY, STALE or go DEAD.

Therefore in this Jira I propose we should model a node state with two different sets of values. The first, is effectively the liveliness of the node, with the following states. This is largely what is in place now:

HEALTHY
STALE
DEAD

The second is the node operational state:

IN_SERVICE
DECOMMISSIONING
DECOMMISSIONED
ENTERING_MAINTENANCE
IN_MAINTENANCE

That means the overall total number of states for a node is the cross-product of the two above lists, however it probably makes sense to keep the two states seperate internally.
