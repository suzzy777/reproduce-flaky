We set the scope to OWN while requesting the applications. [here|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/hadooplibs/hadoop-utils-2/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/LauncherMainHadoopUtils.java#L70]

Yarn checks if application is owned by the requester. [here|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/ClientRMService.java#L906-L907]
Owner of oozie process is the requester. 
But, application owner can be different from the owner of oozie process. We need to set scope to ALL. 
If we set scope to VIEWABLE and if user is setting view acl list on the application, then he/she need to include oozie process owner all the time, which sounds painful for user.
