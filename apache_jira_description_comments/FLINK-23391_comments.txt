Thanks for reporting this. I think this one is the same as FLINK-20928, which is caused by offset commit failure. Unfortunately the log didn't reveal quite much information. One possible solution would be capturing commit failure and make a retry.

[~renqs] do you have time looking into this problem? cc [~fpaul].

This one is quite similar to FLINK-20928, probably caused by the flaky {{NetworkFailureProxy}} between Flink and Kafka. I'll try to add a retry first and make a refactor on the current Kafka test infra after removing the legacy {{FlinkKafkaConsumer}} and {{{}FlinkKafkaProducer{}}}.

What is the plan time-wise for removing the {{FlinkKafkaConsumer}} and {{FlinkKafkaProducer}}?

I'm making a refactor for the Kafka test infra with KafkaContainer in FLINK-25249 , which should be able to fix this flaky test. The PR is in review now.

I'll first move some Kafka connector related instable test issues to the next cycle since the test infrastructure has been updated and we have not seen this issue for some time. If for a longer time it still not reproduce I think we could close this issue first.

I am the [Flink Jira Bot|https://github.com/apache/flink-jira-bot/] and I help the community manage its development. I see this issue is assigned but has not received an update in 30 days, so it has been labeled "stale-assigned".
