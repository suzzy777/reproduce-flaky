[~HildoYe] Thanks for opening this ticket. Can you elaborate on what's the flaky behaviour, since these tests are run every day and during every submitted PR? 

[~HildoYe] named rows are don't have a deterministic field order. The order is only deterministic after conversion / after serialization.

Could you elaborate why you need this patch?

I am the [Flink Jira Bot|https://github.com/apache/flink-jira-bot/] and I help the community manage its development. I see this issues has been marked as Minor but is unassigned and neither itself nor its Sub-Tasks have been updated for 180 days. I have gone ahead and marked it "stale-minor". If this ticket is still Minor, please either assign yourself or give an update. Afterwards, please remove the label or in 7 days the issue will be deprioritized.
