Hello,

We tried running this project and discovered that it contains some flaky tests (i.e., tests that nondeterministically pass and fail). We found these tests to fail more frequently when running them on certain machines of ours.

To prevent others from running this project and its tests in machines that may result in flaky tests, we suggest adding information to the README.md file indicating the minimum resource configuration for running the tests of this project as to prevent observation of test flakiness.

If we run this project in a machine with 1cpu and 1gb ram, we observe flaky tests. We found that the tests in this project did not have any flaky tests when we ran it on machines with 2cpu and 2gb ram.

Here is a list of the tests we have identified and their likelihood of failure on a system with less than the recommended 2 CPUs and 2 GB RAM.
 # org.apache.hc.core5.pool.TestPoolEntry#testExpiry
 # org.apache.hc.core5.pool.TestLaxConnPool#testCloseIdle
 # org.apache.hc.core5.testing.classic.ClassicIntegrationTest#testHttpPostsWithExpectContinue

Please let me know if you would like us to create a pull request on this matter (possibly to the readme of this project).

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We hope that our recommendations will be helpful in improving the quality and performance of your project, especially for others to use.

this configuration likely prevents flakiness (no flakiness in 10 runs)

$> docker run --rm --memory=2g --cpus=2 --memory-swap=-1 http-core | tee output.txt

this other configuration –similar to the previous– can’t prevent flaky tests (observation in 10 runs)

$> docker run --rm --memory=500m --cpus=1 --memory-swap=-1 http-core | tee output2.txt
