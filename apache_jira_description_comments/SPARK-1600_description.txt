the case "recovery with file input stream.recovery with file input stream  " sometimes fails when the Jenkins is very busy with an unrelated change 

I have met it for 3 times, I also saw it in other places, 

the latest example is in 

https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/14397/

where the modification is just in YARN related files....

I once reported in dev mail list: http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/a-weird-test-case-in-Streaming-td6116.html
