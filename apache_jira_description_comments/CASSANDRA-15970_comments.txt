Marked as 3.x only since this is upgrading from 2.x.  I assume the "fix" will be local to 3.x and won't impact 4.0, but if wrong will need to mark as 4.0 as well.

I am also ok if anyone wants to take this from me!

The dtest above needs the following JIRA to run: CASSANDRA-15969, CASSANDRA-15968, CASSANDRA-15967

thrift was added, now waiting on drain.

bq. Marked as 3.x only since this is upgrading from 2.x.

I'm confused, why is there a 2.2 patch?  Otherwise, LGTM.
 


Thanks [~brandon.williams] for the review!

bq. I'm confused, why is there a 2.2 patch?

This line https://github.com/dcapwell/cassandra/commit/52005e0061ea9ea8bf9c6ea782c75c39f23c0569#diff-31dfa99c0e891a6d048dd82581a3e6eeR69

{code}
// write table to pk=1
// NOTE: because jvm-dtest doesn't support collections in the execute interface (see CASSANDRA-15969)
// need to encode to a ByteBuffer first
coordinator.execute(withKeyspace("INSERT INTO %s.tbl (pk, tables) VALUES (?, ?)"), ConsistencyLevel.ONE, 1, MAP_TYPE.decompose(ImmutableMap.of(1, 1)));
{code}

For the upgrade test, we run the inserts in 2.2.  jvm-dtest doesn't support collection types, so need to convert to a ByteBuffer.  jvm-dtest uses org.apache.cassandra.utils.ByteBufferUtil#objectToBytes to go from Object -> ByteBuffer, and that method didn't support ByteBuffer -> ByteBuffer; this is the reason to update 2.2

I see. +1

upgrade test on 3.11 is flaky due to timeouts, I will refactor it so each test case is its own class =(

+1

not tagging 2.2 or trunk since the changes are utilities and keeping things in-sync; the bug was in 3.x so fixed version is only 3.x
