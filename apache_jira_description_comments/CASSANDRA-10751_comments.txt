Hey [~alexliu68], I've assigned it to you as I know you're the one who can easily guess what happens. Don't hesitate to assign it to someone else if you think I'm wrong. Thanks

The error indicates that C* node can't handle the load(Maybe there are too many splits). Do you try the latest C* 2.x or C*3.x?

Cassandra 2.1.11. It was working fine with 2.0.12

[~alexliu68] The number of splits has not changed and is the same as with 2.0.12. The strange errors are :

{code} 
I can see that the error "Error while setting keyspace" is displayed when there is a *ExecutionException*. It just weird that it happens so quickly ...

Can you get the full stacktrace by changing the log level of Host.STATES to TRACE?

[~alexliu68], so the issue is that CqlRecord calls cluster.connect using a [quoted keyspace string|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/hadoop/cql3/CqlRecordReader.java#L138] and that the java driver quotes it too when it accesses the keyspace using [CQL|https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/2.1.8/driver-core/src/main/java/com/datastax/driver/core/Connection.java#L477]. If I remove the first quote my job runs.

Cool, can you check latest C* 2.2.* and C*3.x. If possible, submit a patch.

[~alexliu68] Here are the patches for each version

[~alexliu68] did you get any chance to have a look at it ?

[~alexliu68] ?

Sorry [~cscetbon] that this got completely forgotten. The patch makes sense.

I've put your patch into relevant branches, and will commit once they go green.

[~mck] I got it in my cassandra package and happy that now it's in the mainstream !

Looking green. Trunk's {{test-all}} is already broken, waiting on CASSANDRA-14428.
And comparing failed dtests to their respective base branches:
 - 2.2: rebuild_test.TestRebuild.test_resumable_rebuild: no relation to the patch, already {{Flakiness: 37%}}
 - 3.0: stable {{bootstrap_test.TestBootstrap.test_simultaneous_bootstrap}} failed, tested locally ok.
 - 3.11: stable {{repair_tests.repair_test.TestRepair.test_thread_count_repair}} failed, tested locally ok.
 - trunk: 8 down to 2 existing failures.

Committed.

[~mck] the C* 3.0+ java drivers do not quote that.  This change is bad on versions 3.0+ and breaks stuff.

https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/3.0.8/driver-core/src/main/java/com/datastax/driver/core/Cluster.java#L336

(y) the driver does not quote the keyspace value given to {{Cluster.connect}} so this change will cause problems for mixed-case keyspaces.  To further expound on [~jjordan]'s comment, it's misleading but the [original code|https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/2.1.8/driver-core/src/main/java/com/datastax/driver/core/Connection.java#L477] referenced is quoting the value returned from a {{set_keyspace}} response sent by C*.  In that case, C* sends the internal form of the keyspace, which is never quoted, so we have to quote it there.

Right, even with the 2.2 java driver (that comes with C* 2.2) this does not apply.

Reverted.

Hey [~jjordan] [~mck] Are you saying that even before it wasn't needed ? I can guarantee that it was. That's been running for almost 2 years now on production. If it's not needed anymore, then great!

Andy, you're were quite right, i did a terrible job of reviewing that, no idea how i connected the methods when i looked at it.

[~cscetbon], what version of Cassandra are you running? Can you confirm it's a problem on 2.2+ ?

[~mck], It's a problem on 2.1.14. I haven't checked on another version
