    Simple! Great! And I think Ignite JDBC interpreter doesn't have any special thing. How do you think it merges into JDBC interpreter?

    Without the issue above, this PR looks good to me.

    @jongyoul Ignite JDBC interpreter has some specific options, so I need to investigate possibility of usage generic JDBC interpreter. I think the best way is to merge this PR in order to include new drivers in 0.6.0 release.

    @agura I'll thank you if you help merge Ignite JDBC into generic JDBC interpreter.
    
    And about this PR,  it looks good to me. Merging if there's no more discussion.

    @Leemoonsoo Could you please check that failure due to flaky test?

    @jongyoul first thing to do is to check JIRA `flaky-test` label and see if there is an existing issue for this failure.
    
    The CI failure is not related to the changes and is tracked under https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-888 I have added this failure to it.
    
    Looks good to me, merging if there is no further discussion
