    Looks like the Python2 CI test failed, could you take a look?

    @felixcheung 
    I opened the PR again, but there was errors elsewhere. Zeppelin test seems unstable.


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1742
  
    So there were 2 runs
    
    The older run https://travis-ci.org/apache/zeppelin/jobs/182613697 failed with Spark cluster tests
    The newer run https://travis-ci.org/apache/zeppelin/builds/183250971 failed with cassandra tests
    
    Given that and no code changes between, I think we could attribute the failures to flaky test.



Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1742
  
    @cuspymd have you tested this with Python 2.x and Python 3.x? I'm not sure we have automated test covered for Python + Spark on both.



Github user cuspymd commented on the issue:

    @felixcheung The script 'test_zeppelin_pr.py' could be run on only Python 2 before this PR.
    Anyway, I made additional modifications to run in python 3 as well.
    And  the script 'test_zeppelin_pr.py' is for development, not for ptyhon interpreter.
    I can't found a unit test about the scripts of 'dev' folder.
    Can you let me know if it exists, or do you think you need to test the scripts of 'dev' folder in the future?

    ah, sorry for missing this earlier. I didn't realize this is dev/test_* - these are test scripts that do not have automated tests
