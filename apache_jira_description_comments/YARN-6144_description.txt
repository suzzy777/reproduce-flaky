{{preemptContainers()}} calls {{trackContainerForPreemption()}} to collect the list of containers and resources that were preempted for an application. Later the list is reduced when {{containerCompleted()}} calls {{untrackContainerForPreemption()}}. The bug is that the resource variable {{preemptedResources}} is subtracted, not just when the container was preempted but also when it has completed successfully. This causes that we return an incorrect value in {{getResourceUsage()}}.
