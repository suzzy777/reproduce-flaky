Patch with proposed API change.  CollectionStateWatcher.onStateChange() now returns a boolean - true if the watcher doesn't need to be re-registered, false otherwise.

This also fixes the flaky testSimpleCollectionWatch() test.

Better patch, with some more tests.

SOLR-9113: Improve state watcher API


Seeing some test failures: http://jenkins.thetaphi.de/job/Lucene-Solr-6.x-Linux/686/

Test failures are due to a race between a watcher being removed, and then being re-added.  This a genuine bug, as it's possible that a second notification could be triggered between the watchers being cleared by a previous notification, and the watchers adding themselves again, which would lead to notifications being missed.

I'll switch the logic around, so that watchers are not removed by default, rather only if they return 'true' at notification time.

Fixes seem good to me!  I like the direction this went.
