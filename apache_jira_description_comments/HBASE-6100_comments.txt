Here again no takers :(
Moving to 0.94.2... Unless somebody thinks these are production code issue (rather then test code issues)

TestZooKeeper.testClientSessionExpired and TestServerCustomProtocol.testSingleMethod pass on our privte Hudson, and locally, so I think this is some evidence toward those being test code issues.

On our private Hudson, against Hadoop 2.0.1-SNAPSHOT, we see these failures:

org.apache.hadoop.hbase.TestLocalHBaseCluster.testLocalHBaseCluster
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestMetaMigrationRemovingHTD.org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestMetaMigrationRemovingHTD
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TestImportExport.testSimpleCase
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TestImportExport.testWithDeletes
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.wal.TestLogRolling.testLogRollOnPipelineRestart

TestLogRolling.testLogRollOnPipelineRestart is covered by HBASE-5995. Maybe this needs HDFS level tinkering.

The TestLocalHBaseCluster.testLocalHBaseCluster failure is some weird recursion in FileSystem.get leading to a StackOverflowError, so this particular failure instance may be specific to Hadoop 2.

I have some new team members needing training so part of that will be digging into these failures "real soon now".

I created this JIRA seeing some freq failures.  Pardon for not working on this as I din't find real good time for this.

@Ram: NP :) Thanks for filing the bug and keeping us all honest.

I looked through the last few failed run, did not see any of these test failing. I assume this is no longer a problem.
