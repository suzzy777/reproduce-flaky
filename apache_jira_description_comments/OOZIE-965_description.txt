The timezone attribute in coordinator jobs allows Java timezone IDs only (e.g. PST, America/Los_Angeles, GMT-##:##), but not GMT-####.  This can be confusing for users who set the oozie.processing.timezone property, which uses a format like GMT-#### only, as they cannot use the same formatting for their coordinator jobs.
