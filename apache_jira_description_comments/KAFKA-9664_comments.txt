[~ableegoldman] Where did this flaky test happen? I ask because I had a look into it and the line numbers do not match with 2.5 and the timeout was changed from 10000 ms in January 2019 and it has been never changed back again. It seems like this failure comes from a time when {{KafkaStreamsTest#testStateThreadClose()}} still was a test that used embedded Kafka.

Huh...I can't seem to track down where I saw this, and the timeout is fishy. Maybe I was running tests on a really old version of the 2.5 branch?Â 

I guess we should just close this for now

Thank you for checking! Will close the ticket.
