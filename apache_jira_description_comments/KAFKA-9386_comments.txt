rajinisivaram commented on pull request #7911: KAFKA-9386; Apply delete ACL filters to resources from filter even if not in cache
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7911
 
 
   With the old SimpleAclAuthorizer, we were handling delete filters that matched a single resource by looking up that resource directly, even if it wasn't in the cache. AclAuthorizerTest.testHighConcurrencyDeletionOfResourceAcls relies on this behaviour and fails intermittently when the cache is not up-to-date. This PR includes the resource from non-matching filters even if it is not in the cache to retain the old behaviour.
