In the initial migration to CMake there wasn't a way to mark tests as disabled in CTest. Our solution was to use {{LABELS}}. The use of labels can result in unexpected execution of a test during {{--rerun-failed}} or {{-R}} options. As of CMake 3.9 you can disabled at test with the {{DISABLED}} property.
