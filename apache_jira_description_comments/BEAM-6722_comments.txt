Hmmm, I'm not sure it's related since I don't see any port conflict issues.

Right, probably not related. I just thought you might have an idea what caused this because you were working on the tests recently.

[just saw this|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7934#issuecomment-468457176]

Hi guys, As I introduced embedded Cassandra backend in the IO tests, I'll fix this issue. It is very common (as discussed) that embedded backends cause flakiness. But it is the price to pay for more relevant tests :)

It seems that embedded cassandra did not start within timeout leading to null Cluster leading to a NPE in the "@AfterClass" cleaning method. Default startup timeout is 20s, raising to 45s as it was default timeout in spark cassandra connector

[~echauchot] is this resolved, or is there still more to take care of?

[~aromanenko] [~echauchot] should this be assigned to one of you? I see two PRs open for this.

[~kenn] PR is under review. I was off last week. This is why it is not yet merged. I assigned the ticket to me

[~kenn] FYI, I just merged the https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8000 PR
