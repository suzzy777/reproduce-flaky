Initial attempt at improving this is found in this patch here: https://github.com/thelastpickle/cassandra/blob/mck/17869/trunk/.jenkins/Jenkinsfile#L291-L301

It's only touches on what is requested here, just reporting disk usage. But it's approach in keeping reports per agent is new, and can be re-used for poorman's monitoring.

Currently the patch is part of CASSANDRA-17869, but I plan on opening a new jira to cover this rewrite of the Jenkinsfile.

I branched offÂ {{remotes/tlp/mck/17869/trunk and have a first stab at this on a branch [here|https://github.com/josh-mckenzie/cassandra/commit/12ea8ff24f974d75be52bd39324db880481d2806]. It passes validation/linting as indicated at the top of the Jenkinsfile but I haven't tested it yet; I believe [you have an env up and running|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-17869?focusedCommentId=17656615&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17656615] we might be able to check this on for [~mck] ?}}

bq. I believe you have an env up and running we might be able to check this on for Michael Semb Wever ?

Yes, but it's not big enough to handle a pipeline build. Let me loop back on this later in the week, ok?

Certainly; this is going to depend on progress on CASSANDRA-17869 for the pipeline integration so best to keep focus there.

Let's unblock this from both 17869 and 18133, and put what we need into the groovy dsl asap.

Here's the patch on 4.0: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/cassandra-4.0...thelastpickle:cassandra:mck/18130/4.0

and CI: https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/2257/

brain-fart. this patch  only logs on the built-in where the pipeline runs, not the stage jobs. the patch (before CASSANDRA-18133) needs to go in cassandra-builds/jenkins-dsl/

tackling this pre 18133 is a bit too much for my time availability. so leaving this 'in progress' and to focus on 18133.
