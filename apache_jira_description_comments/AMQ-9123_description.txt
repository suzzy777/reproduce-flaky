Matt noticed that when ManagedRegionBroker is stopped only the registered mbeans are cleaned up but the various collections that hold queues, topics, subscribers, etc. are never cleared. Therefore, if a broker is stopped and started the caches will have previous run data in them.

This code appears to have been this way since 2006 but we should likely clean up the collections when the broker is stopped assuming there are no intended side-effects in leaving them with previous run data.
