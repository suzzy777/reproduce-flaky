KAFKA-12339 incompatibly changed the semantics of Admin.listOffsets(). Previously it would fail with {{UnknownTopicOrPartitionException}} when a topic didn't exist. Now it will (eventually) fail with {{TimeoutException}}. It seems this was more or less intentional, even though it would break code which was expecting and handling the {{UnknownTopicOrPartitionException}}. A workaround is to use {{retries=1}} and inspect the cause of the {{TimeoutException}}, but this isn't really suitable for cases where the same Admin client instance is being used for other calls where retries is desirable.

Furthermore as well as the intended effect on {{listOffsets()}} it seems that the change could actually affect other methods of Admin.

More generally, the Admin client API is vague about which exceptions can propagate from which methods. This means that it's not possible to say, in cases like this, whether the calling code _should_ have been relying on the {{UnknownTopicOrPartitionException}} or not.
