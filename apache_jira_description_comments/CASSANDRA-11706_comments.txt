Contains the fix, and one log line improved.

Updated the patch so that the log line improvement now uses String.format(..)

I might be missing something, but, for instance [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/tracing/Tracing.java#L138-L141] the {{customPayload}} is ignored as well. Is it intended? 

In the same way, [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/tracing/Tracing.java#L156] it is ignored, too, although I assume here it might be intended to be overriden. 

Could you give a bit more context?

Is this still on your radar, [~mck]?

^ oh no, someone took my alias! I'm working on this today.

The latest patch also includes a unit test, and is ready for review.

That's for catching the former [~ifesdjeen]. The latter as you say is intended to be overridden. I've add a comment stating that.

The latest patch also includes a unit test, ensuring the customPayload is passed through.

Thanks for the patch! +1 from my side.

I've triggered CI just in case, will transfer it to ready to commit when they pass:

|[trunk patch |https://github.com/ifesdjeen/cassandra/tree/11706-trunk] |[dtest patch|https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/1281]|[utest|https://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/ifesdjeen/job/ifesdjeen-11706-trunk-testall/] |[dtest|https://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/ifesdjeen/job/ifesdjeen-11706-trunk-dtest/] |

Unit Test results look good, as {{KeyCacheCqlTest}} is flaky on trunk.

Dtests got broken because of the change in the log format. I've submitted dtest patch [here|https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/1281] and re-triggered dtest.

I completely forgot about {{CHANGES.txt}}. Could you ninja-add a commit line with a ticket number to changes file (I don't have commit access)?
Thanks!

done. CHANGES.txt is not mentioned in either how to review or commit in the in-tree documentation.
