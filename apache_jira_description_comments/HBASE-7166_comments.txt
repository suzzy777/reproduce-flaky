There appear to be different attempts to fix this. Some in trunk only, and slightly different in different tests.

Is this test known to have problems with (Open)Jdk7? It seems I cannot run this test at all at home in 0.94.


Here's a 0.94 patch, that just waits a bit for the split to finish. Waits up to 10s, which should be good enough.
(Tested on my work machine with JDK 6)

Here's a 0.96 patch.
I ran TestSplitTransactionOnCluster locally.

Oops. Didn't save a file.

This one fixes yet another race where a ZK node does not disappear in time.

I think these changes are uncontroversial. Will commit soon, unless there are objections.

Same for 0.94

{code}
+  private List<HRegion> assertDaughters(byte[] tableName)
{code}
I wouldn't expect an assertion to return a List. Rename the method to getDaughters() ?

It does assert in that method, though.
Happy to change the name on commit. Fine otherwise?

{code}
+        Thread.sleep(1000);
{code}
Would suggest shortening the sleep interval. You can increase number of iterations if 10 second wait is needed.

Fair enough... Going to commit with Ted suggestions. Thanks Ted.

*v3 is what I committed.
Hopefully this will decrease the failure rate of these tests.

Committed to 0.94 and 0.96

Yeah baby, the first successful jenkins run in trunk since almost 30 builds!
(0.94 failed on something else :( )

/me sweet!
