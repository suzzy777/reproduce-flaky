I am curious about how this might work (I'm new to the codebase) and I was wondering how can you check for ongoing preview repairs? (The closest thing I could find is theÂ PendingTasks compaction metric). Is there a better way?

I'll post the patch soon, but we keep track of {{ParentRepairSession}} in {{ActiveRepairService}}

[patch|https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commits/marcuse/15854] (on top of CASSANDRA-15851 to get byte buddy support)

I'm not able to reproduce the failure in {{StreamingInboundHandlerTest}} in a few local runs, but it also doesn't seem to have a flaky test Jira. Will have to investigate further...

The dtest failure in {{TestRepair}} looks like CASSANDRA-15861, but {{test_cleanup}} in {{bootstrap_test.TestBootstrap}} doesn't look like it's been reported yet.

This isn't related directly to the patch, but there are a couple places ({{CassandraValidationIterator}} and {{RepairMessageVerbHandler}}) where we believe {{ActiveRepairService#getParentRepairSession()}} can return {{null}}. It seems pretty clear, though, that we'll always throw a {{RuntimeException}} before we allow that to happen.

[~marcuse] I've left the comments from my first pass of review [inline|https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/0da4b6ca0180efae9cbf22bf5eee77d2aa3b936e].

Sorry for the delay [~maedhroz] - I've pushed a few commits addressing your comments - and the test was horrible, I've pushed a simpler version which makes it clearer what is going on

[~marcuse] Thanks!

Left a few more very [minor nits|https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/0f81a451bba4e2d40babe6fdacfb9565abe42775], but otherwise LGTM ;)

[~maedhroz] pushed the nit fixes

Left my comments on https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/614b8da34660cc86305a26d33c47883cb5f603e7; my main comments are on the test.

Been running the tests in a loop to make sure not flaky, found this failure

Seems an inconsistency was found; this was on the branch without changes.

This failed after the 13th run with lower resources (2 physical cores; 4 hyper-threaded).

Rewrote the test again, ran it in a loop 80 times with lower resources, no failures

Noticed that we stream even if the repair fails right before we get the validation response, that might have been what caused your failure.

cci run: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/krummas/cassandra/541/workflows/8d3cbf9c-6556-45d9-b993-e258b3211323

seems {{IncrementalRepairCoordinatorTimeoutTest}} failed, looks unrelated and passes locally

thanks, ill file a jira and take that exception

{code}
Error message 'Got negative replies from endpoints [/127.0.0.2:7012]' does not contain any of [Did not get replies from all endpoints.]
{code}

the test validates the repair fails but getting wrong message periodically it seems, so needs to be root caused and fixed.

tests LGTM +1

committed with a small change - moved the parent repair session check to {{RepairJob#executeTask}}, test run [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/krummas/cassandra/543/workflows/555d874f-8c47-41b0-bf95-80aeb9a75188] (dtest failure is tracked in CASSANDRA-16094, looks unrelated to this), thanks
