When a process is terminated, any outstanding delay() destined for that process aren't terminated, meaning they arrive whenever the clock happens to get there. With uniquely named processes this isn't an issue, but with names that are reused (master), it could potentially lead to odd test flakiness, and is artifacts carrying across / between tests which shouldn't be.
