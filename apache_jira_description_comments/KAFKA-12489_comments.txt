I have made some changes in [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12197] which should help us understand whether the test is failing since file is directory or because it doesn't exist! Note that one of the problems is that we are not asserting the return value of File.createNewfiles() API, which could potentially be false. After this PR is merged in, we should see better exception messages to highlight the problem when this test fails.
