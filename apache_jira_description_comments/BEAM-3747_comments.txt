Thanks for creating this issue. I also noticed that but wanted to observe it a little bit more. I think this can be related: BEAM-2659 but I'm not sure yet.  

Both JDBC and HadoopInputFormatIO tests are flaky due to this error.

 

 

fixing the "false - negative" test results was part of the solution.

[~chamikara] you're right. What is more - every test that uses some sort of external database may experience similar issues (eg. MongoIOIT, that is on it's way). Editing the issue.

Not flaky any more thanks to solutions provided in subtasks
