When a preview repair on repaired data identifies which SSTables to validate, it might come across an SSTable that's still pending for an in-progress incremental repair session. It makes sense that we immediately fail the preview repair in that case, but the resulting error and verbose stack trace in the logs is a bit too severe a reaction. We should downgrade this to a simple warning message.
