There're several ways to load interpreter-setting.json, but for now we will load it multiple times. It is supposed to load only once. 

Here's the order to register interpreter
* load from <ZEPPEPLEIN_HOME>/conf/<interpreter_group>/interpreter-setting.json
* load from interpreter process classpath
* register interpreter using the old way of Interpreter.register()
