Added authorization for V1 events.

Added authorization filtering for the master V1 operator event

principal is authorized to see. The new test
'MasterAPITest.EventAuthorizationFiltering' verifies this
behavior.

The above commit introduced the test {{MasterAPITest.EventAuthorizationFiltering}} which is flaky.
