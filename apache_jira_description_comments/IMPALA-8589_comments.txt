IMPALA-8589: Re-enable flaky test_query_event_hooks.py

This patch fixes the flaky test_query_event_hooks.py. The patch also
cuts down the waiting time for impalad timeout to 5 seconds from the
default 60 seconds especially for those tests that will fail Impala
startup.

Testing:
- Ran test_query_event_hooks.py in a loop.

While this ticket did improve the wait time on expected-failing tests, I don't think it actually fixed the "flakiness" of the passing case.  The {{test_query_event_hooks_execute}} test case originally checked for execution of {{QueryEventHook.onQueryComplete}}, but now only checks for {{QueryEventHook.onImpalaStartup}}.

Since {{onQueryComplete}} executes asynchronously and {{onImpalaStartup}} does not, I think this is the reason that the flakiness of the tests has gone away.  We probably need to restore coverage for {{onQueryComplete}} execution at some point.
