tombentley commented on pull request #8317: KAFKA-9691: Fix NPE by waiting for reassignment request
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8317
 
 
   It seems likely the NPE reported in KAFKA-9691 was due to the call to `alterPartitionReassignments()` returning but the reassignment request not being completed yet, so try to fix it by calling `get()` on the returned `KafkaFuture`.
