fixed trailing space (most of them from doc/twiki)
>132 alert is from doc/twiki
run failed test locally and confirmed it works. it is flaky one.

now committed to trunk. thanks for review

This commit breaks existing oozie client API of {code}public CoordinatorJob getCoordJobInfo(String jobId, String filter, int start, int len){code}

will take a look

For people using oozie client API, they will have compilation error when running against oozie trunk.

ok i will add something like this to fix backward compatibility
{code}
public CoordinatorJob getCoordJobInfo(String jobId, String filter, int start, int len) {
 return getCoordJobInfo(String jobId, String filter, int start, int len, "asc")
}
{code}

uploading amendment patch (for diff), will run test cases just in case before commit
