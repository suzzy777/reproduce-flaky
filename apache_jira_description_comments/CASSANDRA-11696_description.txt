Incremental repairs are tracked using a parent session - a subordinate repair session is created for each range in the repair. When a node participating in the repair receives a validation request, it will reference the sstables in the parent repair session. When all subordinate sessions conclude, each node anticompacts SSTables based on the parent repair session for the whole range of the repair, but these referenced SSTables may have only been present for the validation of some subset of the ranges because the SSTables were created concurrent with the parent repair session.
