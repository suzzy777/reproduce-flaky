n.b. this bug has been verified with exactly-once processing enabled

Consider the following scenario:
 * A record, N is read into a Kafka topology
 * the state store is updated
 * the topology crashes

h3. *Expected behaviour:*
 # Node is restarted
 # Offset was never updated, so record N is reprocessed
 # State-store is reset to position N-1
 # Record is reprocessed

h3. *Actual Behaviour*
 # Node is restarted
 # Record N is reprocessed (good)
 # The state store has the state from the previous processing

I'd consider this a corruption of the state-store, hence the critical Priority, although High may be more appropriate.

I wrote a proof-of-concept here, which demonstrates the problem on Linux:
