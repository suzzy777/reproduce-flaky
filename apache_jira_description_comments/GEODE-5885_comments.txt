GEODE-5885: Exclude geode-core from geode-[jd]unit dependencies. (#2640)

* This exclusion will not be necessary once the java-library plugin is stable with publishing.
* At that future date, we may use the 'implementation' configuration rather than 'compile' in geode-[jd]unit, avoiding leaking geode-core to other modules.
