    FALCON-1978 : Fix flaky unite test MetadataMappingServicesTests

    1. Ordered the tests so that parallel execution will not cause assert failures
    2. There was an issue found in EntityGraphRelationshipBuilder that was causing MetadataMappingServicesTests.testOnClusterEntityChange(), but it seems that has been fixed in the trunk.
