GEODE-6973: Use cachelistener to synchronize typeToId with IdToType r… (#3853)

* GEODE-6973: Use cachelistener to synchronize typeToId with IdToType region in
            PeerTypeRegistrationm, then when creating a new json pdxType, no need
            to look up in IdToType region. This will speed up creating new pdxType.
