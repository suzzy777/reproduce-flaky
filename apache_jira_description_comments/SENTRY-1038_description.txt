Currently, the client lets you specify bogus actions or no action at all.  The service doesn't report anything back to the client in these cases, although it does seem to do the correct thing (at least for bogus actions, it doesn't return the privilege when you list it).  In order to improve the user experience, we can check this on the client side and give useful hints.
