I think this is one of the cases where temp files on the CI infrastructure are simply flaky.

Moving this test to {{fromElements()}} and {{collect()}}

    I pushed some commits here:
    [https://github.com/ggevay/flink/tree/sorter-codegen](https://github.com/ggevay/flink/tree/sorter-codegen)
    
    I fixed one issue by adding the `CLUSTER_WITH_CODEGENERATION_ENABLED` case to the switch in `DriverBaseITCase.getSystemOutput`.
    
    However, the randomly occurring `FileNotFoundException` is more tough to fix. I think this is happening because of some Travis bug around creating temporary files. Here are some Jiras that might be the same issue:
    [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-2498](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-2498)
    [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-2719](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-2719)
    The only fix that I can think of is to not compile the generated code from a file, but generate it into a string, and use that overload of `cook` that takes a string instead of a file. (But we might still want to also write the generated code to a file, to be able to look at the generated code for debugging purposes. We just won't use that file for compiling.)
