hbase-rest module still has imports from org.apache.commons.httpclient .

There is more work to be done after HBASE-15767 was integrated.

In master branch, there seems to be transitive dependency which allows the code to compile:

    https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5262 : http/conn/ssl/SSLConnectionSocketFactory.java in Apache HttpComponents HttpClient before 4.3.6 ignores the http.socket.timeout configuration setting during an SSL handshake, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (HTTPS call hang) via unspecified vectors.

    https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-5783
    Apache Commons HttpClient 3.x, as used in Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS) merchant Java SDK and other products, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
