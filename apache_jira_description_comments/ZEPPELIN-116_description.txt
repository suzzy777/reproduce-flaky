Support Mahout-Samsara + Spark interpreter (similar to Samsara Shell).

Since Mahout-Samsara can run on top of Spark, h20 and soon, Flink, I guess it needs separate interpreters for all these backends. Plus, since it is an add-on, it needs to cover individual capabilitis of spark/flink interpreters too go give an add-on functionality on top of these.

One particular question i have is whether it is worth to extends existing spark interpreter to inherit its capabilities, or clone-and-modify.
