Hi, [~avijayan], I'm try to help fixing issues for non-rolling upgrade.

I've runned the failing case "TestCloseContainerHandler" on theÂ HDDS-3698-nonrolling-upgrade for several times, but it seems to be fixed by some pr accidentally?

[~markgui] Thanks for testing out the flaky integration test. I will mark it as fixed, but keep this JIRA open until branch merge into master. 

Resolving since upgrade related tests have been fixed.
