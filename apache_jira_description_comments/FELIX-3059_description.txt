Require-Bundle with visibility:=reexport does not work transitively in Felix 3.2.2 (cannot comment wrt. other versions, only tested this one).

Similar issue with Felix M2 plugin described in http://www.mail-archive.com/felix-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg02622.html.

See attached zip for an example consisting of 4 bundles as described in [1].

Example works in Equinox, fails to load a.One in Felix 3.2.2.
