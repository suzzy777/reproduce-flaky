{{NioEchoServer}} does not close the selectors that it opens. The result of this can be manifested in flaky tests because the JVM/OS can run out of available file descriptors if the {{NioEchoServer}} is used in a lot of tests. Each test then leaks a handful of descriptors, and eventually the 'too many open files' error is thrown.

This was compounded because the {{NioEchoServer}} intentionally doesn't output stack traces, so the underlying issue was hidden and was manifest in odd (flaky) ways in tests.
