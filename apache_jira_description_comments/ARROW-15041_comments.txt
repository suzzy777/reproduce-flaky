This seems to have something to do with the order in which the 2 files are created and subsequently brought together with {{open_dataset()}}. Creating file 2 first doesn't trigger a test failure. 

{code:r}
  temp_dir <- make_temp_dir()
  writeLines("\xef\xbb\xbfa,b\n1,2\n", con = file.path(temp_dir, "file1.csv"))
  writeLines("\xef\xbb\xbfa,b\n3,4\n", con = file.path(temp_dir, "file2.csv"))

  expect_equal(
    open_dataset(temp_dir, format = "csv") %>% collect(),
    tibble(a = c(1, 3), b = c(2, 4))
  )
{code}
