Yeah, we can disable those if we want, the solution to the flakiness is actually in DuckDB, which they have already solved and we are waiting for a release before we can merge https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11482 which should be much more reliable.

They have a pre-release just out today, so their full release should happen soon.

Ok, so let's just wait for them and bump the dependency version number?

OH, actually looking at the logs it looks like they *did* send their pre-release to CRAN and it's being picked up now (I didn't think they sent their pre-releases to CRAN, but glad they do in this case!)

2021-11-17T09:06:25.9842873Z #13 119.6 duckdb     (NA -> 0.3.1) [CRAN]
{code}

So we can merge that other ticket (I need to clean it up first, but I'll do that...). It's odd that it is suddenly more flakey (the actual fix we were waiting for is basically a fully different mechanism we were using before to clean up after ourselves, so the one we have in the master branch now should be just as flakey as it was before, but clearly not ðŸ¤·)
