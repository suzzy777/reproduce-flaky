Taking a look at the error stack above (also available at [https://master-02.jenkins.cloudera.com/job/impala-cdh6.x-core/781/testReport/org.apache.impala.planner/PlannerTest/testEmpty/]), it seems that the deserialized result “val” (of type TResultRow) at [https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/fe/src/main/java/org/apache/impala/service/FeSupport.java#L200] is not as expected. It is expected to be a list of TColumnValue’s consisting of exactly 1 element (this is also what I have seen when I attached a debugger to impalad via port 30000), however, the message included in the error stack shows that that list is of null value (colVals:null).

After comparing the variable exprBatch around [https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/fe/src/main/java/org/apache/impala/service/FeSupport.java#L199], I found that the contents of exprBatch provided above and the contents of exprBatch I have observed on my dev box (via a debugger) are exactly the same.

On the other hand, I have also tried to observe the contents in the variable result on my dev box after [https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/fe/src/main/java/org/apache/impala/service/FeSupport.java#L199]. It is a byte array consisting of the following 14 elements: [15, 0, 1, 12, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. 

The following are the two things I can think of that might go wrong.

(1) It may be possible that there is something wrong with the values in the variable “result”, which are returned from the BE at [https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/fe/src/main/java/org/apache/impala/service/FeSupport.java#L194]. To conduct a more detailed investigation, we may have to get more detailed information about the stack contents when that java.lang.IllegalStateException happened.

(2) It may also be possible that there is something wrong with the function call “deserializer.deserialize” at “[https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/fe/src/main/java/org/apache/impala/service/FeSupport.java#L199]“.

 

[~tarmstrong], [~fangyurao], I think this is a flaky test and may not be a blocker. Can we change the target version to 3.4.0?

I'm going to close as cannot reproduce, since we have no leads on this
