The coordinator currently waits indefinitely if it does not hear back from a backend. This could cause a query to hang indefinitely in case of a network error, etc.

We should add logic for determining when a backend is unresponsive and kill the query. The logic should mostly revolve around Coordinator::Wait() and Coordinator::UpdateFragmentExecStatus() based on whether it receives periodic updates from a backed (via FragmentExecState::ReportStatusCb()).
