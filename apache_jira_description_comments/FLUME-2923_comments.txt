This patch changes version of AsyncHBase from 1.5.0 to 1.7.0.

According to the documentation ( http://opentsdb.github.io/asynchbase/docs/build/html/installation.html#upgrading ), backwards-compatibility is guaranteed, only needs changing the version number.

After applying the patch the build remains successful.

I believe this is important for supporting newer versions of HBase. Let's pull this in if the unit tests pass.

[~bessbd]: Did you run the asynchbase unit tests after applying this patch?

I get a bunch of failures. Are you seeing the same thing?

Note that the above command causes all tests to pass for me on trunk without applying your patch.

[~mpercy]: Please find the new patch attached. The tests for flume-ng-sinks/flume-ng-hbase-sink seem to be running fine again now.

@bessbd Thanks for updating the patch. Please update the netty version in the parent pom.xml file in the dependencyMananagement section instead of the child pom, since netty is used by multiple components: https://github.com/apache/flume/blob/trunk/pom.xml#L1311

You will also need to run all of the Flume unit tests because of that change.

[~mpercy]: I have updated the netty version in the parent pom.xml. Please, see the latest patch attached.
The tests you have provided in one of the previous comment seem to be working fine, as well as the other Flume unit tests.

+1 looks good. The Kafka source unit tests are not passing for me but I think they're broken or flaky in general. I'm going to commit this.

FLUME-2923. Bump asynchbase version to 1.7.0

Newer versions of HBase and the asynchbase library support error types
such as RegionMovedException. Also, asynchbase has incorporated several
fixes since version 1.5.0.

See https://github.com/OpenTSDB/asynchbase/blob/v1.7.0/NEWS

Committed to trunk. Thanks for the patch, [~bessbd]!
