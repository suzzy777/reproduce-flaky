    Fixed flaky SlaveTest.RegisteredAgentReregisterAfterFailover.
    
    Previously due to a race condition a registration retry could be held
    in the authorizer and forwarded back to the master only after the
    agent's disconnection is detected, which leads to a remove registrar
    operation when the test asserts there's none.
