Need to improve e2e tests in the following areas:
 - Tests should not be flaky
 - Remove the sleep ( This should implicitly make the tests run faster)
 - Truncate HBase table 'metron_update' before starting the tests
 - Improve the tests descriptions
 - Run the tests headless if possible
 - Check the node version and browser version before launching the tests

The expected behavior is that there are no intermittent failures. Acceptance criteria: 5 consecutive runs without failures.
