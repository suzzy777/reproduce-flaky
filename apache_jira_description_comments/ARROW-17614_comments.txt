This also seems to happen on PRs, see for example https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/14032

Hmm, my guess is this is probably caused by https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/13912 .  I will try and find some time to investigate soon.

I will also take a look.

An update, currently some of our nightlies packaging jobs and verification tasks fail since the following commit was merged: [https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/0527197c0f26d5b65678cd63573583165cf645f1] which is the PR [~westonpace] suggested.

These are the latest nightly failures related:
