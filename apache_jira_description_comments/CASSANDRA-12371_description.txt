Contrary to what is written down on http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cql/json.html#json-encoding-of-cassandra-data-types, numbers are not an accepted format for tinyints and smallints.

Steps to reproduce on CQLSH:

> create table default.test(id text PRIMARY KEY, small smallint, tiny tinyint);

> INSERT INTO default.test JSON '{"id":"123","small":11}';
InvalidRequest: Error from server: code=2200 [Invalid query] message="Error decoding JSON value for small: Expected a short value, but got a Integer: 11"

> INSERT INTO default.test JSON '{"id":"123","tiny":11}';
InvalidRequest: Error from server: code=2200 [Invalid query] message="Error decoding JSON value for tiny: Expected a byte value, but got a Integer: 11"

The good news is that when you wrap the numeric values into strings - it works like a charm.
