By adding the following configs inÂ fe/src/test/resources/ranger-hive-audit.xml, we can enabled audit logs to log4j:
{code:xml}
   <property>
    <name>xasecure.audit.is.enabled</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>xasecure.audit.destination.log4j</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
{code}
However, it's just audits in the client side. E.g. we can find these in impalad.INFO after executing a query:
{code:java}
I0317 14:19:16.222668 18674 Log4JAuditDestination.java:107] {"repoType":3,"repo":"test_impala","reqUser":"quanlong","evtTime":"2021-03-17 14:19:16.089","access":"select","resource":"functional/alltypestiny","resType":"@table","action":"select","result":1,"agent":"impala","policy":2,"enforcer":"ranger-acl","cliIP":"::ffff:127.0.0.1","reqData":"select id from functional.alltypestiny","agentHost":"quanlong-OptiPlex-BJ","logType":"RangerAudit","id":"662c97a5-0cb5-42e0-bd09-13e8473ef0f7-0","seq_num":0,"event_count":1,"event_dur_ms":0,"tags":[],"cluster_name":"test-cluster","policy_version":2207}

{code}
The "policy" field shows which policy takes effect. The "result" field shows whether the access is allowed.

For debugging e2e test like IMPALA-10587, we still need the access audits about policies. Something that's shown in Ranger Admin Web UI: Audits->Admin
 !Ranger Admin Access Audit.png|width=780,height=367!

I think we should either dumping the results of it or enable DEBUG logging for ranger.

IMPALA-10401: Enable Ranger audit logs to log4j

This patch enables audit logging to log4j for Ranger plugins, which
provides us with more info in debugging flaky test failures. The audits
are logged by Log4JAuditDestination. Each line shows which policy takes
effect and whether the access is allowed.

For FE tests, the log file is in logs/fe_tests/FeSupport.INFO. For e2e
and custom cluster tests, the audits are logged in log files of
processes that have ranger plugins (e.g. catalogd, cooridnator).

Tests:
 - Manually verify the audit logs exist.
