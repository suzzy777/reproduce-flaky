I updated the summary to describe the problem, not the fix. Can you update your commit message to match? Feel free to force-push to the PR's branch.

I don't think this PR can be committed as is. We are currently able to run tests from the IDE as junit tests (circumventing Gradle). Having to add {{-Dtest.surefire.dir}} to the JVM arguments would cause a lot of friction. There needs to be a default location.

Also someone should update the documentation. For instance, the javadoc for DiffRepository is inconsistent with the new behavior.

I appreciate your work identifying this issue, [~adayal]. Can someone take it to completion?

[~julianhyde] Thanks for pointing that out. Hmm what if we check to see if the property exists, if not it does what it was doing before? Would that work for IDE use-cases?

The effect of that fix would be that incremental builds would be flaky for IDE users. They wouldn't even know what they were doing wrong. So I don't think it's the right fix.

What do you think of the following? When running Quidm tests, a file such as
{noformat}
core/src/test/resources/sql/agg.iq
{noformat}
which is copied to
{noformat}
core/build/resources/test/sql/agg.iq
{noformat}
should generate its output to
{noformat}
core/build/quidem/test/sql/agg.iq
{noformat}
 

Similarly, when running DiffRepository tests, a file such as
{noformat}
core/src/test/resources/org/apache/calcite/test/SqlToRelConverterTest.xml
{noformat}
which is copied to
{noformat}
core/build/resources/test/org/apache/calcite/test/SqlToRelConverterTest.xml
{noformat}
should generate its output to
{noformat}
core/build/diffrepo/test/org/apache/calcite/test/SqlToRelConverterTest.xml
{noformat}
 

In each of these cases, files 1 and 2 will be the same file 3 will be different if the test fails. If the new output is better, the developer should copy file 3 to file 1 and commit.

Do you think that those new {{quidem}} and {{diffrepo}} directories will work correctly with Gradle?

I think that should work. Essentially as long as QuidemTest and DiffRepository don't write to:
{code:java}
build/resources/test{code}
 then it won't cause issues with Gradle incremental builds.

The next question is how is the output path formed - do we use system properties or some sort of replacement of resources -> diffrepo/quidem. From what you mentioned earlier the system properties approach doesn't work with running tests from editors?

QuidemTest and DiffRepository figure out the output path from the input path. No settings required.

[~julianhyde] Please take a look at [https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3280] - I've closed the previous PR.

I'm not sure about the code smell alert - resources does appear 3 times in the file - should I go ahead and make it into a constant?

Fixed in [d4276bcc|https://github.com/apache/calcite/commit/d4276bcc19523285ed9385a52741d15e16315e78]; thanks for the PR, [~adayal]!

Resolved in release 1.35.0 (2023-07-26)
