The goal of the ticket is to check whether or not all SSTables are in the correct location from nodetool. 
[~marcuse] pointed out a more suitable nodetool command to add the check is {{tablestats}}.

PR: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/856/commits/90cfe94fa91c27bc0c09fde1933d2939cf7b1e3a
CI: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/yifan-c/cassandra?branch=C-16344%2Ftrunk

The patch adds a new option, "{{--boundary-check or -B}}", in {{nodetool tablestats}}. When the option is present, it checks if any of the sstable is not in the correct location and display the result/stats in console. 

Thank you for the patch [~yifanc], it looks good to me

-I believe we are missing just doc/help update and it could be committed.-

Not sure whether [~marcuse] also wants to check it as he was involved in the initial discussions.

For the rest of the audience - this ticket is not forbidden. Confirmed on Slack, it is on [~marcuse] list for review, being the leader of the Compaction testing.

+1 - small nit inline on the PR
