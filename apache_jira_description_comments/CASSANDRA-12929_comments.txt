I think the max keep-alive period of 2s is to small and may cause flakiness on unstable test clusters. We should probably increase this to 10s or 30s. 

This is probably a good chance to modify this test to use byteman, so it will be faster since we will not need to load 50k rows.

Hmm, the version check {{CassandraVersion.isSupportedBy}} only consider versions in the same major compatible, so keep-alive was never being enabled. I updated the keep-alive version check to use {{compareTo}} which compares both majors and minors instead, which makes 4.0 compatible with 3.10.

Also updated dtest to use byteman so it will be faster [PR|https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/1458]

Trivial patch attached:

Mind having a quick look [~yukim]? Thanks!

Nice catch. +1.

Submitted [multiplexer run|https://cassci.datastax.com/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized_dtest_multiplexer/391/] since this is a novnode test which did not get triggered in the previous run.

Committed to trunk as {{add855ae177d28d02f1172fb0070ef487237ead5}}. Thanks!

It looks like this is causing quite a few test failures on commit.

In dtests, this includes many tests in sstable_generation_loading_test and snapshot_test.TestSnapshot.test_basic_snapshot_and_restore.

in testall, this includes StreamStateStoreTest.testUpdateAndQueryAvailableRanges, LocalSyncTaskTest.testDifference, StreamingRepairTaskTest.incrementalStreamPlan, StreamingRepairTaskTest.fullStreamPlan, StreamTransferTaskTest.testScheduleTimeout, and StreamTransferTaskTest.testFailSessionDuringTransferShouldNotReleaseReferences.

There may be others that I missed, but that list should get things pointed in the right direction.

My bad, I should have checked more closely.
I pushed fix and submitted test build.

doh, my bad too for not double checking test results and submitting testall (since it was so trivial). I remember we had the exact same problem back in CASSANDRA-11841. :(

Fix and tests look good (triple checked). Committed fix as to trunk as {{633babf0f02fac56cad7bff03a4ff415feb38f39}}. Thanks!

Thanks! It happens.
