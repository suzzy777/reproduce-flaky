I think this must have been fixed somewhere along the way.  I can't get it to fail after many runs, I don't see it [in butler|https://butler.cassandra.apache.org/#/ci/upstream/compare/Cassandra-4.0/cassandra-4.0], and it passes repeated runs [in circle|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/371/workflows/d462e8b9-1fe7-4159-ac41-404246eb47ea/jobs/4219].  I suggest we close.

I think I actually saw it on some branch the other day, let me double check. Anyway I have to check how is butler doing today :) 

Yes, it seems it is flaky on 4.0 https://butler.cassandra.apache.org/#/ci/upstream/workflow/Cassandra-4.0/failure/repair_tests.incremental_repair_test/TestIncRepair/test_multiple_repair

I'm not sure why that doesn't show on the main page, but the few occurrences there are timeouts, and circle passes so I'm not sure there's any surface left to attack.

Agreed. All failures I see on jenkins and are timeouts, which is a well known jenkins issue CASSANDRA-17321. I would close and see if one day we can keep jenkins clean and stable enough these timeouts are actually sthg we can look into. Otherwise whenever I looked they would always be just plain timeouts on an overloaded node.

Checked trunk jenkins history and all is clean. Butler is all green except for a couple occurrences which are all the same as the above: client request timeouts. Which seem prefectly legit on jenkins given it's state and problems. Closing to clear the board for the release.

I still see it in circle

https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/instaclustr/cassandra/1232/workflows/0ee2b67a-28d3-496e-a372-da234292ec41/jobs/5002/tests#failed-test-0

I also saw it today on 4.1

Maybe worth it to be checked at some point as it seems those timeouts consistently pop up here and there only for this test?

One more on trunk: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1929/workflows/f70dd874-0b32-4028-9e9e-40e4f739b436/jobs/15245

And one more time:

Added to the CASSANDRA-17321 bucket list for starters. Do you guys think we should reopen it or is that 'enough'?

I think this one fails pretty consistently in CircleCI, like almost every other time, and the other ticket seems to me to be focused on the Jenkins endless timeouts.

I would advocate to just reopen this one.

In other news, just saw it again, trunk:
