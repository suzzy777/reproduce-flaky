Looks like the test became flaky after we stopped offering unreserved resources beyond quota in https://reviews.apache.org/r/42835. Hence the allocator offers rescinded resources to {{framework1}} if allocation happens before the test finishes, which violates the expectation that {{framework1}} receives resources only once. Since we do not really care about allocations in this test but rather about rescinded resources, a possible fix would be to just ignore subsequent allocations.

    Fixed a flaky test in quota tests.

    The `AvailableResourcesAfterRescinding` test became flaky after we
    stopped offering unreserved resources beyond quota in
    https://reviews.apache.org/r/42835. Hence the allocator offers
    rescinded resources to `framework1` if an allocation happens before
    the test finishes, which violates the expectation that `framework1`
    receives resources only once. Since we do not really care about
    allocations in this test but rather about rescinded resources, the
    fix is just to ignore subsequent offers to `framework1`.
