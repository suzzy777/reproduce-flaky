In the case where a locator starts up and is unable to connect to any other locators, it may decide to become the membership coordinator even if locator-wait-time has not elapsed.

The following conditional from GMSJoinLeave.java causes the issue. There should be an additional check for locator-wait-time before becoming coordinator.

{code:java}
            if (state.joinedMembersContacted <= 0 &&
                (tries >= minimumRetriesBeforeBecomingCoordinator ||
                    state.locatorsContacted >= locators.size())) {
              synchronized (viewInstallationLock) {
                becomeCoordinator();
              }
              return true;
            }
{code}
