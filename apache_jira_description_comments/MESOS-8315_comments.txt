commit 7c6b7d2073454af0641274db18c7d2ac92e581ef

    Fixed a flaky test.
    
    Callbacks of already invalidated instances could be called in
    'ResubscribeResourceProvider' when simulating a resource provider
    restart. This has been resolved by not only restarting a resource
    provider's driver, but by also creating a new 'MockResourceProvider'
    instance.
