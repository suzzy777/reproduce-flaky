rerunFailingTestsCount is not working as expected with junit5 `@ParameterizedTest` 

If 1st iteration of the test passes and the 2nd one fails, it still marks the test as flaky passed. 

Eg: In the following run, iteration 1 with input A passed but iteration 2 with input B failed. Iteration 2 was rerun 2 times and failed in all the attempts. Instead of failing TestA, it's marked as flaky giving an overall pass for the test suite. I believe it's using the Run 1 PASS as a gate to mark the whole test as a pass.
