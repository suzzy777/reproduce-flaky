https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/676440572 for https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/755 also failed due to this.

It's definitely sporadic only and flaky, the test isn't actually just completely broken (that would be easier..), because https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/767 passed after a retry.

One more and I'll propose another Ignore...

This actually appears to be quite frequent, also seen this failure in:

1. https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/676489011 for https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/769

2. https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/676512513 for https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/737 

3. https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/676512599 for https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/771

{quote}If it happens more often, we could @Ignore (like FINERACT-852).

OK so [https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/676392200] for [https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/769] has just failed AGAIN due to this. We know it's most probably NOT caused by a change in that PR, given that the completely trivial [https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/767] had also hit this issue. I'm therefore now proposing [https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/774] for the short term here. (Of course, someone someday needs to make the test more stable again and then remove the Ignore!)

On [https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/676628848] for [https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/774,] the checkPeriodicAccrualAccountingTillCurrentDateFlow () in AccountingScenarioIntegrationTest also :( failed, so I'm proposing an Ignore for that  as well in PR #774 ...

https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/679659779 for https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/782 failed in AccountingScenarioIntegrationTest > checkPeriodicAccrualAccountingFlow so https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/785 proposed to ignore that one as well, based on https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/782.

If we get more than 2 test  methods failing in a test class, then should we just ignore the entire test class instead?

FTR [~npawar] posted some related findings re. this test failure over in FINERACT-850.

[~vorburger] I've been trying to reproduce this locally but have not been able to, so probably something linked to dates again. Not sure how we best get a way to reproduce this... maybe we could re-enable this so we see when it starts failing? 

[~ptuomola] sure, do raise a PR to un-ignore... but note that AccountingScenarioIntegrationTest still uses (the old) schedulerJobHelper.executeJob() instead of our new executeAndAwaitJob() - do you want to switch it over as part of your PR to un-ignore?

[~vorburger] sounds like a plan - I will raise a PR to unignore and switch to executeAndAwaitJob, and will check that this also works with Travis...

[~vorburger] Travis seems to pass with these tests unignored and using executeAndAwaitJob - so this should be ready to be merged...
