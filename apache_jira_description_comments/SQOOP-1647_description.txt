This JIRA proposes to support reading data from an HDFS dataset.

The scope is defined as follows:
Source: Any valid HDFS dataset
Exposed Configuration:
[From] Dataset URI (String, has a validation check)
Workflow:
# KiteFromInitializer will check dataset existence
# Sqoop will create N KiteExtractor instances.
# Every KiteExtractor instance will create a DatasetReader. Records will be read by DatasetReader. Avro data types will be converted to Sqoop expected data types and be written to Sqoop. 
# KiteFromDestroy expect to do nothing.
