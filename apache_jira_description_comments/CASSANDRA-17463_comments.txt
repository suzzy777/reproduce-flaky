The patch for CASSANDRA-17458 seems to fix this failure. The CI runs for that patch successfully run the entire {{SinglePartitionSliceCommandTest}} test suite 1000 times without hitting the failure:

I think we can close this as a duplicate as soon as we commit CASSANDRA-17458.

+1

Seems like we have two committers in agreement here plus it was confirmed we are committing the whole fix in CASSANDRA-17458 so I am close this one as a duplicate in order to clean the board a bit. Thanks [~adelapena]Â  for your work!
