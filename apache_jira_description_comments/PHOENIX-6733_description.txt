In pretty much every recent Yetus test run, some tests have flapped in the AfterClass teardown logic which tries to check for HBase Store reference resource leaks. The error message is "Ref count leaked", and some common suites this happens to are:
DateTimeIT
InListIT
SequenceIT
IndexToolForDeleteBeforeRebuildIT
SpooledTmpFileDeleteIT

I haven't had much luck trying to reproduce this locally. It's also not clear yet whether the root cause is an HBase error or a Phoenix one. (And if it's a Phoenix one, is the bug with something in Phoenix or with the resource check?)
