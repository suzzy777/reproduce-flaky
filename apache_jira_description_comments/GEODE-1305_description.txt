Currently the DUnit tests fork every 30 test classes in order to avoid potential OOME or unnecessary GC pauses. Yet, unnecessary GCs still cause some tests to be marked as "flaky".
In order reproduce this flaky behaviour, tests can be run until they fail. Which mostly occurs due to the test not cleaning up after itself.

The "fork 30" functionality should be replicated in the test code, as running a single test/test class, eventually causes it to fail, due to GC issues.

Ideally the VMs should be bounced after every test. But due to increased test times, this might be increased to bounce the VMs after a certain amount of tests rather the test classes as gradle script currently does.
