Implement native .NET Near Cache, which stores deserialized cache data on CLR heap.

Right now every cache.Get, every scan query, etc, cause repeated copy and deserialization of data from JVM, even for primary keys or near cache entries. This often becomes a bottleneck. Keeping up-to-date deserialized values in CLR memory can greatly improve performance and reduce latency.
