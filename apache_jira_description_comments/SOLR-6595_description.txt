Followed the description https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Enabling+SSL and generated a self signed key pair. Configured a few solr-nodes and used the collection api to crate a new collection. -I get error message when specify the nodes with the createNodeSet param. When I don't use createNodeSet param the collection gets created without error on random nodes. Could this be a bug related to the createNodeSet param?- *Update: It failed due to what turned out to be invalid client certificate on the overseer, and returned the following response:*

{code:xml}
<response>
  <lst name="responseHeader"><int name="status">0</int><int name="QTime">185</int></lst>
  <lst name="failure">
    <str>org.apache.solr.client.solrj.SolrServerException:IOException occured when talking to server at: https://vt-searchln04:443/solr</str>
  </lst>
</response>
{code}

*Update: Three problems:*
# Status=0 when the cmd did not succeed (only ZK was updated, but cores not created due to failing to connect to shard nodes to talk to core admin API).
# The error printed does not tell which action failed. Would be helpful to either get the msg from the original exception or at least some message saying "Failed to create core, see log on Overseer <node.name>
# State of collection is not clean since it exists as far as ZK is concerned but cores not created. Thus retrying the CREATECOLLECTION cmd would fail. Should Overseer detect error in distributed cmds and rollback changes already made in ZK?
