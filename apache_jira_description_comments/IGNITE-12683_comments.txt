[TeamCity *--&gt; Run :: All* Results|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=5065881&amp;buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll]

I did 360 runs on TC with an extended timeout - no failures (see [CHANGES|https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/7436/files], [RESULTS|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Pds1&tab=buildTypeHistoryList&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F7436%2Fhead]).
Therefore, to fix failures, I increased the timeout to 10 minutes and applied a scale factor for the number of keys (to speed up regular execution).

Hello [~Pavlukhin],
could you take a look at this small patch?

[~xtern], thank you for contribution! Merged to master.
