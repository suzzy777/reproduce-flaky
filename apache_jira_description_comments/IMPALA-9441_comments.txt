I think this is probably a bug in doGetDbsMetadata() where it's calling getDbs() then callling another method like getDbs() using the database name, but in the meantime the database was dropped.

[~vihangk1] [~stigahuang] fyi. Not sure if this is catalog-v2 specific (since this was in the dockerised tests)
