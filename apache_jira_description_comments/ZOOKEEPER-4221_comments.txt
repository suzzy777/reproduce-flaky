the Len error not necessarily means jute.maxbuffer size problem. If ZooKeeper gets a "malformed" message (not even a jute message), then the first few bytes (encoding "len") can be anything. Maybe an error message like this one would make more sense:

"Len error, the first few bytes of the message contains invalid value: 1048648. This is either a message too large to process (see parameter jute.maxbuffer.size) or this is a malformed message."

I agree. This would make more sense. Also, I would like to also add the configured jute.maxbuffer current value in the message as well as the source-ip address.
Something like :

"Len error, the first few bytes of the message contains invalid value: 1048648. This is either a message too large to process (current parameter jute.maxbuffer=1048575) or this is a malformed message. origin=/127.0.0.1:51775"
