So i have written this simple script (attached) which looks at history of the [post commit build|https://builds.apache.org/view/All/job/HBase-Trunk_matrix] and outputs a list of flaky tests with some numbers.

Next steps:
1. Setup a jenkins job (say *find-flaky-tests*) to run this script daily. We can either directly pull these results into other jobs using curl on this job's artifacts, or commit the list of flaky test to repo (idk if it's possible to commit something from jenkins job).
We'll collect results from both *post-commit* job (to add new flakies) and *flaky-tests* job (to delete tests which are no more flaky).

2. Change *pre-commit* and *post-commit* jobs to ignore these tests using --exclude maven flag. Someone familiar with yetus might be able to do it easily.

3. Setup a new job (say *flaky-tests*) to run only these flaky tests.
