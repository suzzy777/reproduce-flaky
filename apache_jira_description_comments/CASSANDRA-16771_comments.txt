This is just a plain timeout. The traceback doesn't pin down which exact test case failed but there is only one candidate {{testMessageMatching}} as it's the only one issuing a {{SELECT}} that shouldn't fail. Seems like a reasonable guess despite the other test case with {{SELECT}}

It can be reproduced by placing a breakpoint [here|https://github.com/bereng/cassandra/blob/CASSANDRA-16771-4.0.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/service/reads/ReadCallback.java#L101]. The solution is to raise the timeout for this test and now it survives a 1K CI run.

LGTM, thanks
