One word of caution.

It might not be worth setting tests to run in parallel.

I know even today there are issues with running two tests in parallel (If they generate the same job name, and run concurrently, they will fail on the dataflow runner)
The workflow could not be created. Causes: (a8f47b4f3654731d): There is already an active job named beamapp-jenkins-0728180349-027689. If you want to submit a second job, try again by setting a different name.",

> Note: This does not mean that we should ignore flakey tests, which are sometimes indicative of bugs. We should continue to investigate those with a continuous test suite.

There is a high likelihood that follow up investigation won't be happening if automatic retries are enabled, so i'd be cautious with this until we have the system to investigate and eliminate flakes that works.

Since the same tests run in postcommit, if they flake in postcommit, they will fail frequently (We won't rerun them in postcommit). The follow up investigation should happen as part of that process, for rotational duties and those monitoring postcommit tests.

The whole point of this Jira is to make submitting code smoother. We frequently have situations where you are blocked from submitting code because there are too many flakey tests. "Retest this please" will then run all the tests again, even those which passed, and cause different flakey tests to fail. What we really want is a way to run only the failed tests again.

Yes, we should address flakey tests

No, they shouldn't be a pain point for every person trying to submit a PR. We should try to remove that pain point

I don't buy the argument that we won't follow up on flakey tests, unless we make them a pain point for everyone trying to commit PRs.

This Jira ticket has a pull request attached to it, but is still open. Did the pull request resolve the issue? If so, could you please mark it resolved? This will help the project have a clear view of its open issues.

The PR is still in progress

It might be possible to re-enable this plugin by keeping smaller number of past builds. (probably not a good outcome)
