The Oozie purge process for bundles is creating orphan coordinators. When purging bundle jobs and bundle actions, it does not always purge coordinator jobs, etc. This causes orphaned coordinators, meaning neither they nor their children will ever be purged due to the purge logic.

 
----
 

When purging bundles, it first compiles a list of any coordinators which are not ready to purge [0]. It checks the coord list for status and coordOlderThan. If the no child coordinator meets these criteria, it adds it to the coordsToPurge list.

Being added to the list does not guarantee that the coordinator will be purged however. The processCoordinators method also has logic to check if the children workflows are older than wfOlderThan [1]. If a purge command is started where wfOlderThan is much higher than coordOlderThan (for example the default values are 30 days for workflows and 7 days for coordinators), then the bundle will be purged, but the coordinator will not.

Since the bundle is now purged, the child coordinator will never be purged because only parentless coordinators will be checked, since coordinators with parents will only be purged when the bundle is purged
