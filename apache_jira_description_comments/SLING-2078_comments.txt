The dif

patch isn't backwards compatible. just because SNS are allowed doesn't mean they're intended. I'd be open to applying a patch to enable this behavior if specifically requested (i.e. if some request parameter was present).

There is already a parameter :replace on the operation. And only if this is true, the node should be replaced. 
However the implementation of that parameter in the parent class seems to be a bit flaky as it is not used if a node is moved to a "/" location!

For me that seems to be a bug in its own but I don't want to modify the code as I don't know why it is implemented the way it is and the intention of it and no unit tests are given.
Also the code is used as parent for copy and move which makes it even more dangerous to modify it.



Postponing to next release as we don't seem to have a clear resolution so far

Removing from release schedule as we still don't have consensus
