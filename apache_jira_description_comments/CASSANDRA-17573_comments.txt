marking 4.1 to be addressed before we release 4.1 (can't release with flaky tests)

I don't see it in Butler, but managed to reproduce it in CircleCI [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=17573-4.1&filter=all] - fails 4-5% of the time with MIDRES.

I ran in a loop the test class with the patch where it was introduced and it seems that it was a bit flaky from the very beginning - CASSANDRA-17164, CEP-14, Paxos Improvements

[~benedict] , [~bdeggleston] , [~ifesdjeen] , [~samt] , [~aleksey], can anyone of you, please, look into it?

So I don't _think_ this was one of my tests, but I can't recall for sure.

I suspect the problem is Gossip propagating the version data around the cluster. I'm not actually certain why we're enabling network and gossip here at all, to be honest, which might be a simple fix.

[~bdeggleston] do you remember this test?

Ok, looking at it more closely, the issue is that the release version is replicated by Paxos electorate verification (not sure why, haven't looked closely). So if we set the release version on every node the problem resolves. I will post a patch shortly.

Triaging the 4.1 blockers board and stumbled into this one. I think we need also a 4.1 patch. 

Can we also run again the test in a loop in order to confirm that it is not flaky anymore?

Please feel free to cherry-pick [this commit|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commit/8a9f13b6d6601c2a0d48f29f6829cf6ab23054e7] which includes the Circle config I used to run it in a loop to reproduce it before. 

The following command was used to generate the config:
{code:java}
.circleci/generate.sh -m -e  REPEATED_UTEST_TARGET=test-jvm-dtest-some -e REPEATED_UTEST_CLASS=org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.PaxosRepairTest  -e REPEATED_DTEST_COUNT=500{code}

This is one of our last blockers and I had some cycles today so pushed to test on 4.1 and trunk the patch (the test in a loop using the config mentioned in my previous comment):
[4.1|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=17573-4.1-test]

[trunk|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=17573-trunk-test]

Happy to report it is all green, you might want to commit it if nothing new popped up since the patch was created

[~benedict] in the interest of moving 4.1 closer to release, would you like this committed if you are short on time?

Committed into 4.1 at 49cd4b5f79e4cda16668cce8aea7d93d480f48fc and merged into trunk
