The test assumes that when the same query calls the second time, the storage Loading does not happen. From the failure tests, it seems it is not the case. The loading is triggered although it took 0 seconds. Does your change related to catalog V2, or are there any V2 changes recently? 

[~ychena] this is the change - it really doesn't touch anything metadata related: https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/14344/

IMPALA-9022: Fixed test_query_profile_storage_load_time_filesystem

Skip part of the test which can be affected by the random behavor
of Catalog V2. The major purpose of the test is to verify storage
load time can be in query profile when metadata loading happens,
which is not affected by the change.
