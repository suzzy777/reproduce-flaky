Initial patch available [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/271]

This introduces two internal classes: {{ReplicaList}} and {{ReplicaMap}} that permit more efficient implementation of {{AbstractReplicaCollection}}.  It also introduces a {{filterLazily}} method, and cleans up the caching (and use thereof) of transient/full sub collections in {{RangesAtEndpoint}}.

I'm also open to introducing any {{anyMatch}} and {{allMatch}} if people think it's a good idea.

It may be that this change is seen as unnecessary, but since these classes are all new, introducing these optimisations now seems like probably the best course of action.  I will follow up with some extra tests, though the new classes are *mostly* covered already through the existing tests.

I think getting this into 4.0 would reduce the differences between 4.0 and 4.next and that makes it worth it in terms of avoiding future merge pain.

+1,

I have found only one tiny problem in tests [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/271#discussion-diff-220871785R173]. All other comments are nits.

Regarding tests themselves, I'm usually trying to make non-generic tests (e.g. write hardcoded asserts rather than comparing outputs of functions), since they're easier to read for reviewers. Not saying we should get rid of the ones that are already there, but maybe we could at least add a comment or open a jira to write some more "hardcoded" tests.

Thanks for the review.  I've committed as [e645b9172c5d50fc2af407de724e46121edfe109|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/e645b9172c5d50fc2af407de724e46121edfe109].  

dtests are now very flaky on CircleCI, but all of the failures in the latest run have shown up in trunk runs for me on CircleCI.

As to tests, it's interesting that you find hard-coded tests to be easier to read.  I personally find the opposite.  However, I'm happy to file a follow-up JIRA to further expand the testing; I'll follow up with that in the near future.
