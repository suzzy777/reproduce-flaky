This is the first time I've seen this in at least a year. Flagging the test as flaky may be premature. Can we see more detail on the failure?

Ah, I see a patch was added. Is this a JDK7 thing?

testScannerResultCodes must run after testGzipFilter. Since there is no good way to specify the execution order, I re-order the test code a little.

Yes, that's right.  It is related to jdk7.

Thanks for reviewing it.  I updated the title to be clear.
