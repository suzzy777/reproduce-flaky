Currently we use default timeouts in CQL driver (used in CQLTester) which is 5 seconds for connection and 12 seconds for read. This is ok in most cases. However when running tests using infrastructure which is not very stable, it may happen those timeouts are insufficient in rare cases and the builds result in flakiness.

I'd like to either increase those timeouts or make them configurable
