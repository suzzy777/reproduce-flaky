I will take this on.Â 

Thanks [~lkokhreidze]!

Hello [~lkokhreidze], are you still actively working on this flaky test?

[~lkokhreidze] ping again, please let me know if you are still working on it.

I've re-tested this case locally with 5+ times, each with 50 runs, and identified it is a flakiness by itself, not a real bug. The fix is summarized in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12468.

On a side note, I think it's an overkill to really introduce the whole test class as an integration test, since all we need is to just test the assignor itself which could be a unit test. Running this suite with 9+ instances takes long time and is still vulnerable to all kinds of timing based flakiness (yes this PR alone cannot guarantee we've avoided all). So I will file a separate ticket for reducing this test into unit tests.
