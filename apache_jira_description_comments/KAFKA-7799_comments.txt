Going to go ahead and pick this up since I think I know the problem. Basically the dependence on the system property is a bit brittle and relies on the order of execution of the tests.

URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6106
 
 
   The test fails 100% of the time if `testOptionsDoesNotIncludeWadlOutput` is executed before `testCORSEnabled`. It seems the problem is the use of the system property. Perhaps there is some static caching somewhere.

This test is failing frequently on Jenkins builds. Reopening.

avocader commented on pull request #6236: KAFKA-7799: Abstract HttpClient to allow sending restricted headers.
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6236
 
 
   The test `org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.rest.RestServerTest#testCORSEnabled` assumes Jersey client can send restricted HTTP headers(`Origin`).
   
   Jersey client uses `sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection`.
   `sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection` filters out restricted headers("Host", "Keep-Alive", "Origin", etc) based on static property `allowRestrictedHeaders`.
   This property is initialized in a static block by reading Java system property `sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders`.
   
   So, if classloader loads `HttpURLConnection` before we set `sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders=true`, then all subsequent changes of this system property won't take any effect(which happens if `org.apache.kafka.connect.integration.ExampleConnectIntegrationTest` is executed before `RestServerTest`).
   To prevent this, we have to make sure we set `sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders=true` as early as possible.
   
   This PR abstracts all HTTP calls to `org.apache.kafka.connect.util.clients.HttpClient`, which should be used in tests for HTTP in order to not interfere with `RestServerTest` and restricts imports of all HTTP-related packages in favor of enforcing to use the new client.

   This PR adds test dependency on `httpcomponents-client` which doesn't depend on `sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders` system property. Thus none of existing tests should interfere with `RestServerTest`.
