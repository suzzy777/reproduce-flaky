CC [~brandonwilliams], I think he had some reasons for not running it in CI. If I remember correctly,, too many false positives that break the builds or so. But I guess we can add some separate job that can run now and then and report in case of failures so someone can open tickets, etc. Separate from the regular post-commit pipeline.

Yes [~e.dimitrova], it is the way how we should implement it - we will get a junit report rather than a failed build and, as suggested by [~mmuzaf], we can treat failures as we do for flakies today.

bq. we can treat failures as we do for flakies today.
Not sure what this means

Look, suppose you have a ticket, you run the pre-commit workflow and you find that some job has failed because of some test failures. You recognize them as flaky and unrelated to your ticket. You either find a ticket for that flaky test or create a new one and you can move forward. 

We expect a similar scenario for OWASP check. Dependency check would not prevent building artifacts - it will be a separate job where each discovered dependency is shown as a failed unit test case. That job would be run independently of the other tests. Now, you find it detected a failure for some dependency. If you didn't add that dependency in your branch, it means that a new CVE got published and you need to:
- create a ticket for fix that CVE
- add suppression with a comment pointing to the ticket
and you can move forward.

Does that sound like a reasonable procedure?

Thanks for the detailed explanation. Sounds reasonable to me, as long as we do not burn ourselves with plenty of false alarms on every commit. 

Looking at the current list of suppression, we should not be

bq. add suppression with a comment pointing to the ticket

Please don't paper over the problem like this, just reference the ticket in your CI run as you would an existing flaky.

I agree with Brandon Williams; I missed the suppression part while reading the explanation, sorry about that. I am also against suppressing failing tests or failing alerts. That is a recipe to forget about them. 

I don't have a strong opinion on that.
