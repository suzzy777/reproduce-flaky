It would be great if we had an ad-hoc job that could run a given test a bunch of times and tell me if it is flaky.

I'm trying to evaluate the state of our new nightly jobs, and I'm not sure if hte failures I'm seeing are a) things I need to get fixed soon, b) things that are flaky but previously unrecognized, c) things that are flaky but missed because our current flaky list is only based on the behavior of the master branch.
