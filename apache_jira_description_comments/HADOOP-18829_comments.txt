   @mehakmeet @mukund-thakur this one is one of the follow-ups from HADOOP-18291, could you please review this PR?




can i get my /HADOOP-18184 unbuffer patch in before anything else? i've already had to rebase it a couple of times.

sure thing, i think this can wait for sure. thanks

   this (and other future follow-ups from HADOOP-18291) can go after #5832

Review Comment:
   sounds good, since the eventually() throws last exception (which comes from assertj library, they are not taking any error msg as argument), let me add comments on this.
   we don't see flakiness as such but 4 is good enough based on multiple rounds of tests that i did last week.

   > please don't rebase to trunk in the middle of a review, It makes reviewing changes a bit difficult unless there are merge conflicts we should have a consistent base for all commits stacked on top of each other.
   
   sure, for this PR, since i just wanted to run the whole test suite with latest head from trunk, i did the merge from latest trunk but maybe i can find other way of re-running the test suite on latest trunk (by manually applying patch on latest trunk, only locally) :)

Review Comment:
   Sure, let's not worry about it then, I was thinking more of adding the error message to the assertion itself rather than the eventually() block. It's always tricky with multi-threaded tests with falkiness.
