This issue has been introduced with [https://reviews.apache.org/r/64098/] patch.
The master [sends a task status update|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/fabf2edc83eae6b32048e22edc18fe4d8738dbe1/src/master/master.cpp#L7095-L7120] on [agent's re-registration|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/fabf2edc83eae6b32048e22edc18fe4d8738dbe1/src/tests/reconciliation_tests.cpp#L1113-L1116] after starting a new master. Hence, `ReconcileStatusUpdateTaskState` [might detect|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/fabf2edc83eae6b32048e22edc18fe4d8738dbe1/src/tests/reconciliation_tests.cpp#L1118-L1122] the latest task status update, which is `TASK_FINISHED`.
Perhaps, there are more flaky tests caused by the same issue.

This test failed because we didn't enable replicated log registry so the master doesn't know the agent when it reregisters. With MESOS-6406 the intention was not to send status updates actively when it is a known agent.

However the discussions about this test exposed a bug that we are not sending the "status update state" in this case, for which I filed MESOS-8824 and will fix next.

    Fixed flaky ReconciliationTest.ReconcileStatusUpdateTaskState.
    
    To simulate a master failover we need to use `replicated_log` as the
    registry otherwise the master loses persisted info about the agents.
