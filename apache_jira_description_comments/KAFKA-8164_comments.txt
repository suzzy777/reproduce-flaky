viktorsomogyi commented on pull request #6506: KAFKA-8164: Add unitTestWithFlakyRetry and testWithFlakyRetry tasks
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6506
 
 
   These tasks run the tests and collect failures without failing the build. Failed tests are run again in a second turn and the build is failed only if there are test failures in this second run.
