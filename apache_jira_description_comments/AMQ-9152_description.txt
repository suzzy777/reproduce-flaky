There is an include filter in the pom for activemq-unit-tests that is preventing all tests from running. It's only running tests that end in "Test" so it won't run things like "AdvisoryTests" since there is an s at the end. After changing this I already found one failing test in AdvisoryTests and there will probably be others so once we see what breaks we will need to go fix the tests or ignore them for now and then add a Jira to fix them later as they have likely been broken for a long time.
