Seeing this once every month or two in-house. Looks like it's a timing-based test, which makes it prone to flakiness, but I've noticed that whenever it fails, it fails with the same {{AssertionError}} (including values), so it'd be worth digging into. In our case:
{noformat}
expected:<1000> but was:<999>

Stack Trace:
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<1000> but was:<999>
