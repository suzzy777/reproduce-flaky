I want to be able to interact with the cluster without having to be on the cluster in order to effect the configuration. Either as a developer, I want to develop code in my IDE and as part of developing that code, I need to create regions. Or as a data operator, I need to perform configurations on the cluster and I want to interact with the cluster.

 

As a Developer
I want to create a region in the cluster using the JAVA API on the cluster
when I am not located on the cluster (I do not need to be be on a node on the cluster)
when I am authenticated and authorized for create region
So that  a region is created on the cluster
So that I can put and get data in that region
