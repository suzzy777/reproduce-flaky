There were two issues I fixed in [^PIG-5284.0.patch] both of them inside {{InterRecordReader#skipUntilMarkerOrSplitEndOrEOF}}

One is that we were using 0 as default value of {{int b}} which is a valid first byte for a sync marker. I've set this now to Integer.MIN_VALUE. Without this we may end up having the same records appearing multiple times in the output.

The other problem was the handling of sync markers on split beginnings: when the next sync marker is exactly at the next split's beginning and the last byte before (in the previous data/record) is the same as the first byte of the marker we will read past the split end instead of stopping. This also results in same records appearing multiple times in the output.

[~rohini], [~nkollar] let me know what you think please

Thanks for reviewing so quickly [~rohini]! Committed to trunk.
