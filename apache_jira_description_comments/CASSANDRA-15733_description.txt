Currently the builder is rather heavy and creates configs plus call the factory with specific fields only, this isnâ€™t that flexible and makes it harder to have custom cluster definitions which require additional fields to be defined.  To solve this we should make the builder be sent to the factory and expose the state so the factory can get all the fields it needs, the factory should also be in charge of creating the configs
