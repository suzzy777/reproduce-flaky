When building against Hadoop 3.3.3 and any future version of Hadoop incorporating reload4j, the new Enforcer rule we have active in branch-2.5 and up to exclude other logging frameworks besides log4j2 will trigger. We need to add exclusions to prevent that from happening so the build will succeed.

Tested with {{mvn clean install assembly:single -DskipTests -Dhadoop-three.version=3.3.3}} on master branch and with {{mvn clean install assembly:single -DskipTests -Dhadoop.profile=3.0 -Dhadoop-three.version=3.3.3}} on branch-2.5. 

I also needed to exclude leveldbjni-all via hadoop-hdfs to avoid a LICENSE file generation error. hadoop-hdfs is messy and exports this among findbugs and other clutter. Anyway, better to exclude something we do not require than add an unnecessary supplemental model.
