I admit I wasn't able to reproduce this when I set my system locale to de_DE, and I was able to get a failure when I changed the setLocales to de_DE.  I am NOT doubting that you experienced this, [~tilman]! :D


I read on SO that there may be flaky threadlocals involved with Locales in junit tests.  I changed the code to reset to en_US after every test.

Please let me know if this now works.

Doesn't work but you made the change in main, not in 2.0, which is what I tested.

The problem doesn't occur in main at all (I reverted the change just to be sure).

Ha. Ok. {{main}} is the development branch for 2.x. 2.x is the original draft by Bob Paulin. Let’s rename that branch.

Or, did you get this failure on the 2.0.0-BETA tag/src?

Yes. I thought that was the branch for the 2.0 release.

You can close the issue. The test mentioned works in the 2.0.0 beta (another test fails, but doesn't in main, so it's probably been fixed).

Thank you [~tilman]!
