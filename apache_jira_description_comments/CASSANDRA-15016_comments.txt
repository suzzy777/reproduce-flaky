Fixed this issue by adding {{compatibility_flag}} to test_simple_bootstrap_mixed_versions. This adds {{cassandra.force_3_0_protocol_version}} flag to the new bootstrapping node beforing joining the cluster.

Here are the updated dtest and upgrade tests run with that branch

Can you better document what is going on and why the compatibility flag is being set in the tests so the next person knows what is going on?

Thank you for the review [~aweisberg]

[assert_almost_equal |https://github.com/vinaykumarchella/cassandra-dtest/commit/adcc84d71de6f727d05647b21ff6c48d7bf6920b#diff-0b30b9f097df89d74be1d1af8205ac7eL115] is flaky across the versions. I tried to change this to achieve a more fine-grained size check. Context: this [check|https://github.com/vinaykumarchella/cassandra-dtest/commit/adcc84d71de6f727d05647b21ff6c48d7bf6920b#diff-0b30b9f097df89d74be1d1af8205ac7eL115] is to ensure that cleanup and compact did their job, but we end up checking the entire node size which might be varying as additional tables that we *may* introduce in new releases or already introduced ones from across the versions. We also don't put in enough data to make that the dominant cost for test keyspaces.

Based on our offline discussion and suggestions, I added table specific data size check, and this enables to do data size check for tables that we are interested in, with this change now we achieve our goal of size checking without depending on external factors of system tables and their size.

I made this better now, instead of exposing it as a {{compatibility_flag_on}}, now passing {{bootstrap}} function with compatibility_flag, this makes the better use of [bootstrap|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/master/bootstrap_test.py#L46] parameter in {{_base_bootstrap_test}}

I tried to add context in code and also referenced CASSANDRA-13004 in comments.

+1 looks good. Thanks for fixing this.
