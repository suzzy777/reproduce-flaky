I have also added an extra patch for CassandraSessionImpl which I believe should be a warning rather than an error - this is due to the fact that when the exception occurs is throw it will get retried by GridCacheWriteBehindStore::updateStore and therefore it is not strictly an "error". But I am happy to restore it if we have decided that it should be an error.

[~sunnychanclsa] I took the liberty to also convert Cassandra warning to Log Throttle, and check INCLUDE_SENSITIVE in cache store's message.
