Nice catch again [~zuston]. +1 pending jenkins. Unfortunately the precommit does not pick up the pull requests so could you please also upload the patch here.

(We do have a Jira about the pull request support, but there were not much progress there: OOZIE-3479).

Of course.~

I think github pull request will be more convenient code review. Maybe need to change jenkins configuration to support pull request

[~zuston] Thanks for uploading the patch. Could you please also press the submit patch button to trigger the precommit. (Usually I can see the button, but right now it's missing for me, maybe because of the in-progress status, or the pull-request).

Yes, pull requests are much more convenient. Precommit downloads the patch from Jira using using [this code|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/bin/test-patch#L244], maybe we could enhance it to also download pull request from github.
