This is failing to hit a memory exceeded on the last two core runs:
{noformat}
query_test/test_mem_usage_scaling.py:386: in test_exchange_mem_usage_scaling
    self.run_test_case('QueryTest/exchange-mem-scaling', vector)
common/impala_test_suite.py:482: in run_test_case
    assert False, "Expected exception: %s" % expected_str
E   AssertionError: Expected exception: Memory limit exceeded{noformat}
It might be that the limit needs to be adjusted. 

There were two changes since the last successful run: IMPALA-7367 (2a4835cfba7597362cc1e72e21315868c5c75d0a) and IMPALA-5031 (53ce6bb571cd9ae07ba5255197d35aa852a6f97c)
