When opening a Job DAG when the job is still in progress, the DAG is OK, but when the job will finish, this diagram is not refreshed.

Steps to reproduce: 
- submit a workflow (e.g. the subwf from the examples) - the wf should not end very quickly, to have time to catch it when it is still running
- check the Job DAG when the job is still running
- wait for the job to finish
- check again the Job DAG -> is the same with the running one

Note: if check it in a new tab, is OK, and also a browser refresh will solve it.
