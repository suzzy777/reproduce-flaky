    IGNITE-8266: remove stopAllGrids for cache pkg

----


[~NIzhikov],

Changes ready for review. Can you look at them?
 In this PR we are removing all boilerplate code related to stopAllGrids by default.

TC looks good: 
 [#1337 (20 Apr 18 17:43)|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1230464] – javadoc broken, but not through my changes
 [#1346 (21 Apr 18 04:20)|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1232781] – next build javadoc is OK

[~Mmuzaf]

I want to make code as clear as it can be.
So, please, remove also calls of {{super.afterAllTests()}} whenever it can be done.

[~NIzhikov] can we remove after tests in separate issue?

 

Ideally I would suggest migration to JUnit4 instead of too much efforts in old JUnit3 tests, so IMO we can review PR and merge as is.

[~dpavlov]

> can we remove after tests in separate issue?

In my opinion, we should do as few refactorings as we can.
So I still propose to remove {{super.afterAllTests()}}.

But, if you have another opinion, please proceed with the review and merge.

[~NIzhikov], according to my feeling of "Apache way", we should come to an agreement here and only then apply the patch.

 

 I suggest to move deletion of super.afterTestsStopped() out of scope by 2 reasons..
 # First of all after applying patch without such removal less test will start to fail. Clean up after test may cause flaky failures, so I prefer to move by smaller steps. It will be easier to identify failure reason.
 # afterTestsStopped() may now contain no-op code, but some time later, base class may be changed, so new base class will require additional cleanup. E.g. non persistence Ignite test can be transformed to persistence enabled, so call to super would become reasonable. Same for system options setupa and cleanup. System option which was forgotten to be reset can cause a number of non-intuitive flaky failures.

 

I, of course , can proceed with review, but would like to enlist your support in final solution.

[~NIzhikov], [~dpavlov]

As we've discussed privately I've removed super.afterTestsStopped() call which lead to empty implementation and prepeared whole PR to review.


 Also, I've made new Run::All() build: 
[https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1292078&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll]

[~Mmuzaf] Looks good to me. Let's merge it, already!

[~NIzhikov] would you merge?

[~Mmuzaf] Please, execute Run All to get exection without timeouts.
Le'ts make sure we on the safe side.

[~dpavlov] Yes. After we get mergeable Run All results.

[~NIzhikov], [~dpavlov]

I agree with you that {{Run::All()}} is very improtant for this PR, but I can't get build without exectution timeouts (they are not due to my changes). Note, I've got 3 runs and each of it have different failed suites:
 [#1637 (15 May 18 09:14)|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1292078&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll]
 [#1657 (15 May 18 22:22)|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1295665&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll]
 [#1664 (16 May 18 03:32)|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1296343&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll]
 I've merged changes from master got Run::All() and tests fails with OOM errors (not due to my changes):
 [#1674 (16 May 18 16:32)|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1299144&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll]

Can we merge this chagnes based on all this TC runs? I think at the current point of time we have no chance to get ideal Run::All build.

New Run:All and again with execution timeouts (they are also persists in master branch):
[#1683 (16 May 18 21:26)|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1300389&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll]

Test failures occurred in Run All does not indicate that something was broken by this change.

In the same time I also confused by the number of timeouts in Cache 6 , Hadoop, and IGFS suites.

Could we double check if there is no dangerous changes in these suites related tests?

I've attached screenshot with graphical interpretation of failures, black is timeout and red is test failure, green - suite passed

!screenshot-1.png!


Folks,

This Run:All looks much better – [#1706 (17 May 18 17:10)|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1304850&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll]
Since timeouts in Cache 6 Suite is a known issue -- [IGNITE-8509|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-8509].

Yes, my picture illustrates history of all runs, each vertical line is 1 run.

Last run may be better than previous because of randomized nature of failure.

[~Mmuzaf], [~dpavlov] Looks good to me. I think these changes are ready to be merged.

Last TC Run :: All

[#1759 (21 May 18 10:32)|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1315970&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll]

Merged to master.

[~Mmuzaf] Thanks for the contribution.
