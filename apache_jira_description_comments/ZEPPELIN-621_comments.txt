    Switch to Java 8

    ### What is this PR for?
    Java 7 is now officially no longer supported by Oracle and Java 8 has been released quite a while. We should take the opportunity to switch to Java 8.
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    [Improvement]
    
    ### Todos
    * [ ] - Task
    
    ### Is there a relevant Jira issue?
    **[ZEPPELIN-621]**
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    * Build Zeppelin with `mvn clean -Pxxxx -DskipTests`
    * Create some notes with spark/angular/shell interpreter and test some basic use-case
    
    This PR is low risk because Java 8 is backward-compatible with Java 7 source code.
    
    ### Screenshots (if appropriate)
    N/A
    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update? --> No
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? --> No
    * Does this needs documentation? --> No

We need to re-consider this decision - Spark starting with 2.2.0 depends on Java 8 only, and Zeppelin's master depends on 2.2.0...

From Spark's release notes: "Note that support for Java 7, Python 2.6 and old Hadoop versions before 2.6.5 were removed as of Spark 2.2.0."

This issue was closed more than year ago.

We need to reconsider this again - we already have dependency (Spark 2.2.0) that requires Java 8+

    We also need to update .travis.yml to use only java 8


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    I have a simple question. Is `Vargrant` related to JDK8 directly?


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3029
  
    @alexott Travis fails, could you help check that ? 


Github user alexott commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3029
  
    @jongyoul JDK is configured there as well, so I was going to change it everywhere, so people who develop using Vagrant, won't get problems...


Github user alexott commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3029
  
    @zjffdu I forgot to enable CI, and test is now running, although some tests are failed - will investigate over weekend...


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3029
  
    You need to first rebase your PR ( I disable some flaky test recently). 


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3029
  
    @alexott  The last build in travis fails, could you rerun it ?


Github user alexott commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3029
  
    Ok, it looks like it's working now, but really not sure what was wrong with configuration...


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3029
  
    There's still some flaky test that may fails due to networks issue or other issues. 
    LGTM
