It is a performance test. And these are the notices to make sure what the real numbers are.

It has nothing to do with functional test as you have supposed to.

It's exactly the problem. It's performance test which measure numbers on a machine.

And they are machine dependant. To run performance test you must ensure the node running those can handle it.

In case of a poor performance machine or overloaded node, the test will fail whereas it's part of the default build.

Such test cannot be part of the default build.Â 

Agreed this should not be part of the standard suite. Where should we move it?
