    [ZEPPELIN-1828] Flaky Test: RemoteInterpreterTest hanged in zeppelin-interpreter

    ### What is this PR for?
    When `interpreter.close()` occurs in code it shuts down _RemoteInterpreterEventPoller_ and then tries to close thrift connection. While closing thrift client will wait until events queue is empty. If _RemoteInterpreterEventPoller_ has not processed all thrift events before the shutdown signal comes, thrift client will wait forever. As a result Travis will terminate the build after code is not responding for 10 minutes.
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    [Bug Fix]
    
    ### Todos
    We need to:
    * [ ] - write a test that checks that event queue is empty after _RemoteInterpreterEventPoller_ is done,
    * [ ] - clear unread events on _RemoteInterpreterEventPoller_ shutdown signal.
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    [ZEPPELIN-1828](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1828)
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    This issue can be reprodused if you put `Thread.sleep(3000L);` to  _RemoteInterpreterEventPoller.java_ 
    ```
    ...
    } else if (event.getType() == RemoteInterpreterEventType.OUTPUT_UPDATE_ALL) {
        Thread.sleep(3000L);
        ...
    }
    ```
    and run _RemoteInterpreterTest.java_.
    
    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update? **no**
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? **no**
    * Does this needs documentation? **no**
