For example, if a script like this is run:
{code}
select 1;
select 1;
select 1;
select 1;
select 1;
select sleep(30000);
{code}

The queries are not actually closed until the session disconnects. This causes major problems with admission control because queries start to get rejected because they are still in-flight.
