Any particular reason, why this is assigned to me? 

The last time this error happened, in May 22, it was also assigned to you. I think it is lzo-related. Mind taking a look and reassigning? 

[~mgrund_impala_bb91] or [~ippokratis] - can one of you decide whether this is a critical bug we should fix for 2.3.0?

We have seen this error happening twice since May. I think we should keep an eye on it, but not put it in the list of critical bugs for 2.3.
 

I was able to reproduce this: I had an old snapshot loaded and was able to get the same error, after loading the current snapshot, the error went away. 

My assumption is that this error occurred with an old snapshot loaded, so I will close this bug until it occurs again and we can dig more into the issue why the snapshot got outdated.
