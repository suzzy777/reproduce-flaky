Looking at recent builds of 1.2, I see a few of the runs finishing with kills and notice that a JVM exited without reporting back state. Running the hanging test finder, I can see at least that in one case that the balancer tests seem to be outstanding; looking in test output, seems to be still going on.... A few others are reported as hung but they look like they have just started running and are just killed by surefire.

This issue is about trying to disable a few of the problematics like balancer tests to see if our overall stability improves. If so, I can concentrate on stabilizing these few tests. Else will just undo the experiment and put the tests back on line.
