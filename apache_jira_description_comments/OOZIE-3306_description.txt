I wanted to speed up unit testing using [dist_test|https://github.com/cloudera/dist_test] framework and [grind|https://github.com/cloudera/dist_test/blob/master/docs/grind.md] frontend, and it does not work correctly with the hardwired maven dependency plugin version 3.0.2:

Downgrading to version 2.10 solves the problem but it requires manually modify the version number in pom.xml file:

{noformat}
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.10</version>
</plugin>
{noformat}

It would be great to be able to customize the version number without modifying the pom.xml file.
