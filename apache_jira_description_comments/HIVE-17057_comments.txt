Unexpected exception! org.apache.hive.hcatalog.common.HCatException : 9001 : Exception occurred while processing HCat request : MetaException while updating table schema.. Cause : MetaException(message:Persistence Manager has been closed)

It looks that in [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-16844] caused the issue and the committer is tracking the fix in [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-16908]. Would you like to resolve this as duplicate or just add this JIRA to other one?

Thanks [~pgolash].
