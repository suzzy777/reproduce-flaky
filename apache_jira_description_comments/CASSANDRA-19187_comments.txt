bq. Why we want to add a dummy entry for nodetool assassinate if the endpoint is not in the map anymore. Should we do nothing or throw exception if the node is not in the gossip map anymore?

It is intentional to insert a dummy entry if the node doesn't exist, because there can be an issue where a node is quickly being discovered and expiring, and throwing an exception makes it very difficult to assassinate that node.

bq. Before checking if a version is null, we should make sure the node is not a dead node. A decommissioned node, a left node should not be considered part of the cluster anymore when calculating "upgradeInProgressPossible"

I agree, this is what needs to be fixed.


[~brandon.williams] , please review the PR: [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/2978]

If this looks good, I'll create pull request for 4.1 and 5.0 as well. Since we have TCM merged in trunk, I think this gossip related code should not be needed?

This looks good to me, [~curlylrt].  I don't think we need this in trunk due to TCM as you say, but maybe [~samt] can confirm.

Seems right, this specific instance of checking cluster versions via gossip was removed in 5.0 because we don't support upgrades from < 4.0 there, but in general we can more reliably get peer version info from {{ClusterMetadata.current.directory}} now.

Thanks, Sam!

[~brandon.williams] , thanks, updated the 4.0 link.

Unfortunately there seems to be some flakiness in testAssassinatedNodeWillNotContributeToVersionCalculation.

Updated the test

Looks like it still had a [failure|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1417/workflows/d42eb7de-0b45-492c-ab20-7143c4e33537/jobs/67140/tests].

Updated the test, I'm not able to reproduce the failure though.

[~brandon.williams] could you please try the tests again?

I've started just the repeated test for 4.0 [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1420/workflows/a9d53818-ee40-43f3-a9a3-e57087a5a0a7].

Everything passed, +1 from me.

Just a heads-up that "hasMajorVersion3Nodes" method in Gossiper which is used in tests in the patches for this ticket will change its name here 

https://github.com/pauloricardomg/cassandra/commit/ba01b094bcb50766b3dae2da6e4e5dde4579b829

That is patch for 5.0 for CASSANDRA-18999 (similar renaming will be done in 4.0 and 4.1) [~paulo] is driving the merge of that, all is done, we just seem to struggle to run upgrade dtests in Circle due to our free plans for branches of 4.0, 4.1, 5.0, please find the details here:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-18999?focusedCommentId=17801825&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17801825

So, just saying, that if we happen to merge CASSANDRA-18999 first, then the renaming of that method will need to be reflected in this patch too. The logic of that method is changed slightly as well. 

I am +1 on this, just keep in mind my last comment upon merge.

Actually, I'm not sure about this test fix.  How does asserting that we can memoize help us?

I asked here if that is what you mean (1). After looking at it I think that might be just reverted?

(1) https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/2993#discussion_r1429182591

If we go back to asserting the version is null, that is what makes the test flaky, though.

I am not sure what is behind that flakiness yet. Can somebody elaborate on that? In order to get null there, we return NO_UPGRADE_IN_PROGRESS from upgradeFromVersionSupplier ? What is flaky about that? I shall return to this later ... 

I suspect we need to figure out why the endpoint state map's size was not 4 one time in the original flaky result.  If we explicitly add 3 states and then assassinate another non-existing node it should be 4, so something odd is happening here.  That said, I also suspect this is all just a test issue.

[~brandon.williams] the reason it was flaky for checking the size of the map was that the first 3 states may get removed because of this [line.|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/gms/Gossiper.java#L1062]

If the test took longer, the second and third state will be removed because they have been silent for too long. The 3 states/nodes are not set properly and for the purpose of this test, we don't really care about they other 3 nodes, we just need to make sure the non-existing node is in the state map.

I see, thanks, that makes sense.  I guess that leaves us with...

bq. In order to get null there, we return NO_UPGRADE_IN_PROGRESS from upgradeFromVersionSupplier ? What is flaky about that?

The problem is that sometimes we don't get null as we expect, but instead get the current version, as seen [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1417/workflows/d42eb7de-0b45-492c-ab20-7143c4e33537/jobs/67140/tests].
