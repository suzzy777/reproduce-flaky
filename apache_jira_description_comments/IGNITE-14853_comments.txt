This patch includes various improvements for test stabilization.

I expect TC much more stable with these changes.

[~apolovtcev] Can you take a look at network related changes ?

Important changes:
 # Prevented lost message if a received has not discovered a sender yet.
 # Fixed handling of readyAddresses to make sure receiver node is ready for a message processing.
 # Changed various tests logic to be more predictable.

[~sk0x50] Can you take a look as well ?

In general, LGTM.

Merged to master #7d42f95c19c5642d8e00a664aec154a2faa5a357
