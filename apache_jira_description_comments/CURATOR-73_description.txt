This is related to CURATOR-54, and possibly also CURATOR-62.

If a LeaderSelector-thread is cancelled (e.g. because of lost connection to zookeeper), there is no way of restarting it. 
First it jumps out of the doWork-loop, because the interrupt flag is set.
The isQueued flag is not reset when this happens, so requeue() does nothing, even though the thread has been parked.

I'm using curator 2.3.0 with the new ListenerAdapter-way of handling stateChange().
