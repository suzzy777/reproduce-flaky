I’ve seen this happen, too. I think the IDE may be getting a slightly different file due to caching.

The IDE sometimes fail to execute the cases due to some cache or index problem. At this time, you can switch to the shell to execute it again. 

Hi [~jhyde] [~taoran] ,thanks for your reply, I have got your point,and I will close this jira.

I've reopened it, because a flaky test is a problem. It's not high priority, but if someone can find a fix - as I and [~taoran] said above, we suspect caching - it would be appreciated.

A possible explanation why it fails in the IDE, but not from the command line: on or more tests X change some data or does not clean up after its execution. With a randomized test order the tests X may be executed before or after testNoUnintendedNewReservedKeywords, leading to a failure in the former case. Finding which tests belong to X can help finding the cause.

[~thomas.rebele] thanks for suggestions. however, this problem is not the reason of ide, caching, multi-thread or data.

I checked this problem carefully and in-depth. In fact, this case is wrong indeed. The reason why gradle build is normal is because this SqlParserTest was moved into the src/main directory in calcite-1.28, that is, it will not be executed as a unit test. But inheriting its subclasses such as BabelParserTest, ServerParserTest can execute it indirectly. But in calcite-1.28, for this case, it is restricted and cannot be executed in subclasses, that is, it cannot be included in the build or test phase in the end. Here are some important changes:

*<= calcite-1.27.0:* SqlParserTest is in `core/test` dir (this case is right and can be covered by gradle build process)

*calcite-1.28.0 ~ calcite-1.33.0:* move SqlParserTest to `testkit/main` dir (SqlParserTest not in test dir but it can be coverd by BabelParserTest, ServerParserTest indirectly. all cases in SqlParserTest run success except testNoUnintendedNewReservedKeywords, because this case has `not-run-for-subclasses` limitation, so it can't be covered in gradle build process, but this case is right.)

*>= calcite-1.34.0:* this case is wrong, because the keywords are changed in these released version, but not update the static field of SqlParserTest.KEYWORDS. because of the reason above we can't found this failure in the build or ci process.

The solution:
1. fix this case. I have opened a [PR|https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3361] to fix it. but calcite-5564 introduce PERCENTILE_CONT/PERCENTILE_DISC，to let it be NonReservedKeywords, however PERCENTILE_CONT/PERCENTILE_DISC is reserved keywords from sql-2008. it will cause PERCENTILE_CONT/PERCENTILE_DISC case failed in this PR.I will fix it ASAP.

2.Only fix this case is not enough, it will be failed if we not cover it in calcite build process. I have try 2 ways. first way is re-move SqlParserTest to test directory, it's very difficult, because many src/main classes use it. If move it to test dir, these classes can not reference it. second way is remove the `not-run-for-subclasses` this limitation, it meets some other problems, however, it looks like can be solved (I hope get some feedbacks or contexts). 
Or maybe we can customize the test directory, it's a simple way.

In terms of priority, I think PERCENTILE_CONT, PERCENTILE_DISC keywords need to be solved first (to reset it to ReservedKeyWords, if i'm wrong, pls correct me, thanks).

[~julianhyde] [~shenlang] hi, If you have time, pls help to check it. 
 

Hi [~taoran] ,thank you so much for going so deep into this issue,I will reproduce this problem locally today, and I will communicate with you when I have an idea.

I think we should understand why testNoUnintendedNewReservedKeywords this method has a limitation for the child test class not run. I took a look for code git commits and found [commit e89784c2|https://github.com/apache/calcite/commits/e89784c270cab5eafeab839bfd3d4cbea816607f] (part of CALCITE-2457):
{code:java}
[CALCITE-2457] JUnit 4 -> 5: migrate Assume -> Assumptions, drop suites, remove junit4 from core classpath {code}
Let's see if we could get some information from JIRA above.

Thanks again for your professionalism.

[~shenlang] yes. i have noticed this commit either. however i thinks it's a workaround just for juint-5 migration. 

In any case, we need to fix this case first (otherwise the mismatch between keywords and keywords in SqlParserTest will get farther and farther away), and then if necessary, we need to solve the problem that the build process does not cover this case. 

Thanks for your detective work, [~taoran]. It sounds very plausible that we simply stopped running {{SqlParserTest}} directly, and only run its sub-classes.

The reason we do not run this test in sub-classes is that sub-classes will correspond to a different parser, which may legitimately have a different set of keywords.

I think the solution is to move the {{testNoUnintendedNewReservedKeywords}} method from {{SqlParserTest}} to {{CoreParserTest}}. You should still prevent it from running in sub-classes.

[~julianhyde] yes, make sense. I have moved it to CoreParserTest, so it can be covered by build test process. and I have solved some mismatched keywords between KEYWORDS field and Parser. currently may need to fix CALCITE-5920 firstly.

Could you fix CALCITE-5920 in a different commit but the same PR?

[~julianhyde] yes. sure. [https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3366] If you have time, pls help to review it? also welcome other developers to review it, thanks.

Sorry, but please don't ask me personally to review stuff. When others see that I have been asked, they don't step forward to review instead. I have already made my contribution to this case. My contribution has been to get the design right.

got it. we should follow by this. anyone help to review it will be appreciated.

[~taoran] I see used a different commit message from the Jira title, usually we keep them the same, concisely describe the symptoms or what should be the expected behavior.

I presume that "Sometimes" is not needed, it should "always" fail if you run it in IDE directly, am I right? Then I propose to change the Jira title and commit message to "SqlParserTest.testNoUnintendedNewReservedKeywords fails in IDE while passes in command line", if you and others agree, I'll go on and merge it with this message.

[~libenchao] thanks. yes, this case always fail. agree with you. I have changed the commit name and Jira name.

Fixed via [https://github.com/apache/calcite/tree/a7e3f7e7606a074b644d0361e214146f03b2cd3f]

[~taoran] Thanks for your PR! And thanks [~julianhyde] [~shenlang] for the valuable interactions.

Resolved in release 1.36.0 (2023-11-10)
