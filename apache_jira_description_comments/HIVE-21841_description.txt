HMS performs housekeeping tasks. When there are multiple HMSes we need to have a leader HMS elected which will carry out those housekeeping tasks. 
These tasks include execution of compaction tasks, auto-discovering partitions for external tables, generation of compaction tasks, repl thread etc.

Note that, though the code for compaction tasks, auto-discovery of partitions etc. is in Hive, the actual tasks are initiated by an HMS configured to do so. So, leader election is required only for HMS and not for HS2.
