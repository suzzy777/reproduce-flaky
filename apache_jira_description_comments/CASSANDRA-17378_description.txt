Based on the latest ML conversations, the following changes in Config should be reconsidered:

[https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/c51a7c66fc21ca2da08b89ae5f9b4817ee4d8c23]
 * max_streaming_retries - deprecated long time ago but it should be there until at least 5.0. We need to revert this change
 * user_defined_function_warn_timeout_in_ms and user_defined_function_fail_timeout_in_ms name changes were reverted and type will be changed as part of another patch, already in the making.
 * Cherry-pick [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/537ad9e17b820e48df78a7edfe6b3a17d56e08bc]
