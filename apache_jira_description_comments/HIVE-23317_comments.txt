probably related to HIVE-23216

multi_insert_partitioned.q.out is particularily interesting: from what I see it seems like the new "overwritten values" of the table are not always visible at this point:

https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/c4e73766a5c8cc0da0ba5d9387a00d651af4e820/ql/src/test/results/clientpositive/llap/multi_insert_partitioned.q.out#L177



for the partition_wise stuff it seems like the order was not fixed before - so Hive is living with its liberty of returning rows in a different order...

[~soundhearer]: sorry; but this needs to be fixed right away...we have precommit runs with these failing tests
are you looking for some interesting tickets to start working on Hive?  if so...please let me know - I can try to get one for you! :)

[~abstractdog], [~mgergely], [~pvary]: this should be committed right away - to prevent the failure of these in QA runs...
test only change which adds a bunch of order by-s

+1

skipped QA run because this does cause trouble for us...
pushed to master. Thank you [~mgergely] for taking a look!
