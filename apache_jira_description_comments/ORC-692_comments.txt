Thank you for reporting, [~albertoramon]. Does this happen only at 1.7.0?

Hi [~dongjoon]  , 1.6 works fine

I only tested 1.7.0

Can you tell me what version you want to try? 1.6?  I will do it tomorrow




Hey [~albertoramon] ideally we would like to make sure that orc-tools project can compile on 1.5 (branch-1.5) 1.6 (branch-1.6) and the latest 1.7 (master).
If you could check and report your finding here it would be really helpful :) 

We have an `AppVeyor` test coverage, [~albertoramon]. 
- ORC 1.8.0: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/orc/builds/40402443
- ORC 1.7.0: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/orc/builds/40391851

It might be your environment issue. Could you build without `-T` which is known to be flaky?

For now, I'll close this as `Cannot Reproduce` according to AppVeyor status.
And, I'll try to add a test coverage for Window OS in GitHub Action too.

I reopen this because I realized that AppVeyor is not building Java.
```
-DBUILD_JAVA=OFF
```

I'll proceed ORC-875 first and revisit this issue.
