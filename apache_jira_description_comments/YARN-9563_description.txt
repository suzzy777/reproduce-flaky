The Resource Manager's Cluster Applications and Cluster Application REST APIs are sometimes returning invalid JSON. This was addressed in YARN-6082.

However, the fix only fixes the calculation in one site and does not guarantee to avoid the problem.Likewise, generating NaN/Inf can break the web GUI if the columns cannot render non-numeric values.

The suggested fix is to check for NaN/Inf in the protob. The protob replaces NaN/Inf by 0.0f.
