Ambari can only conditionally skip upgrade items based on whether the cluster's security type is {{KERBEROS}} or not. However, there may be a need to fine tune this even further by applying conditional elements to the type of Kerberos in effect, such as only when {{NONE}} is the {{KDCType}}. This would indicate that the cluster's Kerberos configuration is not managed by Ambari.
