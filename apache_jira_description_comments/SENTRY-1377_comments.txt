Code review: https://reviews.apache.org/r/49842/diff/1/

Patch 002:
1) Added safeCloseResultSet() method for consistency. In 3 places the code did not guarantee calling ResultSet.close() in case of a failure.
2) Subtle change in verifyQuery(): the original code placed Assert.assertEquals(n, numRows) check inside the re-try loop. It implies that even after successful executeQuery() the number of rows may not be immediately equal to the expected number and more executeQuery() attempts may be necessary for the number of rows to settle down. Cannot say if that was the actual intent, but that's what the code effectively did. The patch 001 unintentionally moved assertion outside the re-try loop - which implies that once executeQuery() succeeded, the number of returned rows is final and no additional re-tries can change it. Reverting to the original logic though it may not matter.

[~vspector] Looks like the patch cannot be applied?

[~sravya], this patch is out-of-date, since we've decided to re-do it on top of the latest code that split TestHDFSIntegration into several classes. Still on my todo list.

Resuming work on this JIRA. Due to massive refactoring of HDFS integration tests, starting from the beginning. Deleting old patches.

Uploaded second patch: spotted the place in TestHDFSIntegrationAdvanced.java where "grant create" was erroneously used instead of "grant all". Permission "create" is not supported.
