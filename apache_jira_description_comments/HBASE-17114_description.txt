As titled, after HBASE-15146 we will throw {{CallQueueTooBigException}} instead of dead-wait. This is good for performance for most cases but might cause a side-effect that if too many clients connect to the busy RS, that the retry requests may come over and over again and RS never got the chance for recovering, and the issue will become especially critical when the target region is META.

So here in this JIRA we propose to add a new property in name of {{hbase.client.pause.cqtbe}} to make it possible to set a special-longer pause for CallQueueTooBigException, and by default it will use the setting of {{hbase.client.pause}}
