Seems like Beam beam_PreCommit_Python is pretty flaky due to this.

For example,

[https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Beam/view/PostCommit/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Cron/2682/]

[https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Beam/view/PostCommit/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Cron/2680/]

[https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Beam/view/PostCommit/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Cron/2681/]

[https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Beam/view/PostCommit/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Cron/2679/]

 

Pablo, could this be due to [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11270] ?

Hm sorry about the trouble. Starting to take a look...

Working on this. Interestingly enough, it's very hard to reproduce this on my machine. It takes about 15 runs per failure.

Hm I haven't been able to figure out how an erroneous output is appearing here...

Should we consider a rollback since this seems to be making PreCommit pretty flaky ?

 

BTW I see a number of failures for portable_runner_test as well. Not sure if this is related.

[https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Beam/view/PostCommit/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Cron/2685/testReport/junit/apache_beam.runners.portability.portable_runner_test/PortableRunnerTestWithSubprocessesAndMultiWorkers/test_sdf/]

Okay, I guess it makes sense to roll back. Working on that..

Reverting PR: [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11544]

Breakage seems to have started about 3 days ago: [https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Commit/]

I'm suspecting this one:

[https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11514]

(Same test failure is visible from revert [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11544] of  [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11270] )

hmm PR 11514 seems to only deal with monitoring infos... so I'm not sure

I am not 100% sure, but this may be a fix: [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11546] : P

Nevermind. that wasn't it : )

[https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Cron/] seems to indicate even more recent breakage

Interactive_runner_test failed for recent runs of PreCommit_Python. Filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9842.

There is already a Jira tracking test_streaming_wordcount flakiness: BEAM-9767, it's also a duplicate of BEAM-9803. Sam is working on making it deterministic, but we might just need to remove such a multi-threading integration test from being executed on Jenkins.

That test expects some work to be completed within a timeout. If Jenkins is busy during that timeout, the work will not be completed or even started at all, thus causing all kinds of error scenarios such as mismatch result due to incompletion of the work, no PCollection due to no work done and etc.

Okay I'll mark this as resolved then. Thanks!
