[~pbacsko] Can you point me a way to reproduce the problem? I've executed the unit test 200 times using grind without any problems.

[~asalamon74] I saw this during a test execution maybe only once, it could be that it's difficult to reproduce. Order of tests might also play a role, who knows - maybe it's not even possible to reproduce it in a distributed test environment. 

More than one method is flaky in this class. Several methods of {{TestPurgeXCommand}} fail during PreCommit unit tests:

More than on method is flaky in this class and OOZIE-3407 renamed the test methods, so I renamed the JIRA.
