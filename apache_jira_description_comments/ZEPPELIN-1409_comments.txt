After these changes I finally started getting more green builds on Travis.CI

    One of the builds failed with the following, which seems not related
    
    - should provide onclick method *** FAILED ***
      The code passed to eventually never returned normally. Attempted 1 times over 1.164197794 seconds. Last failure message: 0 was not equal to 1. (AbstractAngularElemTest.scala:72)

    @bzz @Leemoonsoo Please review


[~luciano resende] this seems like a Zeppelin ticket. Was it filed in the wrong place? I haven't seen any RAT problems in Spark.

    I think having a separate profile it is reasonable approach for CI. Though I also think there is value in keepinv the default behaviour for local Dev workflow and make RAT check on by default.
    
    In order to communicate the value of such fix better, I would suggest  linking to JIRA/here the logs of CI builds that have faild due to RAT issue as well.


Examples of build failing due to RAT:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/157252129/log.txt
https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/157252130/log.txt
https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/157353304/log.txt
etc...

Most of my PRs are having these issues, and from some tests, these changes seems to help overcome these issues.

As of ZEPPELIN-278, I believe this is at least complementary to those changes.

    @bzz  this has now been updated to follow the same pattern used for maven tests, enable RAT to run by default, but support disabling it with -DskipRat. Travis CI will run RAT once, on the RAT build, and disable RAT checks on all other build profiles.


Github user corneadoug commented on the issue:

    Then how about we use -DskipRat on all building profiles, and have a profile that run only RAT without building?
    
    Build time is pretty long, so it would be nice to separate some easy check that do not need compilation or specific settings separated, we would keep the CI feedback loop shorter and it would also be easier to know what failed without going to the log.
    
    It could probably also be applied to things like Style Check or Unit Tests later

    @corneadoug This is exactly what is implemented on this pr.


Github user corneadoug commented on the issue:

    @lresende My bad, when I first read I understood that RAT would be included in one profile that would still build everything. (just like we do with the -DskipTests)

    Looks good to me, merging if there is no further discussion.

Thanks for merging this, I am finally able to get a full set of rebased PRs passing all builds, hopefully this is going to help the overall build/pr success rate going forward.
