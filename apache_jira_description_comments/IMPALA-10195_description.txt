custom_cluster.test_admission_controller.TestAdmissionControllerStress.test_mem_limit fails with a familiar assertion:
{code}
custom_cluster/test_admission_controller.py:1856: in test_mem_limit
    {'request_pool': self.pool_name, 'mem_limit': query_mem_limit})
custom_cluster/test_admission_controller.py:1754: in run_admission_test
    assert metric_deltas['admitted'] >= expected_admitted
E   assert 0 >= 5
{code}

The failure looks eerily similar to IMPALA-8342. That one was closed 18 months ago, so I'm hesitant to reopen it, but it is linked as related.
Tagging [~bikramjeet.vig] and [~tarmstrong@cloudera.com] as the they looked at the same flakiness at that time.
