When a Flink checkpoint is taken, the current bundle is finalized. The finalization happens when the checkpoint barrier has already been sent downstream; emitting elements at this point would violate the checkpoint barrier alignment.

When elements are emitted during checkpointing they are buffered until the checkpoint is complete. We should ensure that they are keyed correctly and emission of the buffered elements does not interfere with any concurrent state requests (in case of portability).
