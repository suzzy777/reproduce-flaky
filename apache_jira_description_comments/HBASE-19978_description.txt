The worker thread will just exit after keep alive time, and we never add it back. The only way to add it back is through the stuck checker, this is not correct. Here we should start new worker thread if it is under the core pool size and there are pending procedures.

For now the default keep alive time is Long.MAX_VALUE which means no timeout so no problem, but we do allow users to set it so we need to fix it.
