The concept "cluster" is misused in docker integration tests. There should be a single cluster containing all the containers on a single network. As there are multiple clusters now with the same network the cleanup process is convoluted and flaky.

The "cluster" and the "container" concepts are also mixed up in places, so there should be an explicit Container concept in the code.
