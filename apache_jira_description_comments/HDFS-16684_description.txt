The JournalNodeSyncer will include the local instance in syncing when using a bind host (e.g. 0.0.0.0).  There is a mechanism that is supposed to exclude the local instance, but it doesn't recognize the meta-address as a local address.

Running with bind addresses set to 0.0.0.0, the JournalNodeSyncer will log attempts to sync with itself as part of the normal syncing rotation.  For an HA configuration running 3 JournalNodes, the "other" list used by the JournalNodeSyncer will include 3 proxies.
