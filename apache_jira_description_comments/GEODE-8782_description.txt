In some cases it would be very helpful to have access to the {{Principal}} when executing a function.

It may seem obvious that if one has a reference to the {{cache}} that you could get to the {{SecurityManager}} and extract the {{Subject}} and thus the {{Principal}} from there. However, in some cases, Geode will seamlessly proxy a function call from one server to the other. This will typically happen with {{onRegion}} calls and partitioned regions. In such cases, the security context is lost and thus the principal is not accessible.
