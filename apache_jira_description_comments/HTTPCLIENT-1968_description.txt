URIs that contain an encoded forward slash (%2F) are no longer preserved when the HTTP client executes. I came across this when upgrading from 4.5.2 to 4.5.7 and my requests that contained an encoded forward slash suddenly started failing. The appears to be due to decoding and re-encoding of the path that takes place in the URIUtils#rewriteURI method. I've attached a patch that restores the old behavior but if a URI contains two slashes in a row in addition to an encoded slash the encoded forward slash will be decoded.
