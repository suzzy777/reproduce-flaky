Thanks, [~lirui]. Patch looks good to me. Could take a look at the above test failures? Thanks.

Hi [~xuefuz], I checked the errors and I guess we have to sort the query results before diff. I wonder what's the correct way to do it. For example, I added {{-- SORT_BEFORE_DIFF}} at the beginning of groupby1.q but the test failed.

The test passes if I add {{-- SORT_BEFORE_DIFF}} after the {{set}} commands in {{groupby1.q}} though...

Hi [~lirui] Have you try -- SORT_BEFORE_DIFF, which is to sort the query result, which is different from SORT_BEFORE_DIFF. It's supposed to make query result sorted w/o an order by.

BTW, do you know why changing the key from BytesWrtiable to HiveKey would require to regenerate these test output?

[~xuefuz], spark doesn't guarantee order for group-by queries. And the hash code of BytesWrtiable and HiveKey are computed differently. So the records produced by the mappers are likely to be partitioned to different reducers. I believe that's why we got different results (only different in order) after the change.

I don't quite get the point of your last comment. I did try adding {{-- SORT_BEFORE_DIFF}} in the q file. It just seems the test framework is a little particular about where we should put it (the test failed to run if I put it before the {{set}} commands in the q file).
[~brocknoland] do you have any comments as how to use the {{-- SORT_BEFORE_DIFF}} label?

This patch fixes some failed qfile tests caused by last patch.
Two qtests are not fixed: {{optimize_nullscan.q}} and {{union_remove_25.q}}.
For {{optimize_nullscan.q}}  I checked the corresponding MR output and found the operator tree in the new output file is more similar to the one in the MR version output. Besides this failure is of age 2, so I guess it's not related to the patch here.
For {{union_remove_25.q}}, the only diff is the total size of {{outputTbl2}} (6812 -> 6826). I checked the MR version and the total size is also 6812. I'm not sure what causes this difference. Maybe need to do more tests for partitioned table.
[~xuefuz] do you have any idea on this?

I don't think nullscan is related as it's been failing for other runs. I created HIVE-8032 to fix that.

bq. do you have any comments as how to use the {{-- SORT_BEFORE_DIFF}} label?

I am surprised the query failed if that was before the the set commands? I think the big item is to ensure that the comment flag {{--}} is before the text {{SORT_BEFORE_DIFF}}. The code which implements this is here: https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/itests/util/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/QTestUtil.java#L416

This comment indeeded made no sense. Sorry for the confusion, I meant "-- SORT_QUERY_RESULTS" for the first "-- SORT_BEFORE_DIFF". So my comment should really go like this:

{quote}

{quote}

 SORT_BEFORE_DIFF sorts the output files before making diff. It's less reliable, and sometimes the diff doesn't tell what's wrong. Thus, I think we should prefer SORT_QUERY_RESULTS when query output can diff in order. 

Neither do I know why SORT_BEFORE_DIFF has to come after set commands in your case, but it seems the usage of it in the .q files is not consistent on that front.

For union_remove_25.q, the only diff is the total size of outputTbl2 (6812 -> 6826). I checked the MR version and the total size is also 6812. I'm not sure what causes this difference.
{quote}

I have no clue either, but I had the same observation before. Nevertheless, this should be okay since the output data matches. It doesn't seem worth the time to drill down, at least for now.

Thanks [~xuefuz] and [~brocknoland]. I'll try {{-- SORT_QUERY_RESULTS}} instead.
But it seems adding that to the qfiles caused these tests fail for MR and Tez since the output files are different now. Do you think I should update the output for MR and Tez as well?

[~lirui] That depends on the query. If the query semantically doesn't guarantee the order of the output, updating MR/Tez golden file should be okay. We know MR, and possibly Tez give ordered the output even the query doesn't require it. I guess this is the case for the test failures here.

It might make sense to create a trunk JIRA to address the MR/Tez golden files changes. This would make future merge easier.

Hi [~xuefuz] I quickly checked the latest failures and I think they are caused by the {{-- SORT_BEFORE_DIFF}} label. The diff is mainly something like:
{noformat}
> POSTHOOK: query: CREATE TABLE dest_g1(key INT, value DOUBLE) STORED AS TEXTFILE
366d362
< POSTHOOK: query: -- SORT_BEFORE_DIFF
375a372
> PREHOOK: query: CREATE TABLE dest_g1(key INT, value DOUBLE) STORED AS TEXTFILE
379d375
< PREHOOK: query: -- SORT_BEFORE_DIFF
{noformat}

There's no diff in the results.

Let's make that change (adding SORT_BEFORE_DIFF ) on trunk and then we can merge it in. Otherwise if there are any updates to the file in trunk it will be a lot of work to do the merge.

Thanks!

Hi [~brocknoland] I've created HIVE-8035 for it.
Do you think I should also update the outputs for MR and Tez in this JIRA as well (mainly to make the tests pass)?

Yep!

Use SORT_QUERY_RESULTS instead of SORT_BEFORE_DIFF.
And update golden files for MR/Tez as well.

+1.

One question, is the latest patch including the changes included in HIVE-8035? If so, we may need to wait until HIVE-8035 is resolved and merged to Spark branch.

[~xuefuz] yes it includes changes in HIVE-8035. Let me submit a patch for HIVE-8035 first.
Regarding the latest test failure, do you think it's related to the patch here?

No that's an infra issue. The test framework uses ec2 which can at times be flaky. 

Thanks [~brocknoland] I rebased my patch.

I didn't update golden file for {{union_remove_25.q}} as the original total size (6812) is the same with MR version. I think that's all right for now, as long as we don't have diff in the query results.

The null_scan is covered here HIVE-8032.

[~ruili] I think it might be better to update union_remove_25.q, so we will see one less failure every time the test runs. What do you think?

[~xuefuz] OK, I'll do that.
BTW, do you think we need a JIRA to track this difference so we can find the cause when we have time?

Update the golden file for union_remove_25
