AMBARI-9644. Spark Service check fails if ATS is not running during cluster bringup. (Gautam Borad via yusaku) (yusaku: http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=ambari.git&a=commit&h=ae38076ab41391714ae5003e4cb31e7015686f55)

The UT failures are not related to this patch.  They seem to be flaky unit tests as I cannot reproduce.
