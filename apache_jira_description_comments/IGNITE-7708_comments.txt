I've moved org.apache.ignite.testsuites.IgniteComputeBasicConfigVariationsFullApiTestSuite to Basic2 to avoid odd notifications on flaky failures.

( https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_IgniteBasic2&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=%3Cdefault%3E&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv )


I committed a potential fix for this issue: c57488acd3dc42f1ad93bf235026217358cc5442
Will monitor TC for a while and close the issue if these failures disappear.

According to mass run-all results this fix helped. [http://apache-ignite-developers.2346864.n4.nabble.com/MTCGA-5th-mass-run-all-td30174.html]

 

I think most of failures fixed came from this fix. I suggest to resolve this issue as far as  IGNITE-8079 

Closing this issue since no massive test failures are observed.
