   I see you are binding the subject to the threads running the function and also adding the the parameter `principal` to the constructor of the `FunctoinContext`, I wonder if we only need to do one of the two? If subject is already in the thread context, you don't need to pass it in the constructor, you can just directly get it from the thread local by calling `getCache().getSecurityService().getPrinicipal()`

Review comment:
       Instead of this, I think you could make this class implement VersionedDataSerializable which might handle writing the principal differently.

Review comment:
       I tried that but had some upgrade tests that became flaky. I may have done something wrong, but using `VersionedDataSerializable` seemed to not work for this.

   @jinmeiliao Yes, good idea. I've added the principal to `FunctionContextImpl` and removed the code that rebound the `Subject` on function threads.
   
   @upthewaterspout I've also removed the default implementation for `FunctionContext.getPrincipal()` since FunctionContext (and impls) are never serialized anywhere and it is also never implemented by user code.

   After you are done with this, can you file another jira ticket to redo the `QueryCommand`? Currently we are sending the principal using `DataCommandRequest`, now that the principal is in the function context, we don't need to do that anymore. Or if you can lump it into this PR, that would be great too!

   > Historically we have never changed serialization version between patches releases. Gfsh used to rely on this but now I think will be fine, but we still may encounter some surprises. Also GEODE_1_12_1 (and this entire change) will need to be added to support/1.13 and develop if hasn't been already.
   
   Yes, that's correct, but I don't think we can actually do that yet until we have an actual `1.12.1` release to point to. Correct me if that's not right.
