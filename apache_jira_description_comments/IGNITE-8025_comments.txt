[~dpavlov], please take a look at the change.

[~andrey-kuznetsov], I left one question in the review, will review later rest of this change.

[~andrey-kuznetsov], it seems run-all was not finished because of cancel Ignite Mem Leaks suite.

So I've re-triggered run-all https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F3687%2Fhead&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv

Hope it will be completed today by night.

Change itself looks reasonable to me.

[~dpavlov], I've launched some suites (including Memory Leaks) separately to ensure test validity. So, there is no need to wait for one more launch completion.

I've found 2 suspicious tests
   Binary Objects (Simple Mapper Queries) [ tests 4 ]  
...
     IgniteBinarySimpleNameMapperCacheQueryTestSuite: IgniteCacheLocalQueryCancelOrTimeoutSelfTest.testQueryCancelZeroTimeout (master fail rate 0,0%) 
     IgniteBinarySimpleNameMapperCacheQueryTestSuite: IgniteSqlSplitterSelfTest.testReplicatedTablesUsingPartitionedCacheClient (master fail rate 0,0%) 

Could you please check if these failures not related to change?

[~dpavlov], thanks for your alertness. I've executed this suite again, and it turned green. Probably, new flaky tests nave been found.

Thank you for contribution in Ignite test framework, this allowed tests to run more stable.

Merged your changes. Let's keep an eye on TeamCity.
