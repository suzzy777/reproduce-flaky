The methods [{{SecondaryIndexManagerTest.assertMarkedAsBuilt}}|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/index/SecondaryIndexManagerTest.java#L554-L557] and [{{SecondaryIndexManagerTest.assertNotMarkedAsBuilt}}|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/index/SecondaryIndexManagerTest.java#L559-L562] produce occasional test failures. 

These methods assume that there aren't any other indexes in the {{system.IndexInfo}} table than those created by the calling test. However, it is possible to find indexes built for other tests (not only {{SecondaryIndexManagerTest}}) that rely on {{CQLTester.afterTest}} to cleanup to drop their created indexes, because this method is asynchronous. So, it is possible to reach the {{SecondaryIndexManagerTest.assert(Not)MarkedAsBuilt}} calls before the indexes created by the previous test have been cleaned up.
