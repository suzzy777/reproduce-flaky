[~ilyak], I do not think the suggested change is correct. Instead of using a native byte order all over the code, we need to have a single place where byte order is specified (via configuration or system property) and use this value in the places you changed.

The reason for this is that it would be good to have persistence files created on one architecture, copied to another architecture, and a node should successfully start. This can be done only if we have the same byte order for both runs.

[~agoncharuk] Unfortunately I don't have a concrete list of places which we should do this change. Unfortunately we don't have robust testing environment for it either :(

[~agoncharuk] I have created a ticket to make it configurable, let's split it into phase 2.

Good, agree with a 2-phase change. LGTM.
