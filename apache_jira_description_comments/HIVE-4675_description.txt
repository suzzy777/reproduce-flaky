The current ptest tool is great, but it has the following limitations:

-Requires an NFS filer
-Unless the NFS filer is dedicated ptests can become IO bound easily
-Investigating of failures is troublesome because the source directory for the failure is not saved
-Ignoring or isolated tests is not supported
-No unit tests for the ptest framework exist

It'd be great to have a ptest tool that addresses this limitations.
