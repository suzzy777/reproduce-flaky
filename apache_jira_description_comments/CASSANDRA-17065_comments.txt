[~frankgh], thanks for the patch. I left the comments inline in the PR.

lgtm, could you just run the cci tests with the latest commit?

Thanks for looking at it. I am running CI tests now

Both CI and Jenkins has failed test but does not look related. [~frankgh], can you double check? 

The {{test_timeuuid - upgrade_tests.cql_tests}} looks broken. Just filed a new ticket: CASSANDRA-17133

I manually inspected the failing tests and there seems to be 3 categories of "new failing" tests. All unrelated to the commit.

- `timeuuid` failing tests are unrelated
- `failThresholdSinglePartition` fails in the build, but it is passing locally
- `testCompactingCFCounting` compacting flaky test, unrelated to the commit

Thanks [~frankgh].

Is failing only on your branch in CI env or already failing on trunk? Do we already have a [ticket|https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12350869] for it?

[~jmckenzie] That test only failed in Jenkins. In Circle CI the test is passing. I don't think it deserved a ticket at the moment.
