[~gezapeti] hope I could get some insights from you, I started looking at this and this involves a lot of surgery. I see we have an empty.xml descriptor in the parent pom which is not sufficient for assembly plugin to work in versions > 2.2.1. I got it to work somewhat with example here [https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/examples/multimodule/module-source-inclusion-simple.html] but it failed on sharelib. I think this will involve a lot of conversation. Could use your advice.

Thanks for picking this up!

I don't know much about the assembly-plugin and don't have the time right no to dig into it. It certainly looks like we're misusing something in the current build so it'd be nice to clean things up abit.

getting [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-assembly-plugin:2.2.1:single (default-cli) on project oozie-main: Error reading assemblies: No assembly descriptors found. -> [Help 1]
[ERROR]

You can try to user ignoreMissingDescriptor property and delete empty.xml file.
{code:java}
<plugin>
 <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
 <configuration>
 <ignoreMissingDescriptor>true</ignoreMissingDescriptor>
 <attach>false</attach>
 </configuration>
 </plugin>{code}

[~slachiewicz] you are correct, ignoreMissingDescriptor is a GO. It also needs when using newer version of assembly plugin than 2.2.1. Unfortunately, 2.2.1 is not capable to handle more than 2GiB of tar archive so upgrading it will be necessary in the future.

Please let us know if MASSEMBLY-889 has influence on you. We are waiting there for feedback

[~slachiewicz] I was able to create a 3.9GiB tar.gz using the maven assembly plugin using 3.1.0 of assembly plugin.

Retriggering to see whether the issue builds without test errors.

PreCommit build has error:
{code:java}
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.rat:apache-rat-plugin:0.12:check (default-cli) on project oozie-main: Too many files with unapproved license: 1 See RAT report in: /home/jenkins/jenkins-slave/workspace/PreCommit-OOZIE-Build/target/rat.txt -&gt; [Help 1]{code}
And several test errors due to {code}java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused{code}

[~dionusos] the RAT warning on {{master}} is because of OOZIE-2734, amendment patch is available.

If you know why there are test errors related {{ConnectException}}, please feel free to create a JIRA / patch :) Even just creating a subtask of OOZIE-3111 would suffice.

The RAT warning and the test failures seems to be resolved. Retriggeerd the PreCommit build: [https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-OOZIE-Build/924/]
