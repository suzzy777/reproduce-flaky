https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-7157

I have pushed a new branch called github_actions to https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/zeppelin.git. Because of the mirroring process, this branch is now also available on [GitHub|https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/github_actions].
And our first github action was triggered. https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/actions/runs/385395557

Closed with https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3986
