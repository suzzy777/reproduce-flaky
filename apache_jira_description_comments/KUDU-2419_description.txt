Adding Java/Gradle support to dist-test will allow for much faster pre-commit checks and to expose the Flaky tests in the same place as our c++ tests. Currently the flakies are hidden in the logs and we have no idea how common they are. 

As an anecdotal point of reference Gradle does not have flaky retries and I have had a hard time getting a clean pre-commit build.
