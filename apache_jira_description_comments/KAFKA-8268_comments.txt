SaslSslAdminClientIntegrationTest was renamed to SaslSslAdminIntegrationTest (see [this|https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/400185421f008662ee6f92298154151493486c1e]) so I updated the title.

Since this is not a blocker issue, as part of the 2.6.0 release process I'm changing the fix version to `2.6.1` and `2.7.0`. If this is incorrect, please respond and discuss on the "[DISCUSS] Apache Kafka 2.6.0 release" discussion mailing list thread.

Since this is not a blocker, there is no active PRÂ  I'm clearing the "fix version" field as part of the 2.7.0 release process.
