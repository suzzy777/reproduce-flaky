When I read FsActionExecutor.java, I found a not good code in this class.  When judging which logic to use based on commands, should use "switch/case" replace "if/else":
 # “if/else” make the code hard to read
 # “if/else” make the code hard to extend
 # “if/else” has low  efficience

So I suggest using “switch/case” instead.
