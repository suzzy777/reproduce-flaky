Right now sharelib can be created via {{sharelib create -fs FS_URI -locallib SHARED_LIBRARY}} where the SHARED_LIBRARY can be a tarbal or a folder. 

It would be nice to have the possibility to define additional folders to be uploaded into the sharelib, so the users don't have to copy or link the files together on their machine.

The syntax could be something like -additional-lib sharelibName=/path/to/source/;/path/to/some/file,sharelibName2=/path/to/some/folder
