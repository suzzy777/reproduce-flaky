bq. BTW, the patch of HBASE-6820 is not committed in 0.94.
No it is not. Do you need to have this patch for 0.94? In that case we have to open another issue for backporting that to 0.94. 


For the killOneBackupZooKeeperServer(), I think you are closing the the ZKDatabase for the active server instead of the backupZkServer: 
{code}
+    zooKeeperServers.get(activeZKServerIndex).getZKDatabase().close();
+
     // remove this backup zk server
     standaloneServerFactoryList.remove(backupZKServerIndex);
{code}

My mistake. Fix it by uploading v2 patch and thanks for reviewing.

bq. Do you need to have this patch for 0.94?
I think it's better to fix it because our codebase is 0.94.

Do you mind backporting the patch for HBASE-6820? We cannot commit this to 0.94 unless the backport is there. 

Backporting HBASE-6820 seems good for us. Thanks for considering. [~enis]
Let's opening another issue to do that.

bq. Do you mind backporting the patch for HBASE-6820
I meant do you want to do the backport : ) 

Thank [~enis] and you're so considerate. It's all good as long as the problem is solved.
HBASE-10306 is opened and needs a quick fix.

Thank [~lhofhansl] to resolve HBASE-10306 and please commit this by the way. 

[~stack], [~apurtell], I assume you want this (test stability fix) in 0.96/0.98.

One HadoopQA run was good, the other failed org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.lock.TestZKInterProcessReadWriteLock. Has anyone tested if this changes makes our ZK unit tests flaky?

Anyway, we can try it on 0.98. If tests do flake, I can revert and recommit to 0.98.1.

Let's try the qa one more time. I'll also run the test a couple of times. 

Reattaching the patch for hadoopqa. 

Run TestZKInterProcessReadWriteLock 20 times. I'll commit this if hadoopqa reports ok.
