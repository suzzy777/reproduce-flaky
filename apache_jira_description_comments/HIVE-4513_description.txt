HiveHistory log files (hive_job_log_hive_*.txt files) store information about hive query such as query string, plan , counters and MR job progress information.

There is no mechanism to delete these files and as a result they get accumulated over time, using up lot of disk space. 
I don't think this is used by most people, so I think it would better to turn this off by default. Jobtracker logs already capture most of this information, though it is not as structured as history logs.
