This is the current code

{code}
  /**
   * retrieve the next path to use for writing. Increments the internal filenum.
   */
  private Path getNewPath() throws IOException {
    this.filenum.set(EnvironmentEdgeManager.currentTime());
    Path newPath = getCurrentFileName();
    while (fs.exists(newPath)) {
      this.filenum.incrementAndGet();
      newPath = getCurrentFileName();
    }
    return newPath;
  }
{code}

In some tests, we inject our own EnvironmentEdge, it may return the same ts always or even go backwards, the logic here is not rnough to keep the filenum monotone increasing, as we may have already archive the old file.
