In the interim, the offending line has been commented out of the test.

After running this query repeatedly, I have found that even if the refresh is commented out, the following line
{{self.execute_query_using_client(client, QUERY, vector)}}
still occasionally causes the query to fail.

The issue was that the connection to the catalog server was not being Reopened when we detected the connection was broken.

I am working on looking into the tests that look into this issue. As it stands, the test is flaky and passes half the time.

Due to the nature of the flaky tests, the fact that these tests have been disabled for a while anyways, and the impending release, I am moving this back to 2.1

It was determined that Lenni's fix actually did fix this issue. This was discussed in IMPALA-1328
