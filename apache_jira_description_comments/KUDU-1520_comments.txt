[~adar] -- is the above-mentioned stress test checked in nowadays? Would be good to know if the issue is still around, and if so which test can be used to repro.

Yes, it was merged as master-stress-test.

I don't see this issue in the flaky test dashboard (at least not for master-stress-test), but I'd be surprised if it had been accidentally fixed.

[~adar] is this still an issue?

Yes. I looked through the AlterSchema/AlterSchemaState/TransactionDriver code and I think it's still vulnerable to this race.
