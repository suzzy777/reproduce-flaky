This seems to be known issue from the original ticket where the test class was introduced. Check the comments in CASSANDRA-18670 and this run:

It looks like all the failures I can find associated with this issue result from a node restart in the test, where the ByteBuddy injection fails for several different reasons. There are no failures on cluster startup. It should be pointed out here that the injection is expected to be disabled after the restart so is not really needed.

To try and fix this, I have restructured the inject logic to only inject on the first start of the node and not inject on any further starts. This looks to have fixed the issue but I am repeating the test runs a number of times to make sure of this.

[~adelapena] I'd like you to have a look at this to make sure that my assumption about the injection not being needed is correct at all points after the restart.

Repeats look good.

+1 on both PRs

I really tried to share the cluster in that test, but it's simpler now at least.
