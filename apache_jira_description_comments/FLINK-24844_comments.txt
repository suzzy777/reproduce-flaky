[~echauchot] one more cassandra issue. Can you PTAL?

[~arvid] yes I can take a look when I have time but I don't have an azure env to test, is there a sandbox env for testing on azure or do I need to open a non-mergeable PR just for testing on azure? Or maybe use the ASF provided licences ? Can you assign to me ?

Ideally, you should be able to execute the test locally. 

Submitting a draft PR is certainly also an option if you want to hot loop the test on azure. You can actually already create a "[FLINK-24844][cassandra] Stabilize CassandraConnectorITCase.testCassandraBatchPojoFormat" draft OR where you add your debugging things and later force push your actual fix and undraft it.

Hi Till, thanks for the pointer. I plan to work on this issue when I'm done with [this|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-22775] other Cassandra flaky test.

Thanks [~echauchot] for looking into this issue!

Hi [~trohrmann], my pleasure ! Once [this cassandra PR|https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/17849] is merged, I'll take a look at the above flakiness issue.

[~echauchot] With that PR merged, have you been able to take a look at this one? 

[~MartijnVisser] not yet unfortunately

But maybe a big rework on Cassandra tests makes sense: cf https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-23047?focusedCommentId=17452328&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17452328

[~echauchot] That makes sense. Let me chip in on that thread. 

As can be seen in the umbrella ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-25147 that Cassandra tests are now using the testcontainers. We're going to monitor the Cassandra tests until the new year and if no new occurences are popping up, we are closing this (and the other subtasks) as resolved

Fixed via FLINK-25147.

All pojo tests suffer from the same flakiness that should be fixed with 

master: 153bb9b5fa04ae7de8aef22c346a1c342a376c59
1.14: a03343682f2ca99b3b97572246c9b4a634752fa4

Reopening, to monitor the flakiness after the above change

1.13 https://dev.azure.com/apache-flink/apache-flink/_build/results?buildId=30465&view=logs&j=d44f43ce-542c-597d-bf94-b0718c71e5e8&t=03dca39c-73e8-5aaf-601d-328ae5c35f20&l=13913

Hi [~echauchot] could we also pick the fix to 1.13~?

[~gaoyunhaii] it was already backported to 1.13
cf: 26fb7a269f5fe3fc5dd0d52d88afb2915e452d1b
 
 

[~gaoyunhaii] The fix was merged a bit more than 7 days ago. I can check the stats through [https://dev.azure.com/apache-flink/apache-flink/_test/analytics?definitionId=1&contextType=build.|https://dev.azure.com/apache-flink/apache-flink/_test/analytics?definitionId=1&contextType=build]

This is for job flink-ci.flink-master-mirror. I guess it is on branch master right ? How can I get the same analytics for 1.13 and 1.14 branches? 

Hi [~echauchot] the failure happens on 1.13: https://dev.azure.com/apache-flink/apache-flink/_build/results?buildId=30465&view=results. On the master mirror there are also cron jobs for 1.13 & 1.14. 

And for the analysis, it seems we could choose the branch from the menu on the top right~?

Thanks for the tip [~gaoyunhaii], I can now check per branch.

Another failure.
