[~bereng] now both links show passed and I ran it [1000 times|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/898/workflows/157d2d48-f3be-4709-b3e0-b49c900177a3/jobs/5340/artifacts] and it succeeded. I am puzzled.... I saw it failing in CI too, but now the status is changed....

Alright, it failed three times out of 1000 with Java 11 but this time it shows we used less heap space... To be precise - Build on Java 8 run with Java 11 - https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/898/workflows/157d2d48-f3be-4709-b3e0-b49c900177a3/jobs/5380

Java 11 build and run is passing 1000 times

/CC [~barnie] as I am running out of ideas with this one...

[~e.dimitrova] if jenkins does the fail/pass/fail dance to you go to the actual stage test results and the it shows failed always: https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-4.0-test/51/jdk=jdk_11_latest,label=cassandra,split=2/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.cql3/MemtableSizeTest/testSize/ 

One observation I have is that the times when the test fails the _deepSizeBefore_ is the only thing that differs and leads to the difference and test failures. So now I am wondering what causes that. 

That one we measure [here |https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/3b553d8e13dbdbe59119de9c917d9aacc440741e/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/cql3/MemtableSizeTest.java#L69].

I had an offline discussion and it seems this test can flake sometimes based on the CI infrastructure and not due to product defect. -The suggestion is to mark it as flaky which I have done- [-here-|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commit/dd0f55567/3c26e90b1a1a13204195b89b1644]

[~blerer] -or- [~blambov]-, do you mind to review, please?- 

[~blambov] already did a pass. 

New version:

[https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/blob/f635755025ebf27bf3868b40e033d04ae1133689/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/cql3/MemtableSizeTest.java|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commit/f635755025ebf27bf3868b40e033d04ae1133689]

New version LGTM.

Thank you for the quick review!

[~e.dimitrova] this came up again [here|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-4.0.0/8/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.cql3/MemtableSizeTest/testTruncationReleasesLogSpace_cdc/] and it is already the version that has been marked as flaky #collaborating I am wondering if env can have such an impact whether this test makes sense? Do you remember details of that offline conversation on how env might make it fail? I am curious thx!
