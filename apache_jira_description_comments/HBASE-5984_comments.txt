Looked into it and found it is really a flaky one.  The issue is that it is too flaky.  It always fails on me with HADOOP 2.0.0.

Put up a patch to disable this test for now.

This test is useful - though flaky.

We can detect the hadoop version in test util and return early from this test if the version is beyond x.y

Sure, it is fine with me.

If this test is disabled rather than improved, then we have no test that checks if HBase can survive a rolling restart of DataNodes, correct?


If the test is flakey, lets disable it.  This test is broke in 0.90 branch too.

We need some enhancement from the HDFS side.

So, commit this to trunk for now?  Open a critical issue against 0.96 to get this test back or at least add another test form for rolling restart of DNs under hbase?   I'd be up for doing this.

+1 on the above suggestion.

As long as we can test and assure that HBase survives a rolling DN restart. 

I'm not sure how common that scenario is but we've had to do it twice: once to fix a DN bug, once to fix a configuration mistake. 


Applied to trunk.  Thanks for the patch Jimmy.

I made a blocker on 0.96.0, HBASE-5995, to fix and reenable this test.

@stack Can you please apply it to 0.94 as well? 

Applied to 0.94 too at [~aklochkov] 's request.

Thank you, [~stack]!
