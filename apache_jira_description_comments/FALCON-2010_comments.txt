    FALCON-2010 Fix UT errors due to ActiveMQ upgrade

    Fixed two test failures due to the upgrade:
    
    1. JMSMessageConsumerTest
    After upgrade, some messages are consumed faster and so the initial expectation on no message being dequeued right after the message sending doesn't hold. Also confirmed with @bvellanki that this kind of tests are flaky and have caused intermittent test errors before. Therefore, removed getTotalDequeueCount assertion. In addition, the expected message consumptions are tested in existing code "Mockito.verify(jobEndService,...".
    
    2. FalconPostProcessingTest
    After upgrade, Falcon will run into an error if it tries to delete messages when ActiveMQ service is stopped. Therefore, need to call start before deleting the message during teardown.
