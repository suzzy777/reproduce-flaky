Upgrade ZK dependency to 3.4.13.  This fixes ZOOKEEPER-2184 which will make the ZK client re-resolve the server hostnames when a connection fails.  This will fix issues where a failed ZK container is replaced with a new one that has a different IP address and DNS gets updated with the new address.

Typically these upgrades do not require code changes, but that should be verified.
