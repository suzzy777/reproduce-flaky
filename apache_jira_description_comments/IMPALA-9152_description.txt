Looks like the test was expecting column masking error but encountered row filtering error.

got error:
Impala does not support row filtering yet. Row filtering is enabled on table: functional.alltypes_view
expected:
Impala does not support column masking yet. Column masking is enabled on column: functional.alltypes_view.string_col {code}
