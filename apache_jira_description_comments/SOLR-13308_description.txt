[~krisden] just traced flaky HDFS tests to not clearing sysprops, see the discussion at SOLR-13297.

Part of SOLR-13268 is to derive all Solr test classes from SolrTestCase.

Once that's pushed, does it make sense to put that rule in SolrTestCase so it gets performed automagically so this kind of error doesn't creep back in?

I don't know the details of how that rule is implemented or whether this makes sense at that level but wanted to discuss.

I've assigned it to myself, but that's just so I don't lose track of it, but anyone else who wants to pick it up please feel free.
