On ticket CASSANDRA-16619 some files were changed to allow Cassandra to store HostID in the new "me" SSTable version.

But SSTables flushed during CommitLogReplay miss this HostID info.

 

In the next Cassandra startup, if these SSTables were still present, system.log will show:


{{WARN Origin of 3 sstables is unknown or doesn't match the local node; commitLogIntervals for them were ignored}}

{{WARN }}{{{}Origin of 3 sstables is unknown or doesn't match the local node; commitLogIntervals for them were ignored{}}}{{{}{}}}{{ }}

 

And debug.log will show a list of SSTables, witch can include "md" and "me" version (before upgradesstables):

 

{{Ignored commitLogIntervals from the following sstables: [/var/lib/cassandra/data/system/compaction_history-b4dbb7b4dc493fb5b3bfce6e434832ca/me-3-big-Data.db, /var/lib/cassandra/data/system/compaction_history-b4dbb7b4dc493fb5b3bfce6e434832ca/md-1-big-Data.db, /var/lib/cassandra/data/system/compaction_history-b4dbb7b4dc493fb5b3bfce6e434832ca/md-2-big-Data.db]}}
