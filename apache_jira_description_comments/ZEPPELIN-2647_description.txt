I think an administrator would want to see queries a user writes in the situation on trouble shooting.
In private mode, a note book's owner will be set as the user who create the notebook by default, then an administrator cannot see the notebook.

I have an idea to realise the feature.
# Add a new field in configuration file to set default owner
# Set the default owners in the configuration file when user creates new notebook.

If there are any features to realise that things already, please let me know.
