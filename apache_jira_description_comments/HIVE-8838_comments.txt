Hi [~Ferd] did you manage to do any progress on this? I would be happy to take this over.

Hi [~szita], I don't have circle to do this. Feel free to take it over. Thank you!

The 2 failed tests above are unrelated/flaky, so [^HIVE-8838.1.patch] should be fine

[~szita] Can you create code review for this change so people can leave comments?

[~aihuaxu] please see the review [here|https://reviews.apache.org/r/59020]

The patch looks good to me. [~spena] Can you also take a look since you are more familiar with parquet?

Re-patched this fix into [^HIVE-8838.2.patch] due to other changes committed since (e.g. timestamp fix revert).
Reported failures above are unrelated, result looks fine. [~spena] can you take a look please?

+1

Thanks for adding parquet support to HCat! This has been a long time coming. :)

(also, note : I'm ignoring the reported test failures above, since they're all known to be flaky tests, and have been fixed elsewhere. However, we should run unit tests once more, in case there are other code changes in the last 10-ish days. Thus, I'm going to re-upload a .3.patch identical to the .2.patch so that ptest kicks off.)

[~szita] and [~sushanth] How about the tests related to TestHCatClient? Looks like those test failures are related?

[~aihuaxu] those are unrelated, they are flaky/failing without this patch too, see e.g this build from yesterday: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/5937/testReport/

Thanks [~szita] The patch looks good to me. +1.

Thanks all for the reviews. I'll address the minor comments on the RB and will upload a new patch shortly..

[~spena] I've addressed your comments in [^HIVE-8838.4.patch]

Thanks, LGTM

Test results above are irrelevant again - I think this is ready for commit

Thanks [~szita] for your contribution. I committed to master.

([~spena], I just pushed to master too, hopefully our pushes don't conflict :D )

Aaa, that's what happened haha, I tried to push it when I got an error that I had to update my local repo, and when I updated it, I saw the patch was already there, then I got confused.

Anyway, no worries, thanks for the heads up.

Thanks for reviewing [~spena], [~sushanth], [~aihuaxu] and committing!

Does this need any user documentation?

[~leftylev] : Per https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+StorageFormats , it indicates that Parquet support was added in 0.10.0 via a plugin and 0.13.0 natively - that's true for hive, but not for HCatalog itself. This patch finally adds parquet support in HCatalog (as of 3.0.0 :) )

Edit : Actually, Avro support is listed as having been added in 0.9.1, but was added in HCatalog only in 0.14, and orc support itself came only around 0.13 or so in HCatalog, whereas orc was introduced in hive in 0.11 - so all those version numbers in that line refer consistently to the version where support for those formats was added in hive, rather than hcatalog.

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.

Hi all - I’ve been working on backporting the patch 8838.4 onto Hive to allow for parquet tables to be used in versions of Hive *pre* 3.0.0. Would it be best for me to reopen this ticket, or create a new one? [^HIVE-8838.4.patch]

Hi Jay, I guess you could open a new Jira especially if the change for pre Hive 3.0 largely differs from the patch committed here.

If you do so, please make sure to link this Jira as related.

[~szita] - thanks, e've opened a new patch and are in the process of getting it merged at HIVE-22249 (also linked above).
