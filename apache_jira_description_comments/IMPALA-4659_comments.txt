IMPALA-4659: fuzz test fixes

* Apply a 512m mem_limit to all fuzz tests. This limits aggregate memory
  consumption to ~5GB per daemon(assuming 10 concurrent tests).
* Refactor the exec option handling to use the exec_option dimension.
  This avoids executing the test multiple times redundantly
* Remove the xfails to reduce noise, since there is no immediate plan to
  fix the product bugs. Instead just pass the tests.

Testing:
Ran in a loop for ~1h to flush out flakiness.
