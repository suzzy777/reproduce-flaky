[~mambocab] I did write the test, but I don't think I'm going to have the time to look at this within the next week or so. At first glance though, this doesn't look like a problem with the test, but a problem with writing the commit log to disk on windows. Especially the Q replacing the closing brace on the last one.

[~bdeggleston] Thanks for having a look. [~JoshuaMcKenzie] Do you know who else might be able to take this on?

I'll dig into this tomorrow. At the very least we need to confirm whether or not this is a real problem on Windows or just a test problem before we cut the release.
