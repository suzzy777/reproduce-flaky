Changes so far:
- Moved DrainingServerTracker and RegionServerTracker to hbase-server:o.a.h.h.master.
- Moved SplitOrMergeTracker to oahh.master (because it depends on a PB)
- Moving hbase-client:oahh.zookeeper.*  to hbase-zookeeper module.  After [~Apache9]'s cleanup (HBASE-19200), hbase-client doesn't need them anymore (except 3 classes).
- Renamed some classes to use a consistent naming for classes - ZK instead of mix of ZK, Zk , ZooKeeper. Couldn't rename following public classes: MiniZooKeeperCluster, ZooKeeperConnectionException. Left RecoverableZooKeeper for lack of better name. (suggestions?)
- Sadly, can't move tests out because they depend on HBaseTestingUtility (which defeats part of the purpose - trimming down hbase-server tests. We need to promote more use of mocks in our tests)
