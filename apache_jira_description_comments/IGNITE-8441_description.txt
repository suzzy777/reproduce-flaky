Enhance [Ignite Tests 2.4+ (Java 8)|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&tab=projectOverview] project with ability to run build and tests under JDK9. Fix all incoming problems so that full Run All test runs on same branches provide similar results (excluding flaky tests).

Some known problems:
* some current versions of used maven plugins and 3rd party dependencies are still not ready for Java 9
* some JVM options of current test build configurations require revision
* scala -- both 2.10 and 2.11 currently used in building and testing do not support Java 9
