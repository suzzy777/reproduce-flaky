    ZEPPELIN-335: Apache Pig interpreter

    Adds an interpreter for Apache Pig. Based closely on Shell interpreter.
    Assumes that pig client is installed on the same node as Zeppelin (similar to how the Spark interpreter assumes that Spark is installed on Zeppelin node)

    Hi @abajwa-hw,
    Nice improvement...
    I think it would be nice implement the test...;)

    Yes, tests and update for the [docs](http://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/docs/development/howtocontributewebsite.html) will be great to see as part of this PR indeed!
    
    BTW Spark interpreter does not require Spark installed on the same machine with Zeppelin. 
    Depending on the way you [run Zeppelin](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin#setting-spark_home-and-hadoop_home), it can use embedded Spark (actually, by default) so it will work in local mode without any external dependencies.

    Are there plans for pig syntax highlighting similar to what a vim configuration can add? Table/graphing results with this interpreter similar to how the sql interpreter handles results would also be a nice feature

    @abajwa-hw any update? it would be a good additional to Zeppelin

    @abajwa-hw @felixcheung @bzz is the idea to have a pig interpreter dead?
    
    It could be really useful...

    [WIP] ZEPPELIN-335. Pig Interpreter

    ### What is this PR for?
    Based on #338 , I refactor most of pig interpreter. As I don't think the approach in #338 is the best approach. In #338, we use script `bin/pig` to launch pig script, it is different to control that job (hard to kill and get progress and stats info).  In this PR, I use pig api to launch pig script. Besides that I implement another interpreter type `%pig.query` to leverage the display system of zeppelin. For the details you can check `pig.md`
    
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    [Feature]
    
    ### Todos
    * Syntax Highlight
    * new interpreter type `%pig.udf`, so that user can write pig udf in zeppelin directly and don't need to build udf jar manually.
        
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    * https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-335
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    Unit test is added and also manual test is done
    
    ### Screenshots (if appropriate)

Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476
  
    Is it possible have a non-Tez version of Pig and would it work with this interpreter?


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476
  
    Yes, it supports local, mapreduce and tez engine. 


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476
  
    Could you add documentation?



Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476
  
    @felixcheung please check `pig.md`


Github user AhyoungRyu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476
  
    @zjffdu Thanks for your great work! 👍 
    While I was quickly looking through `pig.md`, found some need-to be-changed(?) parts. So I've just pushed my commits to your Zeppelin repo instead of leaving multiple review comments one by one in here. Could you check [https://github.com/zjffdu/zeppelin/pull/2](https://github.com/zjffdu/zeppelin/pull/2) out? :)


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476
  
    Thanks @AhyoungRyu for the help, merged.


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476
  
    how about LICENSE file?


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476
  
    @felixcheung Thanks for the review, license is added and comments are addressed.


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    Thanks, comment replied, in particular, [this](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476#discussion_r82544875)


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476
  
    Do you intent to include the TODO in this PR, or as a follow up?
    Otherwise I think this is good to go - you can remove the WIP in the title and I'll merge if there is no more comment.



Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476
  
    Thanks @felixcheung , Do you know how to run SELENIUM test ? I follow the instruction on READM.MD, but fails 
    ```
    Zeppelin comes with a set of end-to-end acceptance tests driving headless selenium browser
    
    ```sh
    # assumes zeppelin-server running on localhost:8080 (use -Durl=.. to override)
    mvn verify
    
    # or take care of starting/stoping zeppelin-server from packaged zeppelin-distribuion/target
    mvn verify -P using-packaged-distr
    ```


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1476
  
    Try the commandline from Travis?
