GEODE-9758: Add internal serial filter API (#7217)

GEODE-9758: Add internal serial filter API #7217

Expand ObjectInputStreamFilterWrapper to be an internal API which
supports all of Geode's uses of Java's ObjectInputFilter.

Introduce a new system property, geode.enableGlobalSerialFilter, to
enable a process-wide filter with all serializable Geode classes on the 
classpath and the value of serializable-object-filter accept-listed.

To enable the process-wide filter with GFSH start commands, add:

* --J=-Dgeode.enableGlobalSerialFilter=true

Functional Capabilities

The internal API lives in geode-serialization and works on OpenJDK
based JREs providing a facade for Java's ObjectInputFilter in Java 8
and Java 9 or greater using reflection. The API provides the following 
capabilities:

* creating an ObjectInputFilter
* setting an ObjectInputFilter on an ObjectInputStream
* getting an ObjectInputFilter from a ObjectInputStream
* setting a process-wide ObjectInputFilter
* getting a process-wide ObjectInputFilter

Design Notes

The API defines the following primary interface types:

* factory interfaces for creating instances of types within the API
* filter interfaces to split out single ops from Java's
  ObjectInputFilter
* configuration interfaces for handling system properties, logging,
  and config validation

The concrete classes in the API receive parameters injected via a
constructor for any collaborators that are not specified by the
interfaces. This is intentional even when the instance is only used
once before de-referencing it. All collaborators that are defined in
the interface are passed in as parameters to the implementing 
method; all others are passed in via the constructor and stored as 
fields.

I need to work with Dave Barnes to make sure documentation is updated.

GEODE-9817: Enable customized source set paths for ClassAnalysisRule (#7367)

Adds support for customizing source set paths of ClassAnalysisRule.

PROBLEM

Modules external to Geode must be structured the same as Geode
source code in order to use ClassAnalysisRule and the
Analyze*Serializables tests. This is necessary to better facilitate
pluggability of modules that need to provide sanctioned serializable
lists.

SOLUTION

Add source set path customization to ClassAnalysisRule, introduce
a new layer of Analyze*Serializables test base classes that can be
directly extended in order to customize source set paths in
ClassAnalysisRule. Also includes improvements to some iterating
of classes during analysis.

[prereq for backport of GEODE-9980 and GEODE-9758]

Fixed by implementing support for {{-Dgeode.enableGlobalSerialFilter=true}} which will configure a process-wide serialization filter with a filter pattern that allows all Geode and dependency classes. Enabling {{enableGlobalSerialFilter}} will also enable {{validate-serializable-objects}} and the user can add additional classes to the filter pattern using {{serializable-object-filter}}.
