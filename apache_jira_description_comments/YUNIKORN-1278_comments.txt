Is this still the case or has this now been fixed?

It's still an issue, though seems less frequent. Saw it fail on a build yesterday.

ly happens once in a while we can push this into 1.4

Captured the failure so we have something to investigate: based on (approximately) 1.3 code base. Only 1 instance failed all other K8s setup passed
