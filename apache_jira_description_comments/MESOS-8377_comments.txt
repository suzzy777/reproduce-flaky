I couldn't reproduce the issue on my machine with {{--gtest_repeat=1000 --gtest_break_on_failure=1}}, but I suspect that it has something to do with the fact the test uses {{Shared<Replica>}} which probably can still be retained by "managed" {{CatchupProcess}} at the moment when I [try to recreate the replica| https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/src/tests/log_tests.cpp#L2096]. Because of that the DB can not be closed and LevelDB complaints that the process still holds the DB lock. I've added the code to make sure that the test code is the only owner of {{replica3}} before proceeding to recreate it.

    Fixed RecoverTest.CatchupTruncated test flakiness.

    Most likely the "lock already held by process" LevelDB error was caused
    by a Shared<Replica> still retained by one of the processes when the
    test tries to recreate it. This change makes sure that the test code is
    the only owner of the replica.
