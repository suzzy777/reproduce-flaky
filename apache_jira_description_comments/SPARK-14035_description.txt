This JIRA is for tracking slight flakiness in the "Multinomial Naive Bayes" unit test.

We've occasionally seen failures like this:
[https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-2.4/586/consoleFull]
{code}
closeFit(scala.math.`package`.exp(thetaData.apply(i._2).apply(j)), scala.math.`package`.exp(model.theta.apply(i._1).apply(j)), 0.05) was false (NaiveBayesSuite.scala:115)
{code}

I'll send a PR for this JIRA to print out more info, but will leave this JIRA open until the flakiness is fixed.
