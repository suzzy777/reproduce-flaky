Rationale:
- the task seems to be very flaky. In fact, I always need to add '-x :beam-website:testWebsite' to my build [1]
- task uses docker, which imho adds a (unnecessary) severe constraint on the build task. E.g. A part time user is unable to execute these tests in a docker environment
- these tests are accessing production environment. So myself hitting the build several times an hour could be considered a DOS attack.
