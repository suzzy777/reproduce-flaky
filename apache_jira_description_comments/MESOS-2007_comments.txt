Maybe related to MESOS-1536

It looks like just slowness causing authentication to time out.

I'm curious, why the stacktrace? Would like to avoid stacktraces as a result of test failures.

It's still unclear to me but I've seem this issue happen with other tests (e.g. MESOS-2017). I am linking them. 

I propose we mark this ticket closed for the following reasons.  If you feel this is in error, please reopen it with specific details and a way to reproduce the bug. Thanks!

1) Unfortunately, we don't have archives of the Jenkins builds before April 2015, so I don't have any easy way of seeing the exact last time this error occurred. However, we do know it has not cropped up on the Jenkins builds since at least December 2015:

2) As suggested in a related ticket (MESOS-2017), I reset my Mesos tree to:

commit 5d5b65e5722a21868315d80eb05428b11b4d87d0
Author: Adam B <adam@mesosphere.io>
Date:   Mon Oct 13 21:33:11 2014 -0700

    Enabled whitespace/semicolon rule for cpplint.
{noformat}

and ran the following command, trying to trigger both the flaky test error, as well as the "RAW: Pure virtual method called" error.  

GTEST_FILTER="DRFAllocatorTest.DRFAllocatorProcess:ReconciliationTest.TaskStateMismatch:AllocatorTest/0.SlaveReregistersFirst" run-one-until-failure src/mesos-tests --verbose

I ran this test continuously overnight on 2 different setups without error:
– My native Mac OS X setup
– A docker container based on the support/docker_build.sh script in newer Mesoses.


I set up the docker with the following configuration:
COMPILER=clang, CONFIGURATION=--verbose, ENVIRONMENT=GLOG_v=1, MESOS_VERBOSE=1, OS=ubuntu:14.04, label_exp=docker||Hadoop/1638/changes

3) Recently a new ticket with a similar error has cropped up with a similar "RAW: Pure virtual method called" error (MESOS-4604), but we have diagnosed this problem already and it is unrelated to the errors seen in this test (details are in the ticket itself).

Resolved for the same reason as: MESOS-2017
