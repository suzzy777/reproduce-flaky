Apparently sometimes the delete count in ACID stats doesn't match what merger actually returns.
It could be due to some deltas having duplicate deletes from parallel queries (I guess?) that are being squashed by the merger or some other reasons beyond my mortal comprehension.

The loop assumes the merger will return the exact number of records, so it fails with array index exception. Also, it could actually be done in a single loop.
