Blocking on the epoll thread is awful. The new rpc scheduler can have lots of different queues. Those queues have different capacity limits. Currently the dispatch method can block trying to add the the blocking queue in any of the schedulers.

This causes readers to block, tcp acks are delayed, and everything slows down.
