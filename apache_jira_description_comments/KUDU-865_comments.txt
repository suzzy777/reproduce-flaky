Is there a patch alrady up for this one? Seeing it on flaky dashboard in a file different palces (eg client-test.TestScanFaultTolerance too)

[~mpercy] - see above question -- I think this is likely a small patch, so we can still get it done for public beta. Agreed? Should I steal it from you so you can concentrate on your main project?

This also crashed a server on the YCSB cluster. Bumping priority

Yeah I've got an old patch for this, no test though:
