Parquet schema evolution should make it possible to have partitions/tables 
 backed by files with different schemas. Hive should match the table columns with file columns based on the column name if possible.
However if the serde for a table is missing columns from the serde of a partition Hive fails to match the columns together.
Steps to reproduce:
{code}
CREATE TABLE myparquettable_parted
(
  name string,
  favnumber int,
  favcolor string,
  age int,
  favpet string
)
PARTITIONED BY (day string)
STORED AS PARQUET;

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE myparquettable_parted
PARTITION(day='2017-04-04')
SELECT
   'mary' as name,
   5 AS favnumber,
   'blue' AS favcolor,
   35 AS age,
   'dog' AS favpet;

alter table myparquettable_parted
REPLACE COLUMNS
(
favnumber int,
age int
);   <!--- No cascade option, so the partition will not be altered. 
{code}
{{SELECT * FROM myparquettable_parted where day='2017-04-04';}}
will fail with:
{{java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot inspect org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable}}

Hive should either match the columns together or prevent the user from dropping columns from the table.
