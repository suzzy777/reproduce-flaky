This test use `zkLeader.getLastLoggedZxid()` as `lastxid` while it connect to `connectedServer` which maybe different `zkLeader`. There is no happen-before between `zkLeader.getLastLoggedZxid()` and successful response from other server. The commit and response operation is performed asynchronous and branches for different servers. Use `connectedServer.getLastProcessedZxid()` should solve this.

Thank you for the fix, [~kezhuw] !
