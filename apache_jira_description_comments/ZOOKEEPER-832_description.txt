Steps to reproduce:

1.) Connect to a standalone server using the Java client.
2.) Stop the server.
3.) Delete the contents of the data directory (i.e. the persisted session data).
4.) Start the server.

The client now automatically tries to reconnect but the server refuses the connection because the session id is invalid. The client and server are now in an infinite loop of attempted and rejected connections. While this situation represents a catastrophic failure and the current behavior is not incorrect, it appears that there is no way to detect this situation on the client and therefore no way to recover.

The suggested improvement is to send an event to the default watcher indicating that the current state is "session invalid", similar to how the "session expired" state is handled.
