Hey [~jleech] 0.94 is still taking fixes for sure.  Letting out IE will break the API* so a change like this probably can't go into the 0.94 code line but making methods let out IE is something we should allow in the client going forward and something we've talked about with a while (See HBASE-3523)

*Is that right [~eclark]?  You were making point that adding exceptions is ok long as you don't recompile.

stack, org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ipc.HBaseClient.call() already throws InterruptedException at the API level, it just doesn't out of that while loop.

[~jleech] I see.  In trunk, etc., it lets out the IE but not in 0.94.   Chatting w/ [~eclark], adding an exception does not break binary compatibility (as he says, compiling, you'd have to add in the catch, etc.) so you think we could squeeze it in in a way that does not break compatiblity in the 0.94 line?  Thanks.

If all it declares in .94 is IOException, you could catch InterruptedException and throw a java.io.InterruptedIOException (which extends IOException and has been around since Java 1.0)

[~jleech] Yessir.  If going to add an exception, better a broad one.

The trunk will have the issue as well (see RpcCLient#call). As well, if the interrupt is received during the RpcClient#writeRequest, it may be transformed to a IOException (SocketIOWithTimeout#select), and then the connection will be closed (among other events), which may not be what you want.

This said, we should manage interruptions correctly, in the client and in the server code. [~jleech@virtela.net]] Do you plan to propose a patch?

I'm going to do some stuff around this, for .98+ at least.

Hum. While I think the code is globally correct, I'm interested by getting reviews on this. Mixing interrupt with synchronous i/o and asynchronous i/o is not trivial.

{code}
+      if (curRetries >= maxRetries || ExceptionUtil.isInterrupt(ioe)) {
         throw ioe;
{code}
Can InterruptedIOException be thrown in case of interrupt ?

bq. Can InterruptedIOException be thrown in case of interrupt ?
Yes, that's the intend.

The release warning is about the license in one of the new files. I can add this on commit. Any +1 around? 
I would like to commit this on .98 & .99. It does not solve all interruption issues, but it's a step forward already.

This looks like a safe nice improvement.  The IE is not added to a public API though?   That is intentional?  +1

bq. The IE is not added to a public API though?
Yeah, it's always hidden behind the IOException. The JDK (1.7 at least) does like this: the exception is never declared explicitly. This seems to be the most common pattern, even if it's questionable...

I'm about to tag the next RC, will commit this shortly.

Committed to trunk and 0.98. New test passes locally. Should I resolve this issue now?

I can do that ;-).
I will create other jiras for the remaining issues. As written, the test should not be flaky (ping me if necessary), but I know that it does not cover all cases.

Thanks a lot Andrew.

Committed 10337-addendum.patch to trunk and 0.98 which adds missing license headers. Apologies for missing that one the first go around.
