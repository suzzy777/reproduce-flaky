FINERACT-1168 would help a lot to understand the cause of this failure.

I can actually easily reliably locally reproduce this test failure, and locally see that it's due to:

What I don't understand is how the build is green on [https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/branches] with this. I don't see any PRs which were recently merged without green builds that could have broken this. Weird. Anyway.

For a moment I thought this was perhaps an Apache POI update that happened "behind our backs" (sliding updates to latest released), but no, that's not it, we're on fixed POI v4.1.2 - no changes there.

Oh, I've figured it out... :( silly me, this test failure WAS because of [https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1494] (only, and wouldn't happen on develop; I just locally saw it because my DB was "dirty"), because the new-style fineract-client SDK OfficeTest moved for FINERACT-1209 created a TestOffice-... and the {{SavingsWorkbookPopulator}} couldn't handle office names with hyphens. I'll add a commit to the PR to make it pass, but improve {{SavingsWorkbookPopulator}} anyway (and change the title of this issue.

[https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1498] has a fix addressing the underlying problem in ALL *WorkbookPopulator (20 files modified). The same commit is also part of https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1494.
