The test came in recently as part of HBASE-17712 "Remove/Simplify the logic of RegionScannerImpl.handleFileNotFound"

[~Apache9] when you have a chance, help me out. I was going to just remove the test since it made no sense to me but then I saw you wrote it  (smile).

When the region.compact(true); is called on the end, what is supposed to be going on?

When I trace, the compact is not done because the Region is not writeEnabled (we check if Region is writeEnabled down in Store before we go ahead and compact). So, I thought the problem was that the region reference was stale because it came from the rsToSuspend which had just been killed.

After a while, I figured that you intend the region reference to be stale so you can try an append AFTER the WAL has been taken over by WAL splitter.

But the writeEnabled flag is set so compactions don't run. I tried unsetting this flag and closed flags and but compaction won't run.

Was this your intent sir? If so, I'll work w/ it np. Just looking for clarity. Thanks.
