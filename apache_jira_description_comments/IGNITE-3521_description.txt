We have "max space" concept in IGFS which governs maximum amount of local data available for IGFS. This concept looks a bit weird because we do not have the same thing in caches. 
Moreover, we have several conflicting configuration parameters:
1) {{IgfsPerBlockLruEvictionPolicy}} where we also can specify maximum size.
2) {{CacheConfiguration.offheapMaxMemory}} which also governs evictions.

It looks like we should simply remove "max space" property from IGFS configuration and do not control it anyhow.
