IMPALA-11505: Fix flaky test test_kudu_txn_abort_partition_lock

TestKuduTransaction.test_kudu_txn_abort_partition_lock fails as
exception message is unexpected due to timing issue.

This patch added a new debug action so that test code could explicitly
control over calling Commit() for Kudu transaction. Changed the test
to run first query synchronously with new debug action.

Testing:
 - Repeatedly ran test_kudu_txn_abort_partition_lock for 500 times
   in Jenkins without failure.
 - Passed core test.
