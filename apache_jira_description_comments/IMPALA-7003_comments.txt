IMPALA-7003: Deflake erasure coding data loading

Erasure coding data loading is flaky in two ways:
1. HBase sometimes doesn't work because of HBase-19369
2. Nested data loading sometimes fails because the HDFS namenode cannot
   find enough good datanodes.

For problem 1, this patch enables erasure coding only on /test-warehouse
directory. For problem 2, this patch sets
dfs.namenode.redundancy.considerLoad to false, preventing namenode from
excluding heavily-loaded datanodes.

Sorry the Jira number is wrong. The above commits belong to IMPALA-7004.

[~tianyiwang] are you aiming for 3.1 still? If not maybe change the target version to backlog?


I'll just put this on backlog until there is someone to pick it up.

Note that Impala already supports the basic functionality on erasure-coding. It's just turned off by default because Impala lacks metrics, observability and DDL commands related to erasure coding.

You can turn on this feature by setting query option ALLOW_ERASURE_CODED_FILES to true.
