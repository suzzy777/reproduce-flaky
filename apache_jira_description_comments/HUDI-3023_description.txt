Recently, we encountered an issue in integ tests where namenode was not ready yet to receive connections (still in safemode) and hdfs commands in ITTestHoodieDemo setup were not succeeeding. The namenode typically takes some time (2-3 minutes) to come up. While adding a delay is a workaround, it would be better to execute this test after others like ITTestHoodieSyncCommand and ITTestHoodieSanity. With JUnit 5.8 we can order test classes and as we already have a working patch for upgrading junit (https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3748) we should consider ficing the order to avoid flakiness.
