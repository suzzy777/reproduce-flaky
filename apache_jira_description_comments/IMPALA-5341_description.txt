In our planner tests we want to ignore minor differences in reported file sizes to avoid flaky tests, see IMPALA-2565. However, the introduced filter also matches "row-size=" which we do not want to filter.

Relevant code is in TestUtils.java:
{code}
  static class FileSizeFilter implements ResultFilter {
    private final static String BYTE_FILTER = "[KMGT]?B";
    private final static String NUMBER_FILTER = "\\d+(\\.\\d+)?";
    private final static String FILTER_KEY = "size="; <-- also matches "row-size="

    public boolean matches(String input) { return input.contains(FILTER_KEY); }

    public String transform(String input) {
      return input.replaceAll(FILTER_KEY + NUMBER_FILTER + BYTE_FILTER, FILTER_KEY);
    }
  }
{code}
