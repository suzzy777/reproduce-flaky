After discussing with [~greggomann], looks like the segfault happens due to a race during the test tear-down.
The test looks for a particular task status update. A segfault would happen when the scheduler receives another task status update and tries to acknowledge the update, and in between, the scheduler got tear-down.

A possible fix is to kill the task and wait for the task kill status update explicitly before test tear-down.

    Fixed flaky test `MasterAPITest.SubscribersReceiveHealthUpdates`.

    This patch fixes the flaky test by explicitly killing the
    task before test tear-down, avoiding the race condition
    between scheduler tear-down and scheduler getting/acknowledging
    a status update.
