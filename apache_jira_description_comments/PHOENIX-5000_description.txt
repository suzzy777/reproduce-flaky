SecureUserConnectionsTest is marked as unit test even though it starts a MiniKdc as part of its setup. Moreover it is flaky since it fails to find Kerberos realm on Jenkins boxes. Since this unit test fails, it doesn't allow other Integration tests to run.

This Jira is aimed two fold, first to move this to IT and second understand the reason for flakyness.

[~tdsilva] FYI.
