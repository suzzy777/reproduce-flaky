The {{DefaultSourceTest.testRepartition}} test scenario of the {{org.apache.kudu.spark.kudu}} package shows signs of significant flakiness: about 10% of all runs fail, regardless of build configuration (yes, that's a Spark/Java test, but it runs against external mini-cluster).

I'm attaching logs from a few failure cases.
