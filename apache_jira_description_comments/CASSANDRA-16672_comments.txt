Results are a bit noisy... I think I'll run them against circle to doublecheck...

So I think there's nothing obvious broken and we can retag ccm.

+1

Any idea why the following is happening?

{code}
bash-4.2$ pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/riptano/ccm.git@cassandra-test#egg=ccm
Collecting ccm from git+https://github.com/riptano/ccm.git@cassandra-test#egg=ccm
  Cloning https://github.com/riptano/ccm.git (to cassandra-test) to /tmp/pip-build-zytofrkv/ccm

You are using pip version 9.0.1, however version 21.1.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.

python dtest builds are all failing to checkout ccm

[~adelapena] mentioned he had that issue too. I haven't tested it myself but if you say you see it too, it means it wasn't something random. 

Andres managed also to reproduce it locally running {{pip install -r requirements.txt}} in his local python venv. It works after dropping the old copy of the ccm repo that he had in his venv, on the {{src}} dir of the venv. As for CircleCI, it says here that the dependencies are already installed on the Docker image: [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/.circleci/config-2_1.yml#L1109-L1117]

Might be that we need to rebuild the docker image, not sure. As the retagging is just change of hash, no new dependencies added, this is weird. Also, I see CI being run successfully before the commit but seems Berenguer cleaned already his repo and I can't see the commits to verify if something has been missing there.

CASSANDRA-16688  ticket opened. Thinking out loud, I guess there are some specifics around the tags and the CI was run on a custom branch, probably  so not being able to catch this issue. Let's see whether the rebuild will help

[~bereng], I think the latest ccm patch which triggered you to see retag hasn't been recently is still not committed. [~dcapwell] found a workaround which I plan to ninja fix until Monday when we can commit that patch (want to double-check with you whether it should be really committed or you had some concerns), retag CCM and rebuild the docker image (I am positive that will solve the problem). I am also not sure whether I will have the rights to push a new image on docker hub.

[~e.dimitrova] the only reason that CCM patch was not committed yet is that I am going one step at a time, nothing else.

As per the new failure I struggle to make sense of it. As I tested it on circle and it worked. Looking at some dtest job in circle we can see the right SHA and not the tag are being pulled indeed:

{noformat}
Obtaining ccm from git+https://github.com/riptano/ccm.git#egg=ccm (from -r /home/cassandra/cassandra-dtest/requirements.txt (line 9))
  Updating ./env3.6/src/ccm clone
  Running command git fetch -q --tags
  Running command git reset --hard -q 435f3210e16d0b648fbf33d6390d5ab4c9e630d4
{noformat}


I think now we can commit it and retag when we close CASSANDRA-16688. 

It is correction of the debug messages so I think it should be harmless if I don't miss anything. Thank you

Yep the ccm change has been in my TODO list. I was leaving some breathing space to the ccm retagging. I prefer to go one change at a time as it was the first time I was retagging ccm.

I was about to commit that CCM change from CASSANDRA-16644 but there are some build problems today so I'll hold off to next week #justfyi
