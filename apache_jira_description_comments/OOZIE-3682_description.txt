In case someone runs an SSH action which connects from Oozie server (linux) to an AIX host, then the ssh-wrapper process is showing up on the remote host, but it hangs forever.
This happens because the quotes around the callback URL are being retained in the arguments taken by ssh-base and sent to ssh-wrapper, causing an infinite loop.

The goal of this ticket is to track the fix of this issue in the callback mechanism.
