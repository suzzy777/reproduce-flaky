There are several cases when too general expectations can be triggered by related but not targeted events. Examples:
1. Resent task status update before ack due to clock manipulation
2. Advancing clock with {{registration_backoff_factor}} to ensure successful registration might lead to a case where the first agent resends registration request and hence satisfies the expectation for the second agent.

A possible solution would be extensive use of matchers and extra primitives wrapping them. For example, a possible approach to 1. is https://reviews.apache.org/r/63577/
