   do the tests which fail go anywhere near jettison?




pjfanning commented on PR #4937:

   @steveloughran these tests do use jettison so I will need to investigate them. So far, there isn't anything obvious. There are some exceptions in the logs but they are not definitely related to the jettison change. I will continue to look for the cause.

   ### Description of PR
   
   pr #4937 applied to branch-3.3.
