if this is a problem , maybe I can try to fix

Thanks for your interest in this and KAFKA-8059! I left you some comments about how to contribute and conquer the flakiness.

This is a duplicate of KAFKA-4222.

Re-opening to further investigation cc [~cpettitt-confluent]


Moving this to 2.5.0 since PR is not ready yet.  Feel free to change the version, if we want to fix this in 2.4.0.

Checked in a fix for this which may reduce flakiness. Also improved instrumentation so that if this fails again we'll have more context to debug and repro.
