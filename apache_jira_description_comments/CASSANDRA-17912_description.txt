It was noticed that Circle CI pushes to run irrelevant for 3.0 and 3.11 Python upgrade tests. Those are properly skipped in Jenkins.

Example runs:

[CircleCI|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1931/workflows/39ef5261-a6bf-4e77-a412-e750e322a231/jobs/15293] - 3.0 run

[Jenkins|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1944/] - while typing this I actually noticed [one test|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1944/testReport/junit/dtest-upgrade.upgrade_tests.upgrade_through_versions_test/TestProtoV3Upgrade_AllVersions_RandomPartitioner_EndsAt_3_11_X_HEAD/test_parallel_upgrade_with_internode_ssl/] only looking suspicious in Jenkins as it ends the upgrade in 3.11 when we test 3.0... 

This is good to be fixed for two reasons - reduce the noise so we do not miss legit failures and we should not spend resources to try to run those tests.
