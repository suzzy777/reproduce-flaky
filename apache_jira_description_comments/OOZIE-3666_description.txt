We have found a bug in the mechanism of the Oozie log streaming.

Affected code lines: [https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/release-5.2.1/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/service/ZKXLogStreamingService.java#L221L250]
This code is responsible for collating all of the logs from the available Oozie servers.However, in case there is a log message in server "A" with the same timestamp as an other log message in server "B", then according to the current implementation, the logs acquired by using `TimestampedMessageParser` corresponding to server "B" will be overwritten by server "A" 's parser (due to the operation ofÂ {*}{color:#0747a6}timestampMap.put(earliestParser.getLastTimestamp(), earliestParser){color}{*}), therefore causing the log messages from server "B" to be ignored from that point.
