This update introduce flaky tests with something such kind of error:

{code}
Error executing command: org.jline.reader.LineReader.getBuffer()Lorg/jline/reader/impl/BufferImpl;
{code}

It could be a race condition/startup order on Pax Exam. I'm postponing this update to give me time to investigate.

We upgraded to surefire 2.21.0 already.
