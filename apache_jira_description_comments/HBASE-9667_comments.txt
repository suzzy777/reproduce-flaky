The issue is that the javadoc says for nullOutputStream : Since 14.0 (since 1.0 as com.google.common.io.NullOutputStream)
So we would have to upgrade to guava 14 and people will be able to use guava 15, but then people using version 11 will have to upgrade, upgrade their third parties that depends on that old version.

For 0.94 it seems to be an issue. For 0.96 it is possible, if it doesn't mess with hadoop common who uses guava as well.
Note that the issue may be less critical in 0.96: the code using NullOutputStream is in hbase-server, not hbase client, so upgrading guava would work.

The other option being to stop using both NullOutputStream and nullOutputStream. This would work in 0.94 as well.

btw, [~mdgreenfield], what's the version of HBase you're using? I don't see NullOutputStream  referenced in HFileWriterV2 in 0.94 head.

I was wrong, some of them are in hbase-common, so visible from the client. So the issue is real in .96 as well. Marking critical.

If I can rely on http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/ReleaseHistory, these guava guys are not joking: v13 was in august 2012; in v14 (feb 1013) they deprecated a feature and offered and replacement. In September 2013 they removed the old feature => it's impossible to have a client depending on 3 versions that came into just a year. If it's confirmed, we will have to pay extra attention each time we use this library, this is just not compatible with our timeframes.

So I found 3 compilation issue when using guava 15:
- NullOutputStream -> there is one in org.apache.hadoop.io. Easy.
- LimitInputStream -> copy paste into hbase code base. Their Apache license allows that.
- MapMaker -> Replaced with a concurrent map. See http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/MapMakerMigration: ??At first glance this behavior is tremendously useful, but the specific implementation of this functionality behind a plain ConcurrentMap was riddled with issues. Having a Map that auto-creates entries on get was simply a big mistake.?? Pinging [~eclark] on this one as it may have in impact on performances.

The patch is with guava 15 to check how it behaves, but I plan to keep the current version in our pom as hadoop 2.1 is on v11.0.2 (which is far too old as well, but imho it's better to limit the gap for the moment).

Note that nothing guarantees us that we won't break our compatibility with guava 15 in a later patch.

TestAsyncProcess.testThreadCreation is a flaky test I fixed in HBASE-9676.
javadoc tool appears to have generated 1 warning messages: seems unrelated. 
-1 release audit.  I forgot the Apache license in v1. Fixed in v2.

So it seems that it works well with Guava 15. Version v2 fixed the warning above w/o changing the guava version.

Hadoop branch 2 does have the same problems as hbase, but only on Journal and in the tests. So we will be fine.

[~nkeywal], we are running 0.94.6 (0.94.6-cdh4.3.0-00018943 to be exact)

Any +1 on this one?

Looking right now.

Patch looks good.
{code}
+ * allows to be compatible with guava 15 to 15.
{code}
Should the first 15 be 14 ?

bq. Should the first 15 be 14 ?
11 to 15 actually. I will fix this on commit.

+1

ExactCounterMetric will be deprecated in 0.96 and is completely un-used to my knowledge.  We should remove it in trunk, but this should make 0.96 more flexible.  Thanks

Thanks for the reviews, Ted & Elliott. Actually, NullOutputStream is not available in hadoop branch 1.0. While trunk depends on 1.2, 0.96 is still with 1.0.4, so I need to include this class as well...

with the NullOutputStream from common-io at the end.

committed to trunk & .96, thanks Elliott & Ted.

Given this was reported on 0.94.x, are we going to have a patch for that ? Or should I just create one based on the files that are modified here and attach it here ?
