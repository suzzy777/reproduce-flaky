I'd guess that it is a duplicate of ZEPPELIN-2656, but with a little bit of debug on top of the bug. 

the list of available visualizations is defined by this code:
{code}
  <div ng-if="type == 'TABLE' || type == 'NETWORK'" class="btn-group">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-sm"
            ng-repeat="viz in builtInTableDataVisualizationList track by $index"
            ng-if="viz.supports.indexOf(type) > -1"
            ng-class="{'active' : viz.id == graphMode && !config.helium.activeApp}"
            ng-click="switchViz(viz.id)"
            tooltip-placement="bottom" uib-tooltip="{{viz.name ? viz.name : ''}}"
            ng-bind-html="viz.icon">
    </button>
  </div>
{code}

this check: {{ng-if="viz.supports.indexOf(type) > -1"}} make it impossible for the helium visualization to appear in this list because they do not have anything in the {{supports}}. I guess helium visualizations should also have an array of supported types, but in my case it is indefined. Not even empty.
