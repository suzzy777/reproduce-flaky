As a part of our current testing infrastructure, some packages can get installed under .eggs/. This install is racey (unlike installing via pip), and recently has become very racey with the addition of setup_requires (for pytest) and tests_require (for interactive runner).

Removing the setup_requires and tests_require sections from setup.py should mitigate flakiness.
