See [Flaky Tests|https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/HBase/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/job/master/161/console], some UTs about replication failed cause timeout.

In [HBaseInterClusterReplicationEndpoint.sleepForRetries|https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/78ae1f176d4215dcc34067ed25d786a4fcd4d888/hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/replication/regionserver/HBaseInterClusterReplicationEndpoint.java#L203], InterruptedException is caught but no further processing, the interrupted status of the current thread is cleared.

Below is the code comment of Thread.sleep.
{code:java}
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @throws  InterruptedException
 *          if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
 *          <i>interrupted status</i> of the current thread is
 *          cleared when this exception is thrown.
 */
public static native void sleep(long millis) throws InterruptedException;
{code}
So InterruptedException must be processed, otherwise ReplicationSourceShipper thread cannot be terminated in some cases.
