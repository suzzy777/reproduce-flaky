I think no. It seems the existing search is checking if the IP is in the {{source}} column, given that is where we find {{' $IP '}}. Also, given the semantics of the test (running at CL.ALL), I would expect to see results from 127.0.0.2 in there. We are missing expected trace output here.

So there is nothing wrong in the logs for this build, and this test has never failed on any other job ever. I marked it as flaky in the code, and I'll run it a few hundred times to see if I can get it to fail again usefully.

The bad news is, this seems isolated to 2.1, or at least, isn't on trunk:

http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized_dtest_multiplexer/71/

Doesn't happen on 2.2. Definitely a 2.1 only problem.

So, to persist what I've said on IRC here:

The entire request is completing, at CL.ALL appropriately. We see the coordinator trace that it has received the response from each node. But sometimes we get no trace messages from 127.0.0.2 (and only *ever* 127.0.0.2, never 127.0.0.3). This only ever happens on 2.1. I have run it hundreds of times on 2.1, 2.2, and 3.5. Is this something that where we are relying on tracing to do something it cannot? The specificity of the issue is suspicious. I'm moving this to the bug queue, so that a dev can authoritatively say "This should work", or "This should not work".

We definitely _should_ be getting trace entries from the 127.0.0.2 node, but it _is_ responding to the request and everything else looks normal.  So, this problem seems to be isolated to tracing.  Given that this is only a problem on 2.1 and we're only making critical fixes to 2.1 now, I think it's best to simply skip this test on 2.1.  Spending too much time digging into 2.1 tracing quirks isn't worth it.

Do you agree, [~philipthompson]?
