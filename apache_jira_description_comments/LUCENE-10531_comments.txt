I have little time for this right now, I'll take a look sometime soon.

It shouldn't be slow at least on a physical machine (on VMs, we observed it can be slow (~1min) maybe because of the cpu/memory budgets assigned to the VM?). Meanwhile, I feel like it shouldn't be included in the mandatory tests suite since it's unlikely to be affected by the changes in other modules - I'd prefer to catch the launching problems on nightly CI runs.

Fine with me.
