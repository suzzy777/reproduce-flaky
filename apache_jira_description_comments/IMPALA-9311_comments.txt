Thanks for creating the JIRA. In my local tests, hms always returned the primary keys in the reverse order of their definition. Obviously there is some inconsistency here. I will dig deeper into the HMS code to see if there is a specific pattern. If not, this could make a bunch of catalog tests that I wrote for PK/FK also flaky.

IMPALA-9311: Store SQLPrimaryKeys in canonical order.

HMS seems to be returning SQLPrimaryKeys in inconsistent orders.
This makes some of the primary keys tests flaky. This change sorts
the list of primary keys and stores them in canonical order within
Impala.

Testing:
- Modified the tests that were relying on HMS to return same order
  every time.
- Ran parametrized job.
