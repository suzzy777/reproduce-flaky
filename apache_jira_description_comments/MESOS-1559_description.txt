Many of the time, when jenkins build times out, we know that some test freezes at some place. However, most of the time, it's very hard to reproduce the deadlock on dev machines.

I would be cool if we can dump the stack traces of all threads when jenkins build times out. Some command like the following:

{noformat}
echo thread apply all bt > tmp; gdb attach `pgrep lt-mesos-tests` < tmp
{noformat}
