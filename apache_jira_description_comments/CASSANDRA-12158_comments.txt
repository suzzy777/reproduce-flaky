This is almost certainly because {{thrift_tests.py}} moved to the ReusableClusterTest with [PR 1065|https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/1065]. Flakiness depends on test order execution, since the extra keyspaces' existence depends on order of test method execution. We could drop any potential extra keyspaces at the beginning of {{test_describe_keyspace}}.

Oh, that is most definitely the problem and needed fix.
