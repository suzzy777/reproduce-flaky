This might be it:

{noformat}
from random import choice
{noformat}

{noformat}
      cls.TestMatrix.add_constraint(lambda v: v.get_value('query') ==\
          choice(QUERIES.keys()))
{noformat}

[~jbapple], this is fixed right?


IMPALA-4818: Ensure the same number of tests are run every time

This is a partial revert of Change-Id: I04b4d6db508a26a1a2e4b972b...
from January 2014. That commit caused test_cancel_insert to run
different random tests each time it was run; the number of tests run
could vary between 1 and 9. This commit fixes the number at 9, and the
same 9 every time, to avoid test flakiness.
