bq. When avail >= amount, avail can't be refill. 
Correct, it should not.

bq. So avail will waste some time to refill.
Call will go to refill only when available is consumed completely.

bq. we use smaller rate than the limit, the canExecute will return false.
When we consume all the available resources then we will have to wait until {{RateLimiter#waitInternal()}} return 0, then only we will be able to execute next request.

If I am missing something, can you demonstrate the scenario you have mentioned using a test case. For reference you can use {{TestRateLimiter}}.

Think this scenario, we have one RateLimter  which limit=10000 per seconds and the client want to have about 6000 resources/sec.
{code}
                RateLimiter limiter = new RateLimiter();
		limiter.set(10000, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // set 10000 resources/sec
		limiter.consume(10000); // initialize the limiter to have no available resources

		long lastTs = System.currentTimeMillis();
		while (true) {
			// client want get  about 6000 resources per seconds
			Thread.sleep(1);
			for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
				long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
				boolean canExecute = limiter.canExecute(now, lastTs);
				if (!canExecute) {
					System.out.println("rejected");
					Thread.sleep(limiter.waitInterval());
				}
				limiter.consume();
				lastTs = now;
			}
		}
{/code}
Test the above code, we will get a lot rejected in the console. Or you can add the assertTrue(canExecute). But the real is canExecute maybe false.
The key point is "lastTs". The code update lastTs every consume, but don't refill the limiter. So a 10000 resources/sec limiter will reject the 6000 resources/sec request.
You maybe confused about why the code update lastTs every consume. See TimeBasedLimiter. When grabQuota, it update lastTs(writeLastTs or ReadLastTs).

in your code, shouldn't now be updated after thread.sleep()?

also, did you see how the RateLimiter is used inside TestRateLimiter and TimeBasedLimiter? why are you using it directly?

1. In my code, now will be updated in every request. This code is just for test shortly.
2. RateLimiter will be used in TimeBasedLimiter. TimeBasedLimiter will be used in DefaultOperationQuota. When DefaultOperationQuota.checkQuota(), it will call TimeBasedLimiter.checkQuota() then call TimeBaseLimiter.grabQuota().  TimeBasedLimiter.checkQuota() will update now and lastTs, then call RateLimiter.canExecute(). TimeBaseLimiter.grabQuota() will call RateLimiter.consume() and update lastTs(writeLastTs or ReadLastTs).

my code is just for test the above step shortly.....

{quote}1. In my code, now will be updated in every request. This code is just for test shortly.{quote}
yeah, you update now at the beginning of the for loop, but you pass lastTs to the checkExecute() and lastTs was not updated with the sleep time (you should update now with sleep time before assigning now to lastTs at the end of the for) otherwise your check is against an old time that does not include your sleep, so that will not refill, because for the RateLimiter you didn't do a sleep

Did you mean add "now = System.currentTimeMillis(); " after "Thread.sleep(limiter.waitInterval());"? 

yes

I test again. The code will output a lot of "rejected". When the limit is 10000 and a client want get 6000 resources per sec, canExecute (canExecute = limiter.canExecute(now, lastTs);) should always be ture. But in this code, canExecute maybe false.

This is a new TestCase in TestRateLimiter.
{code}
  @Test 
  public void testLimiterBySmallerRate() throws InterruptedException {
    RateLimiter limiter = new RateLimiter();
    // set limiter is 10 resources per seconds
    limiter.set(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    long lastTs = System.currentTimeMillis();
    int count = 0; // control the test count
    while ( (count++) < 100) {
      // test will get 3 resources per 0.5 sec. so it will get 6 resources per sec.  
      Thread.sleep(500);
      for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        long nowTs = System.currentTimeMillis();
        // 6 resources/sec < limit, so limiter.canExecute(nowTs, lastTs) should be true
        assertEquals(true, limiter.canExecute(nowTs, lastTs));
        limiter.consume();
        lastTs = nowTs;
      }
    }
  }
{code}

[~zghaobac]
Thanks for the test case.
As per the current code implementation of {{RateLimiter}} what I have understand is, if your limit is set for 10resources/sec, then you will be able to consume one resource every 0.1sec. So if we modify your test case like below it will always pass.
{code}
@Test
  public void testLimiterBySmallerRate() throws InterruptedException {
    RateLimiter limiter = new RateLimiter();
    // set limiter is 10 resources per seconds
    limiter.set(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    long lastTs = System.currentTimeMillis();
    int count = 0; // control the test count
    while ((count++) < 100) {
      // test will get 3 resources per 0.5 sec. so it will get 6 resources per sec.
      Thread.sleep(125);
      // for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) {
      long nowTs = System.currentTimeMillis();
      // 6 resources/sec < limit, so limiter.canExecute(nowTs, lastTs) should be true
      assertEquals(true, limiter.canExecute(nowTs, lastTs));
      limiter.consume();
      lastTs = nowTs;
      // }
    }
  }
{code}

I don't think so. As your understand, 60 resources per minute will equal to 1 resources per sec. So the RateLimiter  doesn't need so many TimeUnit.
If user set quota is 60 resources per minute, the RateLimiter can't be effected by the distribution of request.  The user can get 60 resources in the first sec of one minute or get 60 resources in the last sec of one minute. As long as user's request rate is samller than 60 in one minute, the RateLimiter should guarantee the request canExecute.

bq.  As long as user's request rate is samller than 60 in one minute, the RateLimiter should guarantee the request canExecute.
Yes, I totally understand that and even we have internally thought about it. We are internally discussing on this to get to a conclusion.

The RateLimiter can be considered as a leaky bucket (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket). It will refill itself as a limit rate. So lastTs should be one property of RateLimiter and initialize when new RateLimiter(). When refill, RateLimiter will update lastTs to now by itself and avail will be refill to limit at most. 

[~zghaobac], [~mbertozzi] and others can you please review the patch.

Regarding the implementation.
1. I could not find a way to combine the refill logic implemented by AverageIntervalRefillStrategy and FixedIntervalRefillStrategy so I have added a interface RefillStrategy which defines how the RateLimiter will refill the resources availability.
2. Added a new configuration property {{hbase.quota.refill.strategy}}, where in user can configure the refill strategy he/she wants to use. With default being AverageIntervalRefillStrategy.
3. Created a conf object in TimeBasedLimiter, could not a find a better way to pass this object. If you know any other way then please suggest.
4. With this implementation the timestamps in not in client control, instead will be controlled by the refill strategy.
5. I have commented the test for Minutes, Hours, Days in TestRateLimiter, as to verify these test cases will involve high time sleep to refill as timestamps are not in client control.
If you feel the class or methods can be better documented then please suggest, I am happy to do that.

[~ashish singhi] Thanks for your patch.
{code}
    long delta = (limit * (now - refillTime)) / intervalInMillis;
    if (delta > 0) {
      return nextRefillTime.compareAndSet(refillTime, now) ? Math.min(limit, available + delta) : 0;
    }
{code}
if limit and available is Long.MAX_VALUE, when delta > 0, available + delta will be negative. The return value will be negative. Although "check positive overflow" can catch this case.
In my opinion, move "check positive overflow" in refill method maybe better. And the refill should return the new avail, not the refillAmount.
Welcome to discuss about that.

Thanks [~zghaobac] for reviewing the patch.

bq. if limit and available is Long.MAX_VALUE, when delta > 0, available + delta will be negative
When can this case occur ? I can think of only one scenario, that is client executing canExecute for the first time where nextRefillTime will still be equal to default value i.e., -1 and that case is been already handled by below code.
{code}
    if (refillTime == -1) {
      // Till now no resource has been consumed.
      this.nextRefillTime.compareAndSet(nextRefillTime.get(), EnvironmentEdgeManager.currentTime());
      return limit;
    }
{code}

bq. refill should return the new avail, not the refillAmount
Why you think so ? the new avail value will be calculated based on this refillAmount in the canExecute which I thought is ok.

I will fix the check style warnings in the next patch. Waiting for the feedback on the patch.

[~mbertozzi] can you please review the patch. I would also like to hear from you as you being the main developer of this feature.

Assume there is a RateLimiter which limit and avail is Long.MAX_VALUE. Then consume(1). The avail will be Long.MAX_VALUE - 1. After a long time, canExecute(1) again.  This will refill again. The delta will be much greater than 1. Then available + delta will be negative.
bq. Why you think so ? the new avail value will be calculated based on this refillAmount in the canExecute which I thought is ok.
Yeah, your code is ok. But as the below code shows, if refill return the new avail, the code in canExecute will be very simple to understand. Different refill strategy can refill the avail by themselves. The canExecute() should not to handle the special case of refillStrategy.
{code}
    return refillStrategy.refill(limit, avail) >= amount;
{code}

The work of refillStrategy.refill is to give the number of resources that are refilled and that can then be checked and added to the existing avail to form a new avail.

bq. The canExecute() should not to handle the special case of refillStrategy
All the special case of refillStrategy is handled by themselves in {{refill}} method {{canExecute}} has only the code which will be common to all the refillStrategy after they finish calculating the refill amount and can avoid duplicating the code.

{quote}
This you have already answered in your first comment that **"check positive overflow" can catch this case**. So I feel better to leave this piece of code in {{canExecute}} only and avoid duplicating this code in each refill method as of now.

I do not see any strong reason to move this code in {{refill}} of each {{RefillStrategy}}

can you post the patch on review board, it is not short. so it will be easier to review there.

can we lose one level and maybe some fields? having the RateLimiter extended by RefillStrategy or similar. we are going to have tons of those objects around if you starting configuring it by user.
what is the point of the AtomicLong in refill strategy we are under lock when we call that code.
can we go back to external times? otherwise tests must sleep, and aside the slowness they will be always flaky

Thanks [~mbertozzi] for reviewing the patch.

bq. what is the point of the AtomicLong in refill strategy we are under lock when we call that code.
Will address this in my next patch.

bq. can we go back to external times? otherwise tests must sleep, and aside the slowness they will be always flaky
Yes, I can create a api visible only for testing and avoid sleep.

bq. we are going to have tons of those objects around if you starting configuring it by user.
As per the patch, one RateLimiter will have one RefillStartegy object based on the configuration. Can you give more details on this.

bq. can we lose one level and maybe some fields? having the RateLimiter extended by RefillStrategy or similar.
RateLimiter uses RefillStrategy to find the new refill amount and calculate the new available amount based on it. Or may be what other thing I can think off is to have RateLimiter a abstract class and then have other two class AverageIntervalRateLimiter and FixdIntervalRateLimiter extending this class. Then user can decide which RateLimiter he/she wants to use.

In this patch the refill strategy conf is at system level. I think we should allow user to configure this for each quota setting, I will do this in a separate jira and can discuss more on this in that jira.

I have uploaded the existing patch in the RB https://reviews.apache.org/r/34531/, to capture other comments you have on this patch in my next patch.

bq. we are going to have tons of those objects around if you starting configuring it by user.
I thinks this means there will be tons of RateLimiter. So we will have tons of RefillStrategy, too.
bq. Or may be what other thing I can think off is to have RateLimiter a abstract class and then have other two class AverageIntervalRateLimiter and FixdIntervalRateLimiter extending this class.
Good idea. Two name for you: FixedRateLimiter and BurstAllowedRateLimiter. When refill by fixed interval, this means the users' request rate must slow than the limit. But when refill by every average interval, sometimes the users' burst request rate wiil be allowed. The burst request rate which can be allowed is (avail + limit) per intervalInMillis. 

Updated the patch as per the comments and uploaded the same on RB.
In this {{RateLimiter}} is an abstract class and {{AverageIntervalRateLimiter}}  and {{FixedIntervalRateLimiter}} are extending it.
[~zghaobac] I did not keep the AverageIntervalRateLimiter  as BurstAllowedRateLimiter, as I felt the former was straight forward name to get a hint what the class will do. Hope you don't mind.

Please review.

Also I am not sure whether the v1 patch will be acceptable for branch-1.1 !

+1 looks good to me

Thanks for the review.
Can we commit this?

refill in AverageIntervalRateLimiter.
{code}
if (nextRefillTime == -1) {
      // Till now no resource has been consumed.
      nextRefillTime = EnvironmentEdgeManager.currentTimeMillis();
      return limit;
}
{code}
If set the RateLimiter is 10 res per minute. In the first minute, we can consume 30 res (10 from avail, 10 from above "return limit", 10 from refill).
nextRefillTime should be one property of RateLimiter and initialized when new RateLimiter.

bq. If set the RateLimiter is 10 res per minute. In the first minute, we can consume 30 res (10 from avail, 10 from above "return limit", 10 from refill).
How ? In this case refill will return 10. Then if you check the logic of RateLimiter#canExceute(long), available will calculated using below code in this case
{code}
avail = Math.max(0, Math.min(avail + refillAmount, limit));
{code}
So in the first minute the calculation will be like avail = Math.max(0, Math.min(10+ 10, 10)); as per this avail be equal to 10.

Thanks. It can handle the case.

Can anyone help to commit this!
