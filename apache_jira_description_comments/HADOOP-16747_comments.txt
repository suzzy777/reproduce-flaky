Example scripts in the document such as https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/RackAwareness.html and https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-streaming/HadoopStreaming.html#Hadoop_Aggregate_Package should be also updated ;)

Bulk update: moved all 3.3.0 non-blocker issues, please move back if it is a blocker.

Resolved all the sub-tasks. Closing.
