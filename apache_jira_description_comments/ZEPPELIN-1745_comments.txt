    For other reviewers 
    
    - If you are using git 2.10+, Notebook revision feature will not work. Checkout [ZEPPELIN-1737](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1737)


Github user khalidhuseynov commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1775
  
    @1ambda actually i've tried to reproduce [ZEPPELIN-1737](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1737) and even with git 2.11.0 wasn't able to do it. also from documentation [here](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation/RelNotes) only from 2.11.0 `--allow-empty` commits was introduced, meaning only git versions 2.11+ could be a problem which is the most recent version and can be built from the source only for now. So I think reviewing this PR wouldn't much depend on git version, and [ZEPPELIN-1737](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1737) will be addressed separately.

    FYI - you can install 2.11.0 using brew. 
    
    @khalidhuseynov is right, that should be handled in the separate issue. Let's talk about it on ZEPPELIN-1737.


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1775
  
    Works well as described. Here are few things to consider.
    
    - It would be great if there is a signal (whatever) so let user know that this is committed version of note. It's confusing at first for me. 
    - Enabling and modifying committed notes affects on the HEAD note. What about disabling **double click**  to committed paragraphs (you can check this in screenshot below)

    - the last one is not directly related with this issue. But It would be good to hide git notebook related icons if we are not using `GitNotebookRepo`

    @1ambda thanks for review. answers in order: 
    > It would be great if there is a signal (whatever) so let user know that this is committed version of note. It's confusing at first for me. (Assume that someone get the link for a committed note. He might wonder why he can not modify this note)
    
    yeah that's good point, do you have something in mind regarding it? i was thinking whether it should be more of a mode switch (say different mode added in addition to report mode, etc)  or just represent visually (say gray out editor background like when running note), or something else.
    
    > Enabling and modifying committed notes affects on the HEAD note. What about disabling double click to committed paragraphs (you can check this in screenshot below)
    
    thanks for testing, addressed under 50e1472957446f7f907e2ea8b8eb19f4347eac8b. please check it out.
    
    > the last one is not directly related with this issue. But It would be good to hide git notebook icons if we are other notebook repo rather than GitNotebookRepo. 
    
    actually we have issue regarding this one to have `GitNotebookRepo` as default repo, in that case we don't need to hide it i believe.

    Tested this branch and found
    
    1. select HEAD 
    2. and then switch to any revision. 
    3. change height of graph or change pivot setting
    4. HEAD is changed by 3)
    
    @khalidhuseynov could you check scenario above?


Github user khalidhuseynov commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1775
  
    @Leemoonsoo thanks for testing, right i could reproduce it. So in that case probably it shouldn't be allowed to change graph properties or pivot settings while viewing revisions, right? because otherwise it's changing `note.json`

    We might use css transparent property to let user know this paragraphs are readonly like in running interpreters

    Also [CI logs](https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/187629252/log.txt) seems to be failing only in selenium profile with flaky test from [ZEPPELIN-1836](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1836).


Github user AhyoungRyu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1775
  
    @khalidhuseynov How about disable "Interpreter binding" & "Note permission" buttons as well? Currently I can change the bound interpreters and note permission for the readonly-mode note. 


Github user khalidhuseynov commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1775
  
    @AhyoungRyu actually i thought about it and couldn't find a reason why not let user change "Interpreter bindings" and "Note permissions" even in read-only mode, since they're still not able to run or edit. Do you think it's not common sense and confusing? Let me know what you think and we can change that easily. I wasn't also sure about it

    @khalidhuseynov 
    >since they're still not able to run or edit
    
    Yes you're right. I just thought it's not common sense as you told. Since the user can't run or edit anyway, but he can do sth in interpreter binding page and note permission setting page. That's why I suggested to block those features by disabling the icon buttons. 


Github user khalidhuseynov commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1775
  
    @AhyoungRyu I think it makes sense and addressed your feedback. please check it out and let me know if it's fine.
