It will be useful to have some functions to conver unix time values into C* native types, like:

*     {{toDate(bigint)}} 
*     {{toTimestamp(bigint)}}
*     {{mintimeuuid(bigint)}}
*     {{maxtimeuuid(bigint)}}

+Additional info for newcomers:+

Those new functions need to be added to {{org.apache.cassandra.cql3.functions.TimeFcts}} and some unit tests need to be added to {{org.apache.cassandra.cql3.functions..TimeFctsTest}}. The other functions in {{TimeFcts}} provide some good example of how to create new functions.
As it is a new functionality they need to be mentioned in the {{NEWS.txt}} file.
