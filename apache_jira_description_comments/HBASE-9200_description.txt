When one specifies 'printStats' option to HFilePrettyPrinter one of the findings in the report is key row key of the largest row in HFile. Due to a bug it prints in correct row.

{noformat}
      if (curRowBytes > maxRowBytes && prevKV != null) {
        biggestRow = prevKV.getRow();
      }
{noformat}

Above piece should update maxRowBytes to curRowBytes.
