After this commit:
7d4bb49264b IGNITE-12329 Invalid handling of remote entries causes partition desync and transaction hanging in COMMITTING state.

the following tests:
org.apache.ignite.internal.processors.cache.distributed.dht.GridCacheColocatedDebugTest#testPutsMultithreadedColocated
org.apache.ignite.internal.processors.cache.distributed.dht.GridCacheColocatedDebugTest#testPutsMultithreadedMixed
started to be flaky because their ordered putAll operations started deadlocking.

This is a regression compared to 2.7 and should be fixed, since it may affect production clusters.
