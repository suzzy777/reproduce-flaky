Test

org.apache.spark.scheduler.ReplayListenerSuite.End-to-end replay with compression is failed  see [https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-3.2/267/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.scheduler/ReplayListenerSuite/End_to_end_replay_with_compression/]

 

And also the test is failed on arm instance, I sent email to spark-dev before, and we suspect there is something related with the commit [https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23767], we tried to revert it and the tests are passed:

ReplayListenerSuite:
       - ...
       - End-to-end replay *** FAILED ***
         "[driver]" did not equal "[1]" (JsonProtocolSuite.scala:622)
       - End-to-end replay with compression *** FAILED ***
         "[driver]" did not equal "[1]" (JsonProtocolSuite.scala:622) 

 

Not sure what's wrong, hope someone can help to figure it out, thanks very much.
