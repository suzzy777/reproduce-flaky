Seems a split operation which we expect to success is started before we finishing a merge and cause an infinite sleep loop.

I guess the problem is here
{code:title=TestNamespaceAuditor.java}
    // merge the two regions
    admin.mergeRegions(hris.get(0).getEncodedNameAsBytes(),
      hris.get(1).getEncodedNameAsBytes(), false);
    
    while (admin.getTableRegions(tableTwo).size() == initialRegions) {
      Thread.sleep(100);
    }
{code}
I guess that during a merge, we can get more region count than before because we first online the new region and then offline the two old regions.
So change it to admin.getTableRegions(tableTwo).size() != initialRegions - 1 may work.

And we can modify the while loop to use Waiter.waitFor which can provide more useful information when test failed.
