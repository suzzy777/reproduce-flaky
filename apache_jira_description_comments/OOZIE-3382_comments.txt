Looks like {{TestBufferDrainer}} is flaky.

Thank you [~asalamon74] for creating this patch! Can you please check the cause of the flakiness of the test?

+1 from my side for this approach

Can you please summarise here as well in a comment your ideas about the other two solutions (making it configurable via a parameter; having the buffer size half of the oozie.servlet.CallbackServlet.max.data.len).

As we discussed, it would be nice to make some cleanup around the TestSshActionExecutor as well, and include it in our Junit runs.

[~kmarton] Thanks for checking.

I prefer this approach because it does not require the introduction of a new parameter:

* It would be possible to misconfigure the new parameter. For instance specifying a large value for {{oozie.servlet.CallbackServlet.max.data.len}} and low value for the new parameter. Or specifying large value for the new parameter.
* I don't find the new parameter intuitive. It requires to understand the inner details of the Ssh action's buffer draining.

I've opened a JIRA fo the {{TestSSh*}} tests: OOZIE-3391

I'll check the flakiness of the test.

The new patch fixes the flakiness.

The latest patch does not modify ShellMain, because of the {{Process#waitFor}} usage ( OOZIE-3359 ). I'll check the code if it's possible to modify the code and eliminate {{Process#waitFor}} at the same time.

Created a separate Jira to handle {{ShellMain}} modification.

[~asalamon74] thanks for the works, it's a very neat improvement to SSH action.

In general, a nice approach and pretty good test coverage. Most of my comments on RB point towards better readability / maintainability.

I'd extend the test coverage by adding:
* slow processes that drain up till several seconds
* processes that don't drain on a linear scale, but after a while streams get paused and then resumed w/ random pause times
* drain a couple of processes at a time in different threads, and see whether all of those finish correctly
* randomly failing while draining some parallel processes
