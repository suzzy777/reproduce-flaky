[~kou] [~emkornfield@gmail.com] is this still an issue?

Yes in ci/appveyor-cpp-build-mingw.bat:

ctest ^
  --exclude-regex "arrow-array-test|arrow-thread-pool-test" ^
  --output-on-failure ^
  --parallel 2 || exit /B

I couldn't reproduce this on local environment.
So there is no progress.

They have been reenabled in ARROW-5185.

We sill disable these tests:
https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/ci/appveyor-cpp-build-mingw.bat#L64

Ah, sorry. Might be worth making the issue description more precise then :-)

No problem.
I've updated the description.

AFAIK we've moved the mingw tests to GHA where we don't have disabled tests.

So closing it, [~kou] please reopen if it is still valid.
