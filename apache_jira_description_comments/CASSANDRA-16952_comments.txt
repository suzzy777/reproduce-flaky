These should probably have distinct tickets despite sharing the same error.  On that note, it is worth mentioning that timeouts are often environmental and [jenkins|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/713/testReport/dtest.bootstrap_test/history/] does not have any failures in its history for the bootstrap test (the only one I checked.)

I agree with what you said [~brandon.williams], shall we close this ticket? 

I think that is best since I'm not sure how actionable this ticket can be.

Have you created the two issues instead of this one as it was suggested? Otherwise I don't really understand the point of closing it. It contains information about the issue(s), which, I guess, should be enough to proceed with each of them. I also don't follow how having two reports in one ticket prevent to start investigating one of them. A separate ticket can be opened for another later.

Hey [~k-rus], sorry, I wasn't clear. I think we spent so much time on tests fixing that we started to understand each other with two words and just handle quickly certain tickets/issues without giving enough context to others. Something we need to do better.

{{test_multiple_repair}} of {{repair_tests.incremental_repair_test.TestIncRepair is [stable|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/791/testReport/dtest-large-novnode.repair_tests.incremental_repair_test/] in Jenkins.}}

I [ran it 1000 times in Circle CI|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1163/workflows/16b60bae-caa5-4ede-938b-6dd3fa7bb3c9/jobs/6809] and it timed out 4 times.

{{test_simultaneous_bootstrap is also stable in Jenkins and here it is [1000 times completed successfully|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1162/workflows/dfe5ad1e-b46c-415e-b91c-f2fc7ef617e1/jobs/6810] in CircleCI.}}

It seems like the tests timed out in Circle which happens often with different tests, it is related to the different resources, etc. It is very hard to make everything passing everywhere on all infrastructure as time is always a thing. 

If you reproduce different issue, let's open a ticket. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

[~brandon.williams], any objections around {{test_multiple_repair}}{{? I see that log archives are already wiped from [~k-rus]'s runs but you can check the logs from those I linked today. }}

 

Thanks for explaining things and running fresh tests, [~e.dimitrova], I agree with everything you've said. Timeouts at such a small degree have to be tolerated, and a timeout alone isn't a smoking gun for anything, so tickets with nothing to go on except a timeout don't have enough to proceed since they can often be transient failures in the infrastructure and not the code.

[~e.dimitrova] Thank you for explaining! Now it is clear for me, so I will not bring such false positives in future.
