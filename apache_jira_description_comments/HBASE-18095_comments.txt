There is an additional complication here for token-based authentication.  When a delegation token is used for SASL authentication, the client uses the cluster ID obtained from Zookeeper to select the token identifier to use.  So there would also need to be some Zookeeper-less, unauthenticated way to obtain the cluster ID as well.

As far as I know, in branch-1, replication information, like replication peers are stored in ZK, if user want to list or modify replication relationship using ReplicationAdmin, they need zookeeper client

Yes, but this is admin action. The scope of the JIRA is for normal client access. Just to be clear. :-)

[~ghelmling] Cluster ID lookup is most easily accomplished with a new servlet on the HTTP(S) endpoint on the masters, serving the cluster ID as plain text. It can't share the RPC server endpoint when SASL is enabled because any interaction with that endpoint must be authenticated. This is ugly but alternatives seem worse. One alternative would be a second RPC port for APIs that do not / cannot require prior authentication.

Seems like the best option.  Would this still work if SPNEGO is enabled?  If not, I'm not sure what else we can do short of a totally new endpoint.

Will have to check. If not then agreed we will need a totally new endpoint. 

I do like dropping the ZK dependencies for regular clients, and make ZK more of an HBase-internal communication service.


Should the new configuration setting for the master locations be set in the conf/hbase-site.xml under a new property?

Yes

Work is in progress for this jira.

Unassigning. This issue is free to pick up and carry forward. 

I have a prototype patch that seems to be working for me locally (basic sanity testing). So I'm assigning this jira to myself. I propose to split the work into 3 sub-tasks so that it is easy to review and (hopefully) easy to backport.

1. Server side changes: Implement an in-memory cache in the HMasters (both active and standby) that caches the HRLs of all the meta replicas. We also need to install listeners to track changes to the meta znodes to invalidate the cache when meta state changes. Master (both active and standby) now exposes new RPC calls that let clients fetch this information.

2. Client side changes: Implement a new AsyncRegistry replacing ZkAsyncRegistry that parses the list of static master addresses from client local hbase-site.xml and makes use of RPCs exposed from step (1) to determine which of the listed masters is active and fetch the meta locations (tracked by all the masters). We can pick a random master to fetch the meta locations to avoid hot spotting of the active master.

3. Figure out a way to plumb auth-less ClusterID for clients using delegation tokens.

I have a working patch for (1) and (2) is almost done (need to clean up and add some test coverage). I still need to look into (3) and understand the problem better. Coming to the backports, I think this should be doable on 2.x but could turn out to be tricky on 1.x (probably needs to be redone totally) because the code diverged quite a bit (no AsyncClient stuff in 1.x AFAICT).

[~apurtell]  / others. Thoughts? If the approach seems reasonable I can put up my patches for review to get some initial feedback.

When creating a patch, I figured it'd be easier if I merge (1) and (2). I added a TODO for (3). [Pull request|https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/781] is up and I attached the diff to the jira. [~apurtell] Appreciate if you can give any initial feedback. I'm still working on better test coverage and (3).

Nice work (And was fun re-reading [~apurtell] 's original).

We'd purge zk from client-side. Above it says we'd need it for Admin/Replication still? Could we get rid of it for this too?

So, this inlines Master when it comes to read/write. At least it is for meta lookups only. Related, HBASE-23055 got pushback because it goes to Master for meta location; in particular if meta moves, the Master could get hit by all clients a bunch of times. This would have same issue but no-zk-on-the-hbase-client-side would make it worthwhile. Enabling as default for hbase3 and optional in hbase2 would be sweet.

Nice work.

Linking HBASE-23055 because it wants to ask Master, the authority, where hbase:meta is rather than go direct to zk. HBASE-23055 also caches in Master the hbase:meta location.

bq. Related, HBASE-23055 got pushback because it goes to Master for meta location; in particular if meta moves, the Master could get hit by all clients a bunch of times. 

An unavoidable consequence, but at least the clients can ask any master, active or passive, at random.

As orthogonal work. Make add_peer and remove_peer functionality go through a new admin API instead of twiddling znodes directly. There's probably a JIRA for that somewhere already

Just need to say it out loud so it is plain there is this 'fundamental' change in cluster operation (It was a 'mistake' to expose ZK -- smile).

Yeah. Follow-on. Lets do this too.

I left some comments on the PR. I think this is a great improvement! I have a broader question, which is why limit many operations to just the active master or even just the collection of masters? Why not provide client services from all cluster members?

Thanks Nick, for reviewing the PR. I'm waiting for a couple of dependent changes ([807|https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/807], [812|https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/812]) to be merged before I rebase my original PR. There is a lot of scope for refactoring and you already highlighted some of them. I'll attempt to address your comments during the rebase.

The goal is to expose these client services RPCs in all the masters and not just the active masters. Based on my limited experience here, the reason I think this was not targeted for all the cluster members is for the following reasons.
 - Client configuration overhead. All the clients now need to know the client services endpoints (hostnames and ports) of all the servers before they attempt to make their first connection. This is somewhat manageable if we limit it just to the masters (I think).
 - Adding to the above point, I think there is a greater likelihood of region servers being removed/added from a cluster maintenance/scaling perspective. In such cases, all the client configuration needs to be updated, otherwise clients keep hitting dead servers or might not hit some newly added servers etc.
 - More state management overhead with higher cluster<->ZK traffic because each cluster member now needs to watch for meta region location changes / keep track of ClusterID etc.

Again, this is just my understanding. Probably [~apurtell] has a better answer.

[~bharathv] is making nice progress here. I'd like to have a discussion about the viability of pack-porting this patch and rolling upgrades. If we think we have a palatable rolling upgrade story, I think we should push it at least as far back as branch-1. If the upgrade path isn't clear, I think it stays on master.

We want this in our operations so that would be a vote for a branch-1 backport. Means we won't have to maintain a local patch. The upgrade story is clean. This is an additive change. Masters and zookeeper will both be able to provide service for a client configured to use either, until such time a site is completely migrated. Then as an operator you'd probably want to restrict cluster clients from accessing zookeeper service ports, but this would be up to the site operator. These separate means of discovery can coexist for as long as they need to.

bq. why limit many operations to just the active master or even just the collection of masters

I missed this question, sorry.

A number of similar distributed systems have a notion of a bootstrap set, a list of well known addresses from which a client can discover all other service roles and locations necessary to know for operation. In today's HBase operations the zookeeper quorum peer list serves this role. When proposing this I thought zk quorum list -> hbase master list would be a nice simple lateral change easy to understand and familiar. 

re: backports, sure, that makes sense. This means we'll need more complexity in our client to decide the right connection mechanism, presumably based on available configuration. It would also be nice to sort out a deprecation schedule for the old path.

Let me start a feature branch where we can start to land the patches that are ready.

[~bharathv] (This is great stuff). Was wondering if there is a one-pager on the overall approach? I'm interested in high-level stuff. For example, how we tell client about list of Masters. Will the client try one Master first or will it query all in parallel or will it be a hedged read. We are adding Masters' inline with read/write now which is a new development. What do we think the loading will be like? Will we need to do work to make the Master fit for new purpose. Thanks.

[~stack] I wrote a quick google doc to summarize this so that it is easier to collaborate using inline comments. Appreciate any feedback.

[~bharathv] Writeup is excellent. Thanks. Helps. Left a few notes on it if of use.

For those following this work, I'd like to update the current status. Most critical patches are already in (see the subtasks). There are just two pending PRs [1, 2] that are already approved and should be committed soon. The nightly test runs on the feature branch [3] are relatively stable (except the flaky test of TestFromClientSide which is fixed by [2] and the remaining tests failures are not specific to this branch). Once the remaining patches are committed (that switches the default registry), I can keep an eye on the nightly job for a few days to make sure nothing else is broken. At this point there are no bugs/feature gaps/performance concerns that I'm aware of (please correct me if I'm wrong).

Now that we are pretty close to getting all the needed patches in, I'd like to kickstart the discussion of merging the feature branch into master and see what other folks think. It is a pain to maintain both the branches since we need frequent rebases. Given the current status of the work and the nightly test runs and the test coverage, I'm fairly confident that this work can land in the master branch. There might be some very little initial friction (for developers writing unit tests) since the code changes are invasive and touch many commonly used codepaths (like connection setup, RPC framework etc) and also rewrites a bunch of tests and common test utilities. But I think those issues can be treated on a case-by-case basis. Worst case, we have a kill-switch for the entire feature (one line change), if we really need it.

If everyone agrees to merge the feature branch, the follow up work would be to
 - Document the feature (client and developer facing) and expectations - HBASE-23331
 - Work on the back ports for branch-2 and branch-1 (targeting the upcoming 2.3.0)
 - Doing some perf runs to see how it compares with the baseline (ZK based registry) and see how the nightly runs behave
 - Fixing test coverage gaps if any.

Sounds like a plan :-)

Since those PRs were approved I merged them.

I'd be in favor of master merge after you think it stable out on the branch.

Merge discussion should be on dev list FYI.

Let me see if can do a quick review of the branch... Hopefully will help.

Does the branch need updating (seems old when I compare to master)


[~stack]  Sure. I'll put up a discuss thread on dev once the branch is stable. I'm working on fixing on the last set of test failures exposed in nightly (via HBASE-23752).
 

> Does the branch need updating (seems old when I compare to master)

Yes please. Can you please rebase it when you get a chance?
 
 

Rebased [~bharathv]

[~bharathv] Pushed again. I think you need the recent errorprone fixes HBASE-23753 on your branch too.

Thanks [~stack].

Thanks everyone, the patch is now committed to the master branch and master registry is the default connection registry implementation. Next step is to back port it to branch-2 (for 2.3.0 release) and I'll do it this week.

If something looks off in the tests, especially connection issues, comment here or ping me directly. I'll also keep an eye on the master nightly builds.

IIRC, one of the problem for MasterRegistry is that, if all the configured masters are gone, then we need to change the configuration to let client know the new masters.

Maybe we could add an option called fallbackToZk? If enabled, when there are no masters available, we fallback to use the zookeeper to fetch all the active and backup masters and then update our configuration.

Thoughts?

Thanks.

One objective of this work is to remove dependencies on ZK in the client for the normal client cases. That objective is defeated if there is a fallback. It would have to be optional. Now we have an optional fallback for an optional choice to remove dependencies on ZK that reintroduces a dependency on ZK? I don’t believe it provides much value anyway. It’s the same situation as if all your ZK quorum goes down. Someone or something (like an autoscaler or process supervisor) will have to start new instances in either case. 

> Maybe we could add an option called fallbackToZk? 

Implementation wise, I think it's pretty simple to do that. We can have a "compound" registry implementation that delegates to primary and secondary registries but yes if all the masters are down and ZK servers are available, the cluster is already in a bad shape. I think there is very little a client could with the connection.

That said, after following the discussion here and in HBASE-11288, I think what the current registry implementations lack (out of the box) is some sort of dynamic resolver interface and re-configuration on the fly. Currently I think everyone is exploiting their infrastructure specific solutions (DNS resolution, lvs etc) to trick the rpcs to be load balanced. Was wondering if we can abstract some of that out and make it pluggable in the client code. 

For example, a simple interface like

{code:java}
interface RegistryEndPointResolver {
  Set<String> getRegistryEndPoints();
}
{code}

The default implementation would be based on the hbase-site.xml config and polled every few seconds. But every one can plug their own implementation into it based on say, DNS, existing service discovery solutions etc. Thoughts?


We have dynamic reloading of configuration implemented in some areas. The ability to reload the configured master addresses seems like a good place to make use of that capability.

As for extending the interface, that would be fine, if a little heavy-handed. I prefer it be a separate interface, as you suggest, so that it can be swapped out without having to re-implement the entire registry. For the interface itself, should it return a {{Set}} of {{java.net.URL}} or {{java.net.SocketAddress}} instead?

> We have dynamic reloading of configuration implemented in some areas. The ability to reload the configured master addresses seems like a good place to make use of that capability.

Yes, I saw the whole ConfigurationObserver thing. For server roles, looks like it is triggered by a an updateConfiguration() RPC but in this case we need a periodic refresher that that reloads configuration on the client.

> For the interface itself, should it return a Set of java.net.URL or java.net.SocketAddress instead?

Right, or a HostAndPort...

I can spin up a patch unless there are any objections with this approach.
