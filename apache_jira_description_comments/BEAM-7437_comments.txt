I am getting consistent failures on the Integration Tests for BigQuery with the Dataflow runner, for the classes `BigQueryFileLoadsIT` and `BigQueryStreamingInsertTransformIntegrationTests` which seem to be related to recent b64 changes. The traceback is:

{code:java}

    work_executor.execute()

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/base64.py", line 78, in b64decode
    raise TypeError(msg)
TypeError: Incorrect padding
{code}

The failure is ONLY on the master branch. I tested the 2.13.0RC2 branch as well. It passed.

I need to investigate this further. 

Is this fixed by [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8748] ?

Thank You [~kedin]
Yes, the PR merged resolved this.

Missed adding streaming=True to PipelineOptions

Does this have to be part of 2.14.0? I don't think so. I'm removing the Fix Version, but happy to chat about why this should / should not be on 2.1.4.0
