Since Gradle 6.8, setting the following improves flaky test reporting by Gradle:
{code:groovy}
 reports.junitXml.mergeReruns = true
{code}
When this new option is enabled, if a test fails but is then retried and succeeds, its failures will be recorded as <flakyFailure> instead of <failure>, within one <testcase> (same as Maven when reruns are enabled).

For Jenkins to understand this notation, we need to use the `JUnitFlakyTestDataPublisher`:
{code:java}
junit testResults: '**/build/test-results/**/TEST-*.xml', testDataPublishers: [[$class: 'JUnitFlakyTestDataPublisher']]
{code}
But this plugin doesn't seem to be installed in Apache Jenkins and is generally not actively maintained (last release was 5 years ago). I filed an issue on the core junit plugin for Jenkins:
