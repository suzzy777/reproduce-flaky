Thanx [~iwasakims]  for the fix.

Changes seems fair enough, but the jenkins doesn't seems behaving as expected. Any idea?

 

Yes. The QA build failed on docker image creation  installing python packages. It seems not to be related to the patch.

Step 26/32 : RUN pip2 install     configparser==4.0.2     pylint==1.9.2

The command '/bin/sh -c pip2 install     configparser==4.0.2     pylint==1.9.2' returned a non-zero code: 1
ERROR: Docker failed to build yetus/hadoop:d84386ccf7a.

hmm, need to see what triggered this at jenkins.

Anyway the fix seems pretty straight forward. The original trunk patch didn't had it in YARN-10022, got added during backport.

+1, Thanx [~iwasakims] for the find. This should ideally unblock 3.1.4 release as well?

cc. [~gabor.bota]

Thanks, [~ayushtkn]. I'm running {{mvn test}} in hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager on my local. I will commit the patch after checking the result.

Since I can reproduce the docker failure by running ./start-build-env.sh, I filed HADOOP-17120.

I got no relevant failure.

The TestApplicationMasterService.testUpdateTrackingUrl looks flaky one. I can not reproduce the failure by rerunning the test.

committed to branch-3.1.

[~iwasakims], thanks for reporting this.. Same will applicable to trunnk and other versions..?

and can give more details on this..?

Since this was brought by the backported patch of YARN-10022, only branch-3.1 and branch-3.2 are affected. I'm going to cherry-pick this to branch-3.2.

The backported patch added duplicated call of  [ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock#lock|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock.html#lock--]. The {{lock()}} increases hold count by one. If it is called twice, the lock will be held until {{unlock()}} is called twice.


cherry-picked to branch-3.2.
