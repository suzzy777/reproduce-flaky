The Utilities class has two methods, {{getInputSummary}} and {{getInputPaths}}, that use the variable {{mapred.dfsclient.parallelism.max}} to get the summary of a list of input locations in parallel. These methods are Hive related, but the variable name does not look it is specific for Hive.

Also, the above variable is not on HiveConf nor used anywhere else. I just found a reference on the Hadoop MR1 code.

I'd like to propose the deprecation of {{mapred.dfsclient.parallelism.max}}, and use a different variable name, such as {{hive.get.input.listing.num.threads}}, that reflects the intention of the variable. The removal of the old variable might happen on Hive 3.x
