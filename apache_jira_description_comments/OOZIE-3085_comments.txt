Thank you [~asasvari] for the review. I made the necessary changes, and updated the Review Board as well. Can you take a look when you will have some time?

[~kmarton] thanks for the new patch, I left some more comments on ReviewBoard. Can you try it out on a real cluster? 

[~gezapeti], [~andras.piros]: this JIRA's summary and description feels quite general / not focused. The patch uploaded here is mainly focusing on logging action _starting_ and _ending_ (not killing). I would either rename it to express we are only dealing with logging in start() and end() methods or create subtasks. For example, in the SubworkflowActionExecutor there are more things that could be interesting to log (e.g. killing a subworkflow action). What do you think? At the same time, can you also have a look at the patch? You might see something I missed.

[~asasvari] I agree w/ extracting to subtasks the scenarios you mentioned.

Your review comments seem extensive enough to me, based on the current patch I cannot add anything.

Conclusions after a short discussion with [~asasvari]:
- the actionID is always filled and it follows the following pattern: jobId@ActionName, but is duplicated, so I will delete it from the log message. The log entry produced by XLog looks like: 
{noformat}2017-12-28 20:01:22,282  INFO ForkActionExecutor:520 - SERVER[kmarton-mbp] USER[martonjuliakinga] GROUP[-] TOKEN[] APP[Fork_workflow] JOB[0000004-171228181538280-oozie-mart-W] ACTION[0000004-171228181538280-oozie-mart-W@fs-paralel] Starting action [0000004-171228181538280-oozie-mart-W@fs-paralel]{noformat}
- in some cases the external status is the same with the status. However there are some cases where it differs, but the status is defined based on the external status,  so I think that the external status has more information content. There is no need for adding the status as well.
- it will be useful to add a log entry when killing an action (where is supported of course)
- I will think on modifying the actual description to be a little bit more precise

If I missed something, or some of you have some additional ideas, feel free to point it out.
