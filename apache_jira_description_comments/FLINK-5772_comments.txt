    [FLINK-5772] [elasticsearch] Allow Elasticsearch 1.x tests to rerun on failure

    It was reported that Elasticsearch 1.x tests can fail with this exception thrown from the embedded ES node used in IT tests:
    `ProcessClusterEventTimeoutException[failed to process cluster event (acquire index lock) within 1m]`.
    
    After some googling on this, it seems like this is a potential deadlock with Elasticsearch 1.x when creating indices.
    
    From the looks of recent Travis tests, it seems that this flakiness rarely happens, so I think retrying the tests if they fail only for Elasticsearch 1.x and not newer versions would be a simple solution.
    
    If it happens to pop out for 2.x and 5.x also, we might need to find another solution.

    [FLINK-5772] [elasticsearch] Allow Elasticsearch 1.x tests to rerun on failure
    
    This is allowed because Elasticsearch 1.x has a potential deadlock when
    creating indices. Since this flakiness rarely happens, this commit
    allows rerunning the Elasticsearch 1.x tests to try to mitigate this
    problem instead of just failing them.
