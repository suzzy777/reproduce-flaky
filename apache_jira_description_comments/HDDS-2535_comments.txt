Hi [~elek]
{quote}Independent from the flakiness I think a test where the timeout is 8 minutes and starts 1000 threads to insert 500 buckets (500_000 buckets all together) it's more like an integration test and would be better to move the slowest part to the integration-test project.

I think now it should run quickly with the fix, and also I think it will not take that much of time. On my local laptop, I see, it is always completed in 30sec.

 

And on github run I see it is completed in 53 seconds. I just want to keep this test in UT, as this will detect any failure in the DoubleBuffer issue which is a critical component in OM. (Why I want in UT, because we are going to force sooner, UT should be always green)

[~elek] Thanks for reporting the flaky test, [~bharat] Thanks for the contribution.

Seeing this again occasionally after [enabling the test|https://github.com/apache/hadoop-ozone/pull/600], eg.:
