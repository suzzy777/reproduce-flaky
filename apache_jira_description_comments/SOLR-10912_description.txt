Proposing introduction of automated patch validation, similar what Hadoop or other Apache projects are using (see link). This would ensure that every patch passes a certain set of criterions before getting approved. It would save time for developer (faster feedback loop), save time for committers (less step to do manually), and would increase quality.

Hadoop is currently using Apache Yetus to run validations, which seems to be a good direction to start. This jira could be the board of discussing the preferred solution.
