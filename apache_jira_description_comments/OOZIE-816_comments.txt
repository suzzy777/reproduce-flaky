Totally new to Oozie code (have used it before though), so not sure if this is right, but mimicked what was already in place.  Probably needs more work.

Hi Grant,
Welcome back.
would you please create review request using reviews.apache.org. We mostly use that for patch review.

Regards,
Mohammad

@Grant, (sorry for the delay on this one), the only thing we should do to support Hadoop 1.0.2 should be creating under hadooplibs the corresponding hadoop-1_0_1 and hadoop-test-1_0_2 directories. The easiest way it to copy the POMs from 1.0.1 and refer to the new version. And of course wire the new modules to the hadooplibs POM. 

Please let us know if you'll take care of it. thx


canceling patch as it is not correct.

Grant, please let us know if you'll be taking care of a new patch. The new patch should just rev up the hadoop version in the hadoop-1 and hadoop-test-1 POMs and set the new default in the main POM. thx

Since 1.0.3 is out, lets target that.

I suspect a 1.0.4 may arise due to a critical HDFS issue, but I do not know any formal announcements for it yet.

Sending patch after testing shortly.

Patch for initial review. Switches all targets up to 1.0.3.

Still running tests, so not marking as available.

Apache Hadoop got a green for the 1.1.1 release yesterday, so we can wait and bump up the trunk to that.

Of note is that HBase's next version (0.96, no ETA yet though) would mark a strong move to the 2.x line of releases and begin to discontinue proper 1.x support.

Hi,Harsh, as far as know, 1.1.1 is a beta release , and comparing with 1.1.1,  1.0.4 is a more stable version. 
And, I have also tested 1.0.4, all oozie UI passed. I have upload my patch in jira 1088.
So,I suggest we can upgrade to 1.0.4 in main pom.xml
MeanWhile, we can continue to support 1.0.1 ,1.0.3 adn 1.1.1 by using Alejandro's method.

Hi,Harsh,Since you are the assignee for this jira, could you update your patch according to Alejandro's methodï¼Ÿ

Hi,

Sorry about the assigned part, I unassigned myself now. Please do go forward with your patch which you have already tested :)

If 1.0.4 is more preferable, then that is fine with me as well. I am not quite sure why 1.1.1 is marked unstable, cause its a bugfix revision over 1.1.0 anyway.

Attaching Zhu's patch from dupe OOZIE-1088  issue here.

Assigning to Zhu Jin Wei.

I have only run TestJavaActionExecutor, and it passed. I think we need to run it again with OOZIE-1088-trunk.patch
 

Hi,Harsh, could you help to re-run the test-patch ?   

Here's a new patch that changes Zhu's bump to 1.0.4 to 1.1.1 which Apache Hadoop's just announced as a stable release upstream (since we're upgrading trunk, we could as well go to 1.1.1).

Also re-triggering tests.

Unclear what caused these two failures (log does not seem to indicate an issue clearly).

Running them locally does pass, so tests may be flaky:

Will go ahead and commit and we can investigate these failures if they appear over all builds again.

Thanks [~zhujinwei], I've committed this to trunk.

Thanks, Harsh.  I think the fail tests may be flaky,too.

Hi, Harsh, I have upgraded branch oozie3.2.0's hadoop version into 1.1.1,  I want to upload my patch this jira too. 

And I have run "mvn test", all the UT passed.  I also want to run "testpatch" , but in oozie3.2.0 source code , there is no testpatch script in "bin" directory. Do you know if I can use trunk's testpatch script to test my patch?  

Another thing, do you know how to format patch or do you have fromat template ?


Hi,Harsh,I reopen this jira, because I want to upgrade branch oozie3.2.0's hadoop version into 1.1.1.

Hi,

AFAIK, we are no longer keen on maintaining the 3.2-branch now that 3.3 is out (there have been no commits on the 3.2 branch in over 3 months). Would targeting a future 3.3.x release be OK instead?

Hi Zhu,

Haven't heard back on your 3.3 backport request (above comment)?

Resolving as "Fixed" because this already is in branch-3.3 and trunk.  It won't go into branch-3.2 because we're not making any more releases from that branch.  

Closing issue; Oozie 3.3.2 is released
