Dan, you seem to be the last person who touched this test. It appears the flakiness of the test had to do with the general non-determinism of
impala memory usage. I believe that's the same case for IMPALA-2728.

I looped this 2000 times and wasn't able to reproduce it.  Also tried setting num_scanner_threads=1, and still wasn't able to repro.  

Please reopen if it shows up again on the builds, but otherwise I don't think we should adjust the mem_limit unless we can verify.
