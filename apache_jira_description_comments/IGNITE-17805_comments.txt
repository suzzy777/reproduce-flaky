Looks like the problem is caused by the fact that on TC remote JVM version (19) is different from the version of the host JVM (8).

Ignite needs certain --add-opens JVM args to run on Java 9+, but we cannot add them on Java 8 as it fails to start due to args unknown to it. So the args are version-specific.

When we launch a remote JVM, we copy --add-opens (if needed) from the host JVM. If its major version matches host major version, everything works OK, but if the versions differ, the remote JVM might lack the --add-opens args required for this version. This is what happened here.

Probably the best thing we can do now is just disallow such 'version mix' configuration.

If, in the future, we need such mixed configurations, specific tests should be created to test exactly 'we can work in a mixed cluster' property.

The failing test is flaky https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&testNameId=8200205530339925035&tab=testDetails , it passed in the branch corresponding to this PR [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=6812654&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Cache6] , so the failure can be ignored.

[~ktkalenko@gridgain.com] could you please take a look at the attached PR?

[~rpuch] Looks good.
