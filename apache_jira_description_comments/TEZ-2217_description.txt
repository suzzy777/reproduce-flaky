The min-held containers constraint is respected during query idle times, but is not respected when a query is actually in motion.

The AM releases unused containers during dag execution without checking for min-held containers.

{code}
2015-03-20 15:41:53,475 INFO [DelayedContainerManager] rm.YarnTaskSchedulerService: Container's idle timeout expired. Releasing container, containerId=container_1424502260528_1348_01_000013, containerExpiryTime=1426891313264, idleTimeoutMin=5000

{code}

This is actually useful only after the AM has received a soft pre-emption message, doing it on an idle cluster slows down one of the most common query patterns in BI systems.

{code}
create temporary table smalltable as ...; 
select ... bigtable JOIN smalltable ON ...;
{code}

The smaller query in the beginning throws away the pre-warmed capacity.
