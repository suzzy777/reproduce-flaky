created 1.4.13 in jira. cleaned out things listed in TODO for 1.4.12.

current flaky report for the branch attached. Only problem test looks to be {{TestSnapshotFromMaster#testAsyncSnapshotWillNotBlockSnapshotHFileCleaner}}, and in branch-1.4 that test assumes taking a snapshot will take less than 11 seconds. looks like we're just taking longer sometimes.

git/jira inclusion in 1.4.12 is lined up.
