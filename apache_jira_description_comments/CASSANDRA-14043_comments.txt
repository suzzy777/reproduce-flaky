I'm trying to reproduce these failures/flakes so I can debug them, but these appear to pass locally for me against latest trunk running on Mac OSX (once I setup the 9 localhost aliases needed by Mac). Do these fail every time for you or is it more of a flakey experience?

e.g.

{noformat}
~/pg/cassandra-dtest-mirror(CASSANDRA-14043*) Â» nosetests --no-skip -x consistency_test.py                                       
...........
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 24 tests in 1388.105s

OK
{noformat}



These kind of errors usually seem to be environment related. If they are flaky (esp. failures like {{"Error starting node1."}}), it might not be that test specifically, but something in it may trigger the behavior.

Perhaps you run a single test function in a loop and wait until it fails. Here's a [naive script|https://gist.github.com/jasobrown/b293aaa989bf86c3a0d1e0bef1541e5b] I use. It's not brilliant, but useful
