Made a mistake in the fix for STORM-3310. The consumer in one of the tests check for interrupt in a place it shouldn't.

The consumer accept method shouldn't check for interrupt, as that is handled by the ConsumerThd.run method. When the accept check for interrupt is hit, the consumer exits without draining the JCQueue, and the test may fail.
