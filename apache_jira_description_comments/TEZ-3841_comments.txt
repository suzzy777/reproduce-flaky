Welcome [~SolalPirelli] to Tez community! Did you send an email to dev mailing list? There you can get more reply. Not every one follows the jira update. 

The idea looks interesting. But I suggest more elaboration on the requirement, for example, the scope of performance issue (CPU wise, or event wise, or network wise), because this really affect how you will implement it. Right now you can simulate many things even without fake task launcher or task communicator. Faking Input/Process/Output are already used in test. Scheduling and event routing can be specified via custom vertex/edge manager. 

Implementation wise, you might want to consider implement it as plugin. Current task launcher, task communicator and task scheduler are all pluggable. How to make it as close as to reality is another challenge depends on the scope of issue you want to solve. I notice you use thread to run each task. This may not work well if you want to try very large scale (like tens of thousands of containers).

I'll add the Apache licenses later - weird though that the bot only points out 2 of the >2 files I added (none of which have the header).

Since I attached the same patch twice (I forgot `--no-prefix` in the first one), but it resulted in two unrelated test failures, I guess those tests are flaky?

Work abandoned, shifting priorities. Sorry.
