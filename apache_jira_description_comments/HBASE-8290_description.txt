I reproduce it all the time if I comment the sleep here:

{code}
  private void verifyAllBufferedPutsHaveFlushed(HTableMultiplexerStatus status) {
    int retries = 8;
    int tries = 0;
    do {         /*
      try {
        Thread.sleep(2 * TEST_UTIL.getConfiguration().getLong(
          HTableMultiplexer.TABLE_MULTIPLEXER_FLUSH_FREQ_MS, 100));
        tries++;
      } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
      }         */
    } while (status.getTotalBufferedCounter() != 0 && tries != retries);

    assertEquals("There are still some buffered puts left in the queue",
        0, status.getTotalBufferedCounter());
  }
{code}

Given that getTotalBufferedCounter is never decremented, there is a misunderstanding somewhere. As well, reading plain values without a volatile or a synchronized in a MT context is likely to be wrong.
