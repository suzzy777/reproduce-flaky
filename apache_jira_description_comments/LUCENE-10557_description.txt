A few (not the majority) Apache projects already use the GitHub issue instead of Jira. For example,

Airflow: [https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues]

BookKeeper: [https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues]

So I think it'd be technically possible that we move to GitHub issue. I have little knowledge of how to proceed with it, I'd like to discuss whether we should migrate to it, and if so, how to smoothly handle the migration.

The major tasks would be:
 * (/) Get a consensus about the migration among committers
 * (/) Choose issues that should be moved to GitHub - We'll migrate all issues towards an atomic switch to GitHub if no major technical obstacles show up.
 ** Discussion thread [https://lists.apache.org/thread/1p3p90k5c0d4othd2ct7nj14bkrxkr12]
 ** -Conclusion for now: We don't migrate any issues. Only new issues should be opened on GitHub.-
 ** Write a prototype migration script - the decision could be made on that. Things to consider:
 *** version numbers - labels or milestones?
 *** add a comment/ prepend a link to the source Jira issue on github side,
 *** add a comment/ prepend a link on the jira side to the new issue on github side (for people who access jira from blogs, mailing list archives and other sources that will have stale links),
 *** convert cross-issue automatic links in comments/ descriptions (as suggested by Robert),
 *** strategy to deal with sub-issues (hierarchies),
 *** maybe prefix (or postfix) the issue title on github side with the original LUCENE-XYZ key so that it is easier to search for a particular issue there?
 *** how to deal with user IDs (author, reporter, commenters)? Do they have to be github users? Will information about people not registered on github be lost?
 *** create an extra mapping file of old-issue-new-issue URLs for any potential future uses.
 *** what to do with issue numbers in git/svn commits? These could be rewritten but it'd change the entire git history tree - I don't think this is practical, while doable.
* Prepare a complete migration tool
** See https://github.com/apache/lucene-jira-archive/issues/5 
* Build the convention for issue label/milestone management
 ** See [https://github.com/apache/lucene-jira-archive/issues/6]
 ** Do some experiments on a sandbox repository [https://github.com/mocobeta/sandbox-lucene-10557]
 ** Make documentation for metadata (label/milestone) managementÂ 
 * (/) Enable Github issue on the lucene's repository
 ** Raise an issue on INFRA
 ** (Create an issue-only private repository for sensitive issues if it's needed and allowed)
 ** Set a mail hook to [issues@lucene.apache.org|mailto:issues@lucene.apache.org] (many thanks to the general mail group name)
 * Set a schedule for migration
 ** See [https://github.com/apache/lucene-jira-archive/issues/7]
 ** Give some time to committers to play around with issues/labels/milestones before the actual migration
 ** Make an announcement on the mail lists
 ** Show some text messages when opening a new Jira issue (in issue template?)
