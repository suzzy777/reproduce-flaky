In some jdbc tests, if the query runs over 30s, the query may be failed by socket read timeout, or ```out of sequence response``` in some cases.
The reason is that the embedded metastore will set the login timeout of DriverManager during CLIService initialization, the login timeout is set to default value of [HikariConfig|https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/blob/dev/src/main/java/com/zaxxer/hikari/HikariConfig.java#L54] , so the tests after will  use the defined login timeout to creating thrift connection until [HIVE-12731|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12371].

for some tests, some are spending time for ProgressMonitor:
