The affected version should be 2.13 because it's in an asf 2.x job

Just saw this on an asf-master-exhaustive run:
{noformat}
query_test/test_kudu.py:383: in test_column_storage_attributes
    assert cursor.fetchall() == \
E   assert [] == [(27, True, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...)]
E     Right contains more items, first extra item: (27, True, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...)
E     Use -v to get the full diff{noformat}

In addition to test_column_storage_attributes, we've seen behavior like this in IMPALA-7036, IMPALA-6922 and IMPALA-7028

I think this might be another occurrence:

    IMPALA-6812: Fix flaky Kudu scan tests
    
    Many of our Kudu related tests have been flaky with the symptom that
    scans appear to not return rows that were just inserted. This occurs
    because our default Kudu scan level of READ_LATEST doesn't make any
    consistency guarantees.
    
    This patch adds a query option 'kudu_read_mode', which overrides the
    startup flag of the same name, and then set that option to
    READ_AT_SNAPSHOT for all tests with Kudu inserts and scans, which
    should give us more consistent test results.
    
    Testing:
    - Passed a full exhaustive run. Does not appear to increase time to
      run by any significant amount.

Commit abf6f8f465e6b99fdd0a97e12bbde143ef98f3db in impala's branch refs/heads/master from [~philip]

Fix TestKuduOperations tests in test-with-docker by using consistent hostname.

TestKuduOperations, when run using test-with-docker, failed with errors
like:

  Remote error: Service unavailable: Timed out: could not wait for desired
  snapshot timestamp to be consistent: Tablet is lagging too much to be able to
  serve snapshot scan. Lagging by: 1985348 ms, (max is 30000 ms):

The underlying issue, as discovered by Thomas Tauber-Marshall, is that Kudu
serializes the hostnames of Kudu tablet servers, and, different containers in
test-with-docker use different hostnames.  This was exposed after "IMPALA-6812:
Fix flaky Kudu scan tests" switched to using READ_AT_SNAPSHOT for Kudu reads.

Using the same hostname for all the containers is easy and harmless;
this change does just that.

IMPALA-7790: Skip some Kudu tests if use_hybrid_clock=false

Since IMPALA-6812, we've run many of our tests against Kudu at the
READ_AT_SNAPSHOT scan level, which ensures consistent results. This
scan level is only supported if Kudu is run with the flag
--use_hybrid_clock=true (which is the default).

This patch uses the Kudu master webui to detect when use_hybrid_clock
is false and skips these tests.

Follow up work will address allowing these tests to run regardless of
the value of the flag.

Testing:
- Ran a full exhaustive build with use_hybrid_clock=false set in the
  minicluster.
