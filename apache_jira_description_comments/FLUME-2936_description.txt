KafkaSource tests are flaky, and tend to fail. I investigated this issue and discovered the following issues:

* KafkaSource hangs in doStart at line 413:
{code:title=KafkaSourceEmbeddedKafka.java|borderStyle=solid}
 it = consumer.poll(1000).iterator();
{code}

I fixed that by simply changing HOST in KafkaSourceEmbeddedKafka to localhost.

* Out of memory exception. I fixed that by properly configuring MAVEN_OPTS, as stated in the documentation.
