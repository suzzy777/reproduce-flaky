[~gaborkaszab] I'm assigning this to you since you worked on IMPALA-11387 recently.

Hey [~rizaon] ,

Does this test fail constantly? IMPALA-11387 seems pretty unrelated for me. Isn't it possible that this test is simply flaky

It does look like flaky. It failed on ASAN build last night.
[~hemanth619] [~boroknagyz] any idea why this test becomes flaky?

Failed in https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-20.04-from-scratch-ARM/56/testReport/junit/custom_cluster.test_events_custom_configs/TestEventProcessingCustomConfigs/test_iceberg_self_events/ too.

I think events are crammed to process in less than a second. Probably bumping up [this number|https://github.infra.cloudera.com/saihemanth/Impala/blob/cdw-master_test_sync_ddl/tests/custom_cluster/test_events_custom_configs.py#L611] to 5 might be helpful to avoid flakiness.
