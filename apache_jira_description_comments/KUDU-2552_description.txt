The {{HmsConfigurations/MasterStressTest.Test/0}} test scenario became flaky in ASAN build configurations:

{noformat}
F0821 03:27:52.885350 22135 master-stress-test.cc:310] Check failed: _s.ok() Bad status: Timed out: ReplaceTablet timed out after deadline expired: ReplaceTablet RPC to 127.20.245.189:54605 timed out after 1.346s (SENT)
{noformat}

It looks like the flake is easily reproduced using {{dist-test}}.
