For CellChunkMap we may need a cell such that the chunk out of which it was created, the id of the chunk be embedded in it so that when doing flattening we can use the chunk id as a meta data. More details will follow once the initial tasks are completed. 

Why we need to embed the chunkid in the Cell is described by [~anastas] in this remark over in parent issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14921?focusedCommentId=15244119&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15244119
