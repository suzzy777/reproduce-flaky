1) New test file with some reconfig failure cases. 
2) Moved testLeaderTimesoutOnNewQuorum from ReconfigTest to the new file
3) Added a check to standaloneDisabledTest.java

There is a typo "loose" -> "lose" in testLeaderTimesoutOnNewQuorum().

Would you care to remove trailing spaces by:
{code}
sed -i '' 's/[[:blank:]]*$//' $filename
{code}


Everything else looks good.

It seems previous build failed some flaky tests that I tried successfully in local.
Test it again.

I also format some unaligned code.

SUCCESS: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2417 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2417/])
ZOOKEEPER-2017 New tests for reconfig failure cases (Alexander Shraer and Hongchao Deng via michim) (michim: http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Apache-SVN&view=rev&rev=1620111)
* /zookeeper/trunk/CHANGES.txt
* /zookeeper/trunk/src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/ReconfigFailureCases.java
* /zookeeper/trunk/src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/ReconfigRecoveryTest.java
* /zookeeper/trunk/src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/StandaloneDisabledTest.java
* /zookeeper/trunk/src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/test/ReconfigTest.java


The test suite {{ReconfigFailureCases}} that was introduced in this patch has not been running during pre-commit, because the build's test inclusion pattern looks for classes ending in "Test".  I filed a patch on ZOOKEEPER-2182 to rename it to {{ReconfigFailureCasesTest}}.
