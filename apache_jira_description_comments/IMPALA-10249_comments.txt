Hi [~tarmstrong@cloudera.com], this looks like an old test. Do you know who is suitable to be the assignee?

I missed this. Maybe [~asherman] can take a look since he's been doing some work in the shell.

Commit 47dbfde0b2cabd14452f18527e954aec5891224c in impala's branch refs/heads/master from Andrew Sherman

IMPALA-10249: Fix the flaky TestImpalaShell.test_queries_closed test.

This test for IMPALA-897 is testing that queries run by Impala Shell
from a script file are closed correctly.  This is tested by an assertion
that there is one in-flight query during execution of a script
containing several queries. The test then closes the shell and checks
that there are no in-flight queries. This is the assertion which failed.
Change this assertion to instead wait for the number of in-flight
queries to be zero. This avoids whatever race was causing the flakiness.
