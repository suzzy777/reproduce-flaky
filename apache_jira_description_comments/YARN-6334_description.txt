Due to a bug in {{while}} loop. 
{code}
    int maxWaitingAttempts = 2000;
    while (maxWaitingAttempts-- > 0 ) {
      if (rm.getRMContext().getHAServiceState() == HAServiceState.STANDBY) {
        break;
      }
      Thread.sleep(1);
    }
    Assert.assertFalse("RM didn't transition to Standby ",
        maxWaitingAttempts == 0);
{code}
maxWaitingAttempts is -1 if RM didn't transition to Standby.
