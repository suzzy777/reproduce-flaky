Current CDC implementation blocks writes if the CDC segments have filled up. This makes sense for some use-cases. In other cases it would be beneficial for C* to prune the CDC segments if they haven't been consumed. This will prevent blocking of writes. With this change we will introduce a flag to prune CDC segments much like a circular buffer. This will prevent the writes being blocked.
