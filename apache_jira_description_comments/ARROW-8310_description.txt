Minio emits an {{XMinioServerNotInitialized}} exception on failure to connect, which is recognized by {{ConnectRetryStrategy}} and used to trigger a retry instead of an error. This exception has an HTTP error 503.

However this code does not round trip through the AWS SDK, which maintains an explicit [mapping from known exception names to error codes|https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/blob/d36c2b16c9c3caf81524ebfff1e70782b8e1a006/aws-cpp-sdk-core/source/client/CoreErrors.cpp#L37] and will demote an unrecognized exception name [to {{CoreErrors::UNKNOWN}}|https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/blob/master/aws-cpp-sdk-core/source/client/AWSErrorMarshaller.cpp#L150]

The end result is flakiness in the test (and therefore CI) since {{ConnectRetryStrategy}} never gets a chance to operate, see for example https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6789/checks?check_run_id=552871444#step:6:1778

Probably {{IsConnectError}} will need to examine the error string in the event of {{CoreErrors::UNKNOWN}}.
