I am the [Flink Jira Bot|https://github.com/apache/flink-jira-bot/] and I help the community manage its development. I see this issues has been marked as Major but is unassigned and neither itself nor its Sub-Tasks have been updated for 30 days. I have gone ahead and added a "stale-major" to the issue". If this ticket is a Major, please either assign yourself or give an update. Afterwards, please remove the label or in 7 days the issue will be deprioritized.

[~echauchot] could you PTAL when you have time?

[~arvid] sure, I'll take a look when I have time. Can you assign to me ?

Thank you, I assigned you.

I took a look: it seems to be due to a load problem. When Cassandra writes data it waits for a given number of replicas to ack the write before responding to the client. In that case it writes to a node and to a replica. And it is the replica that did not respond in time hence the timeout at Cassandra client level. As the Cassandra cluster is an embedded daemon it is not very surprising that it is sensitive to load. I'd approach like this: 
 # first try to reduce the expectations in cassandra consistency by setting consistency to _ConsistencyLevel.ANY_ rather than _ConsistencyLevel.ONE_ which is ok for a test. Later see in time if the ITest is still flaky
 # If the test is still flaky, then migrate the cassandra test cluster from embedded daemon to either testContainers (relies on docker so less sensitive to load) or ASF v2 licenced test component such as Achilles (that I used in Apache Beam and that I contributed to) which has a lot of knobs for configuring the cluster.

potential fix merged to master: c40bbf1e87cc62880905cd567dca05a4e15aff35

thanks [~chesnay] for review/merge. So far (2 days), there was no failure on AZP in test connectors CI

Not sure if it's still the same issue; there are too many cassandra test-instability tickets to make sense of things.

Hi Chesnay, thanks for the pointer. Indeed it is not the same ticket but I can definitely take a look. I'll open the related ticket.

Hi [~echauchot] , there is currently a pending issue for the above "no host available..." problem: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-23047, it would be great if you could also have a look~

[~chesnay]  [~gaoyunhaii] yes I just found it as well. I'l comment in the related ticket

[~trohrmann] thanks for pointing out but the failure indicates:
{code:java}
Caused by: com.datastax.driver.core.exceptions.WriteTimeoutException: Cassandra timeout during write query at consistency ONE (1 replica were required but only 0 acknowledged the write) {code}
This should be fixed in [this merged PR|https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/17849]  Now every write request writes at consistency = ANY so there is no replica. 

My guess is that this failure did not happen on master but rather on an older branch or am I mistaken ?

It happened on 1.14; we only merged the potential fix to master.

[~chesnay] that is what I thought. Thanks for the confirmation.

It's been 13 days since we merged the fix to master and AFAIK there was no occurrence of this replica timeout failure on master since then. I think we can close this ticket.

Still I'm working on [migrating Cassandra to test containers|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-25147 ] to try to fix the other flakiness issues we have on Cassandra connector.

Can we backport the fix to {{1.14}} and {{1.13}} [~echauchot]?

[~trohrmann] of course !

[~trohrmann] [~chesnay] here are the backport PRs:
