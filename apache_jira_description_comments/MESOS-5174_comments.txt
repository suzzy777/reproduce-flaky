commit 26a8168f1fc456474204895fea22921eee4b9adb

    Added metrics to the balloon framework.
    
    Adds metrics to gauge the health of the framework.  This includes:
    
    * uptime_secs = How long the framework has been running.
    * registered = If the framework is registered.
    * tasks_finished = Number of tasks finished (successfully).
    * tasks_oomed = Number of tasks that were OOM killed.
    * allowed_terminations = Number of terminal status updates which
      are acceptable due to infrastructure reasons.
    * abnormal_terminations = Number of terminal status updates which
      were not `TASK_FINISHED` or `TASK_FAILED` due to OOM.

    Split the balloon scheduler into a Process to support metrics.
    
    Adds a `BalloonSchedulerProcess` which holds a subset of the `Scheduler`
    class's methods.  The `BalloonScheduler` dispatches to the process
    when for non-logging business logic.  This also opens up the balloon
    framework for libprocess metrics.

    Removed private header from the balloon framework.
    
    Changes the `statusUpdate` handler to explicitly enumerate terminal
    states. Previously, the handler used an internal utility method, which
    would not be available if this framework were compiled outside of Mesos.

commit 61239701dbb772d34807ca2d62dafce6cf9bc235

    Updated balloon framework code with flags and better resource math.
    
    This gives the example `balloon-framework` enough options to run
    outside of the build environment:
    
    * Adds an option for restricting the number of resources per task
      (otherwise, it will eat up an entire node).
    * Adds an option for persisting the framework and launching one task
      after another.
    * Adds filters for declined offers.

    Updated balloon framework spacing and logging.
    
    Changes some whitespace for the balloon framework and
    changes most logging messages to use glog.

    Updated balloon executor.
    
    Fixes the logic in the example `balloon-executor` to work in cases not
    exercised by the `ROOT_CGROUPS_BalloonFramework` test.
    
    * The "task" logic was moved into a separate thread.  This fixes the
      case where the balloon executor does not exceed the memory limit.
      (i.e. by Unblocking the driver's thread while sending status updates.)
    * Changed log messages to use glog.
    * Added logic to prevent multiple task launches with the same executor.
