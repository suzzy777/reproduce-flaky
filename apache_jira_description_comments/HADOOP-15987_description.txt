The jira covers the following:
* We should assert that the table name is configured when DynamoDBMetadataStore is used for testing, so the test should fail if it's not configured.
* We should assert that the test table is not the same as the production table, as the test table could be modified and destroyed multiple times during the test.
* This behavior should be added to the testing docs.

[Assume from junit doc|http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/Assume.html]:
{noformat}
A set of methods useful for stating assumptions about the conditions in which a test is meaningful. 
A failed assumption does not mean the code is broken, but that the test provides no useful information. 
The default JUnit runner treats tests with failing assumptions as ignored.
{noformat}

A failed assert will cause test failure instead of just skipping the test.
