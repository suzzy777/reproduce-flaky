(Disclaimer: I work with Indumathy, and we've talked a good bit about this problem offline.)

I took a crack at implementing this via a Shard "Install' ("Import"?  Not sure about the naming here...) collection-admin API.  Ended up being pretty straightforward.  The API is able to use the same restore fundamentals Solr already has, but exposed by an end-user interface that's much more natural for offline-indexing use cases.

Check out the draft PR [here|https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1458].  Definitely not ready to commit - needs some input validation, tests, docs, etc.  But should be enough to showcase the general approach for anyone interested.

Nitpick: Please don't refer to Solr in all-caps.

SOLR-16697: Add API to install indices into specific shards (#1458)

API is available at POST /collections/collName/shards/shardName/install

All of the "meat" of this API already existed in some of the utilities used
by the RESTORE API.  This commit largely just adds API bindings to
expose and interface suitable for the single-shard installation use-case.

Callers are expected to put the involved collection into "read only" mode
prior to installing data to shards, and must ensure that the data being
installed is compatible with the collection's schema and config.

I've merged this to main and plan on backporting soon.  But I noticed that over the weekend there were a few test failures for S3InstallShardTest, a new test added in this commit.

AFAICT those failures are from a OOM in the test JVM.

It might just be a fluke, but it's also possible that S3InstallShardTest is a bad citizen memory-wise.  Anyway, I plan to give this a few more days to see if the failure recurs before backporting.

SOLR-16697: Cleanup up InstallShard test collections

SOLR-16697: Up AbstractInstallShardTest timeout

The S3 subclass of this test has been sporadically exceeding its
timeout, likely due to underlying performance problems with S3Mock
itself (see PR #1545).  This commit increases the timeout for the
particular failing action slightly, and restructures a few assertions
to produce more helpful error messages.

(This commit also bundles a few test fixes that were made separately on
'main')


Alright!  Following a bit of fiddling with some flaky test issues, it looks like they're happy with this change.  I backported to 9.x this morning (so it'll be in the 9.3 release), and I'm going to close this out for now.

If anyone gets a chance to try this out, I'd love feedback on the functionality and interface.  We've got some flexibility to change things if anyone has feedback prior to this going out the door in 9.3!

SOLR-16697: Align install-shard docs

The "Install Shard" API docs used the wrong v1 "command" or "action"
name.  This commit corrects them, so that 'INSTALLSHARDDATA' is now used
instead of "INSTALLSHARD".
