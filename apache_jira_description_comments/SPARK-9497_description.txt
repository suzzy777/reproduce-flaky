Seems it is pretty often to see DistributedSuite failed right after "repeatedly failing task that crashes JVM".

One example jenkins can be found at 
https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/Spark-Master-SBT/3117/AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE=hadoop1.0,label=centos/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark/DistributedSuite/

The log of it can be found at https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/Spark-Master-SBT/3117/AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE=hadoop1.0,label=centos/artifact/core/target/unit-tests.log (search StopAppClient).
