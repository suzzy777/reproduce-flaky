An on-disk index for string (literal) datatypes. This index is used for the following datatypes:
 * UTF8Type
 * AsciiType
 * CompositeType
 * Frozen types

This includes the ability to write the index to disk at index creation, by specific index rebuild and during SSTable compaction.Â 

Also the ability to query the on-disk index and combine the results with those from the in-memory indexes created by CASSANDRA-18058.
