I suppose this test is flaky due to XPath expression used to identify "Save" button on the interpreter page: 
{code}
//div[contains(@class,'box')][contains(.,'%spark')]//form//button[1]
{code}

As one can see on attached code-screenshot - it is found in 2 places on the page for 2 spark interpreters, 
 - spark
 - spark-local

and one is visible (that we are editing) and one is not.

My guess that it picks non-visible from time to time, and this way fails the test, as code logic is to wait until it becomes visible for 5 sec (in order the page to load), but this never happens as it's second one that is visible.

    ZEPPELIN-928: fix flaky ZeppelinIT test for Spark interpreter

    ### What is this PR for?
    Fix flaky Integration Test by adding new id to HTML (as of HTML5 it can be [any non-empty string](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-id-attribute)) and liverage it in tests for simpler XPath statements that pick only 1 candidate.
    
    ### TODO
     - [x] fix test
     - [x] update New Interpreter form validation and error message
     
    ### What type of PR is it?
    Bug Fix
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    [ZEPPELIN-928](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-928)
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    CI should pass
    
    
    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update? No
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? No
    * Does this needs documentation? No
