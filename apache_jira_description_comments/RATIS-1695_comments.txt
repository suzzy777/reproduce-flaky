One step further down this thread, there's much more we can do to further improve the state exposed on the RaftServer. For each critical operation, if that fails, it can manually set the state on the RaftServer and transition that to EXCEPTION. Currently that transition is not triggered very often, we are underusing the EXCEPTION state.

The pull request #747 is now merged.  Thanks, [~jiacheliu3]!

Could you file any JIRA for the remaining work?
