We would like to augment the existing Google Cloud SpannerIO connector ([https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/spanner/SpannerIO.java)] with the support for Spanner Change Streams (CDC). CDC support is just being implemented in Spanner and it will be exposed through a gRPC API. We will use such API to create a new SpannerIO.readChangeStream(...) implementation.
