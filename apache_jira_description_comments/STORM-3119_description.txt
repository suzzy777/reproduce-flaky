I think we should add Java 10 to the build matrix.

Storm-cassandra and storm-hive are expected not to work for now, because Cassandra and Hive aren't compatible with Java 9 yet, but the rest of Storm should work (Hadoop-based components may or may not work though, I believe they are still working on compatibility, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11123). We can exclude those two components from the Java 10 build for now.
