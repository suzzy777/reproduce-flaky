It should be possible to adjust the logger configuration to suppress those logs? We need CI coverage.

Maybe this helps:

[~thomasWeise] We can use this in KafkaOutputOperatorTest but not in KafkaInputOperatorTest. Because, EmbeddedZookeeper supports only for single cluster. It doesn't work for multiple clusters. So, this can't be used it for multi-cluster test cases which are present in KafkaInputOperatorTest. Is it fine to add it only in KafkaOutputOperatorTest ?

Existing Kafka operator tests are flaky.




Why can we not use multiple embedded zookeepers with different ports when the goal is to simulate multiple clusters?

There are almost constant CI failure due to the recently added 0.10 tests, will submit PR to turn them off until tests are in a better shape..

The Kafka example tests are also flaky and cause CI to fail frequently, hard coded port numbers are one issue:
