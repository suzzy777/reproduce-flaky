    [ZEPPELIN-2326] - Updating Geode dependencies and imports due to package rename

    ### What is this PR for?
    Updating Geode dependencies and imports due to package rename - ZEPPELIN-2326

    Refactoring
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2326
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    Same tests. One test (`oqlPdxInstanceResponse`) was failing before this change and it's still failing...  Looks like a problem with the mock response, but I've not looked further. All remaining tests are passing.

    Hi @markito Thanks for your contribution and taking care of Geode interpreter. 
    
     - Zeppelin build system relies on travis. So please setup your travis account and travis project for Zeppelin.
     - Please take a look https://zeppelin.apache.org/contribution/contributions.html#continuous-integration
     - The repository name must be Zeppelin (not incubator-zeppelin, ...)
     - It's not mandatory to pass all tests to be reviewed. But some reviewers might select passed PRs first
    
    Trigger travis CI by pushing new commits or amend your last commit (git commit --amend and git push your-remote HEAD --force) after setup your travis.

    I am not sure but the failed test is due to one of flaky tests. Please restart it.
