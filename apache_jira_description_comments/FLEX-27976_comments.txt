The reason List and ViewTransition failures happen in the main runs is because the Nexus S device locks up for over a minute during some garbage collections when the Flex application's System.privateMemory reaches over 100MB.  This causes the whole SWF to timeout and bail so half of the List tests are not even run.

This problem appears to be specific to only the Nexus S device and we should be able to quickly remedy this by changing our main run device back to a Nexus One.

This is a short-term fix for removing a device that seems to be flaky.  There still appears to be an underlying memory problem on all devices where  System.privateMemory can go above 130MB in the List test app.  This is a lot of memory and it isn't yet clear if this possible leak is in the application, Mustella, the Flex SDK, or the runtime.  I've been slowly investigating further to try and narrow it down.  In the mean time the List tests have been excluded to this bug to get the runs clean for the CAB drop.

To me to swap out the device on the mustella machine

Check with Steve to see if we can share the data he collected with the rt teams in the form of a bug.

to Steve to check when the mem leak is fixed (which should be shortly)

Resolving as obsolete. Memory leak is fixed.  We should confirm these failures are also resolved.

Re-included all List tests. Closing.
