Hi [~mainakghosh], thank you for your investigation, if you're interested in contributing, feel free to assign this to yourself - you can find more info on the process here: [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute]

As for the review, either the reviewboard or a github PR @ [https://github.com/apache/hive] is welcome.

 

Cheers,

David

I have created the PR, [https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/631]. 

Thank you, a few more things we'll need to do to make this complete:
 * Your example seems like a good unit test. Could you add it as a q file to your commit? You can find more info at [Query Unit Test|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute#HowToContribute-QueryUnitTest]
 * Is this resolved in the current Hive version? (4.0.0-SNAPSHOT) If this is unique to Hive 2.x only, you'll need to submit your patch here for *branch-2*
 * We have a green run policy for new commits, which means you need to submit your patch in this Jira and an automation will check your code. The patch has to bee iterated until all tests pass in the precommit job. (Note here, that some tests tend to be flaky, so multiple resubmits of the same patch is possible, if the failed tests are unrelated.) See [Creating a patch|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute#HowToContribute-CreatingaPatch]

Thanks David. I will add the unit test and the patch after following the documentation you shared. Does the code review depend on these steps?

I am not sure whether the problem occurs in the current Hive version. I would assume it does as the original code has not changed in the current version either. Can you help me test it in the new version?

 

These steps along with an apache commiter's +1 approval on this ticket - which is kind of the result of the review - are needed to make it eligable for merging. Merging is also done by commiters.

Still interested in working on this?

Can you please create PR against master?

Oh wow, this just fell through the cracks. Yes I would love to have this pushed but unfortunately I have not worked on Hive for some time. I have created the PR against master [https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/1130].
