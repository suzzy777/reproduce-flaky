[~gezapeti], as we have discussed, I am taking over this issue.

Sure, please go ahead.
As we've discussed I believe the fix is correct, but something is off in the tests. I could no figure out what though and had no time to continue to work on it.

In case of _testSubWorkflowRerun_ the workflow got stuck in RUNNING state, I don`t know yet why, but I think this is the cause of the another test failure as well.

Thanks for the contribution [~kmarton]! Reviewed on RB. Please investigate whether {{TestSubWorkflowActionExecutor#testSubWorkflowRerun()}} is failing when run multiple times locally / on {{dist_test}}.

Thank you @Andras for the review. I have uploaded a new patch, with the review fix. Now I am running the tests multiple times to find out if the TestSubWorkflowActionExecutor#testSubWorkflowRerun() will fail or not. I will post my findings soon.

I ran the TestSubWorkflowActionExecutor locally 10 times and with grind 100 times, without test failures, so I think that it can be considered OK :)

Also, I have uploaded a new patch,  with some final modifiers added.

committed to master!
Thanks [~kmarton] for ironing out the tests! I got really confused by them :)

Closing issue; Oozie 5.1.0 is released.
