The next TensorFlow releases starting from 2.0 introduce significant structure changes: all code from contribution module will be moved into separate sub-projects. Our "TensorFlow on Apache Ignite" integration code in contribution module is also moving into so called "tensorflow/io" sub-project (see [https://github.com/tensorflow/io]).

Almost all things related to this movement is already done by community members. We need to check that "TensorFlow on Apache Ignite" is still working after the movement, clarify details about "tensorflow/io" review/build/publish procedures including Windows build which is not supported so far.
