[~cmccabe], could you take a look at this bug? If you are busy, you can also guide me where to look into. Thank you.

[~showuon]: thanks for looking at this.  This test failure has been frustrating everyone for a while.  It's great that you reproduced it with DEBUG logging.

bq. The raftCluster always send to the wrong active controller and never update

Hmm... If you do a grep for "Recorded new controller" you can see that it does change eventually.

Maybe the question is why it takes so long to change our view of the controller on the broker side? That comes directly out of the raft client on the broker. cc [~hachikuji]

Another question is whether we should use the information passed back by the standby controller to fail over quicker.  You can see this in the error that was returned:

{code}
"errorCode":41,"errorMessage":"The active controller appears to be node 3000"
{code}

We could potentially try node 3000 after receiving that error (although this might complicate things in other ways...)

[~cmccabe], I've found the root cause of this issue, and have a fix to it. Do you mind if I take over this ticket? Thank you.

Go for it [~showuon]
