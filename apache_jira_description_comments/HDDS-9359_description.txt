HDDS-9357 introduced a new workflow to easily run some intermittent test in multiple iterations.  Currently it has the default {{fail-fast: true}} behavior for the matrix check, but {{FAIL_FAST=false}} for iterations within a split.  The goal of this task is to add a new parameter to the workflow to ensure these two are consistent.  This will allow running all splits to completion, which helps estimate the rate of failure.
