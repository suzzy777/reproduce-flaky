It is possible that two tests running in parallel use the same input topic. May also be a problem with other postcommit tests running in parallel.

I'll check whether the same topic is being used.

I think this error is caused because a pubsub message can be send multiple times if the message is not acknowledged in time. The default deadline is 10 seconds. If the tests are run in parallel I think it is possible that the deadline is missed sometimes. I created a pr [https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8752] where the deadline is incremented to 60 seconds

Thanks, [~Juta]. This explanation makes sense to me, and we do randomize the topic with a random uuid suffix, so a topic collision is unlikely. 

[~Juta] it seems that this can be lcosed right?

Let's close and reopen if this happens again.
