Found a fix for this issue. Can be found here:

[https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1452/files]

 

As a backup, I am also attaching a patch.

[^0001-Fix-Flaky-testNoSuchRepairSessionAnticompaction-trunk.patch]

Problem is that sometimes the session state value changed to FAILED state between the moment it was checked as non failed and the moment it was being updated, leading to an ilegal transition (from FAILED to PREPARED).

The way I was able to repro it was:
* to tell intelliJ to keep running the same test until it failed. It failed always after between 2 and 6 runs. 
* Running a simple bash script until it failed. Same results.

That allowed me to investigate the logs and chase that. After adding the synchronize, I couldn’t make the test fail again. Also, thinking about it, it makes perfect sense to put that block into a synchronized block, as it is reading a variable that is being updated from other threads.

Hi [~bernardo.botella],

I just saw you posted a patch but the ticket was still in triage so I moved it to Patch Available to signal people it needs a reviewer. 

Thank you for your work!

The code gets fixed was added in 4.0. A patch is needed for the 4.0 branch. [~bernardo.botella], can you also provide a patch to 4.0 branch?

+1 on the patch.

Dropped a couple comments.
