Hi, Alexey,

If this test can hangs rarely then we need to do mass run for this test. Please, create separate PR with suite filled with at least 100 instances of this test and run it on TeamCity.

Here is PR: [https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/4923]

Here is TC task: [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_CacheFailover2&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F4923%2Fhead&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv]

 

it must failed with timeout exception but earlier than 2 hours

Code looks good for me. I started [RunAll|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=2034621&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll] to make sure that PR breaks nothing.

[~SomeFire], [~aplatonov], Igniters,
Any news on the ticket? Today is the last day when we are ready to keep non-blocker tickets on AI 2.7. Otherwise stability of AI 2.7 might be compromised. Please make sure to either merge the ticket today, or move it to the next version.

[~aplatonov], please, pull the master and check [this tests|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=2034563].

[~SomeFire]

I have pulled master but I don't understand how failed test in this suites are related with my pull-request. It seems to these fails was due to some other reasons.

They could appear in random commit and looks like they are fixed, because they don't fail in the master. So, master refresh will remove them from [blockers|https://mtcga.gridgain.com/pr.html?serverId=apache&suiteId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll&baseBranchForTc=&branchForTc=pull%2F4859%2Fhead&action=Latest].

[~SomeFire], it seems to be ok

Test looks flaky, but last fail was a week ago.

This code doesn't even call run-async in tests. I see no reasons for investigating this situation.

Hmm

It's interesting

[https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewQueued.html?itemId=2061463] - this test was success

[TeamCity Run All|http://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=2051438&amp;buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll]

This is indeed a flaky test not related to the change, now looks good.

Merged to master.
