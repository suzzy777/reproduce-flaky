Currently it looks like this:

$ ldapsearch -h localhost -p 389 -D "uid=admin,ou=system" -w ****** -b "dc=example,dc=com" -s base "(objectClass=*)"
version: 1
dn: dc=example,dc=com
dc: example
ObjectClass: domain
ObjectClass: extensibleObject
ObjectClass: top

Although obviously not important: I would expect attribute "objectClass" here (as it is called in the schema). The issue arises with all entries, newly created ones  as well.
