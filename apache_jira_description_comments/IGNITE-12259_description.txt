The actual spring version is [5.2.0.RELEASE|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-context/5.2.0.RELEASE], spring data version is [2.2.0.RELEASE.|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.data/spring-data-commons/2.2.0.RELEASE]

It would be nice to add a module to support these versions.
