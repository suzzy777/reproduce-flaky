    SAMZA-1191: Fixed flaky test: TestExponentialSleepStrategy testThreadInterruptInRetryLoop

    It's possible that the interruptee thread (see `#interruptedThread`) gets pre-empted before it has a chance to run the operation (increment `iterations`) and then gets interrupted, causing these assertions to fail.
    
    I think these assertions also aren't critical for the tests which I presume want to test interrupt propagation behavior, so removing them in this change.
    
    @vjagadish1989 & @xinyuiscool, please take a look.
