Adding support for multiple permissions for GRANT/REVOKE grammar.

PR: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1258

Thanks for the patch [~frankgh]. :-)

There is some addition that are needed to the current patch (unfortunately they that are not necessary obvious for somebody new to the codebase):
* The new {{RoleSyntaxTest}} tests ensure that the syntax is valid but do not validate that the permissions are effectively taken into account by the system. So it will be great to add a test validating that the permissions are effectively taken into account.
* CQLSH has its own parsing logic for autocompletion in {{pylib/cqlshlib/cql3handling.py}} and the test to validate autocompletion are in {{pylib/cqlshlib/test/test_cqlsh_completion.py}}
* As it is an improvements we should add an entry in the {{NEWS.txt}} for 4.1

I have just created a patch for CASSANDRA-17027 that add some tests similar to what is needed for the first two points. My advise to you would be to build your patch on top of my branch and to modify the {{GrantAndRevokeTest}} unit test and the {{test_complete_in_grant}} and {{test_complete_in_revoke}} autocompletion tests in {{test_cqlsh_completion}}.

Once you have done those changes if you are looking for another patch I would suggest you CASSANDRA-10537 :-)    



[~blerer] The `RoleSyntaxTest` class is exactly what I was looking for, so thank you for adding that. I will address your feedback and will update my PR.

[~blerer] I have pushed a new commit to my PR. My PR now sits on top of your branch. I modified the existing tests in {{GrantAndRevokeTest}} as opposed to adding new tests. Let me know if that is ok. 

It is fine.

[~blerer] let me know if there is any additional feedback on my PR. I'm waiting for your PR to get merged to rebase.

[~frankgh] thanks for the patch. Left a nit on the test. Overall it looks good to me. 

Triggered CI at https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/yifan-c/cassandra?branch=r%2Fpr1258

+1 on the patch. 

There are some (flaky) test failures from the CI run, but are not related to the patch. 

The patch looks good to me.
