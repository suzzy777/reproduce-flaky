The markdown4j library doesn't support table syntax currently. (https://github.com/JustinSDK/markdown4j/blob/wiki/ProjectHome.md)

Maybe we could implement a table plugin for markdown4j based on the existing work like https://github.com/zhenchuan/txtmark/commit/178486805e78e3d572b071ca8b9f8887a066edef

I think it would be more easier and reliable way to use well-managed markdown libraries such as pegdown if the license doesn't matter (https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown/)

    @1ambda Thank you for the contribution! I just shortly look through the screenshot in the description, but comparing to Github markdown support it seems Zeppelin's table doesn't have a table border. If I make the below table in Github,
    
    ```
    | Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
    |----------|:-------------:|------:|
    | col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
    | col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
    | col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
    ```
    
    it will be shown like this.

    But in Zeppelin it doesn't have the border.

    The change of library looks great to me, üëç  for having a test case!
    
    Few things to take care of, before merging it:
     - for all the code, please make sure it follows project [styleguide\code conventions](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-convention)
     - as you add a new dependency - it will become a part of the next release convenience binary for Zeppelin and in order to be included, we need to verify it's licence compatibility. Can you please add it to `zeppelin-distribution/src/licence_bin/LICENSE`
     - also, applying some styles for such tables, as noted by @AhyoungRyu sounds like a good improvement as well


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    I will refine this PR. 
    
    Thanks for the detailed and significant review :) @AhyoungRyu @bzz 



Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    Thanks @1ambda for the improvement.
    
    Regarding license, 'markdown4j' section in the `zeppelin-distribution/src/licence_bin/LICENSE` should be removed while the library is no longer included in the binary package.
    
    Also `pegdown` library does have some transitive dependencies and they also need to be addressed in `zeppelin-distribution/src/licence_bin/LICENSE`. @1ambda Could you take care of them if they're not already addressed in `zeppelin-distribution/src/licence_bin/LICENSE`?

Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    @Leemoonsoo Thanks!
    
    I'v added missing transitive deps and removed unused markdown4j dep. 
    
    I also found that `org.ow2.asm:asm:jar:3.0.1` is described in `zeppelin-distribution/src/licence_bin/LICENSE` But already denoted license is different version (3.0.1) compared to pegdown's dependency (5.0.3). 
    
    Should I updated `org.ow2.asm:asm:jar:3.0.1` to `org.ow2.asm:asm:jar:5.0.3`?

    MArkdown4j supports YUML and Websequence, does this support the same?


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    @felixcheung 
    
    Pegdown doesn't support YUML, Websequence and Include plugins according to [Pegdown Extensions](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown/blob/master/src/main/java/org/pegdown/Extensions.java)
    
    I think we have 2 options. (or more)
    
    1. Use markdown4j and implement [table plugins](https://github.com/jdcasey/markdown4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/markdown4j/TablePlugin.java) correctly. 
    ** we might need small effort, but we will depend on markdown4j which is not actively developed.
    ** and other markdown syntaxes might be implemented if necessary.
    
    2. Use pegdown and implement [YUML](https://github.com/billy1380/markdown4j-gwt/blob/master/src/main/java/org/markdown4j/YumlPlugin.java), [Websequence](https://github.com/jdcasey/markdown4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/markdown4j/WebSequencePlugin.java).
    
    



Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    @AhyoungRyu  In regard to table style, 
    
    Using CSS (e.g [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css))  would be better solution rather than adding inline style to DOMs such as`table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tr`, `td` while parsing. 


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    Now markdown table looks like
    
    <img width="338" alt="screen shot 2016-09-01 at 3 03 02 am" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4968473/18141148/54414ab6-6ff3-11e6-897d-94dab08e6516.png">
    
    



Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    Personally YUML and Websequence is very handy - I use them quite a bit.
    What do other think about this?


Github user AhyoungRyu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    @1ambda Yeah it's good idea to apply github markdown style to Zeppelin. I tested again and it works well. Definitely better than before! 
    
    But I found little bit wired behavior when I made a title. 
    
    ```
    ## This is second level title
    ### This is third level title
    ```
    
    This title code makes a link and it's connected to Zeppelin home. Is it intended?

Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384

    It was due to the `ANCHORLINK` option in pegdown. I removed it.

Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    Regarding @felixcheung's comment, 
    
    I think keeping backward compatibility is always very important.
    If i add more possible options after @1ambda 's 
    
     - Create new interpreter %pd that uses pegdown and restore %md to use markdown4j
     - Add a interpreter property that selects markdown library pegdown/markdown4j.


Github user AhyoungRyu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    @1ambda Yeah tested again and it looks goodüëç  Thanks!  
    (One more thing: [Zeppelin's Java block indentation size](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.2-block-indentation) is `2 spaces`  :D )


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    @Leemoonsoo 
    
    I think **option 2** (Adding a property) is a better solution. because
    
    1) Adding a new interpreter just for support another markdown parser might be confusing to users
    2) Pegdown parser will be able to replace markdown4j parser soon if we implement YUML and Websequence. At that time, we can just modify the parser property of `md` interpreter instead of requesting for users to change their interpreter type


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    I'v restored markdown4j parser and add `markdown.parser.type` property to `md` group. Pegdown parser will be used only if user specify `pegdown` property value.

    One more question. It seems that `description` does't show even if i already provide in `markdown/src/main/resources/interpreter-setting.json` like 
    
    ```json
    [
      {
        "group": "md",
        "name": "md",
        "className": "org.apache.zeppelin.markdown.MarkdownInterpreter",
        "properties": {
          "markdown.parser.type": {
            "envName": "MARKDOWN_PARSER_TYPE",
            "propertyName": "markdown.parser.type",
            "defaultValue": "markdown4j",
            "description": "Markdown Parser Type. Available values: markdown4j, pegdown. Default = markdown4j"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
    ```
     


Github user AhyoungRyu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    @1ambda Great! It works well as expected üëç 
    
    If you want to add the interpreter property(`markdown.parser.type`) to the markdown interpreter, it would be better to provide that information via [Zeppelin markdown interpreter docs](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/interpreter/markdown.html) with configuration table as like the other interpreters do. Nothing much needed. You can just add the below conf table to `markdown.md`.
    ```
    ## Configuration
    <table class="table-configuration">
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Default Value</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>markdown.parser.type</td>
        <td>markdown4j </td>
        <td>Markdown Parser Type. <br/> Available values: markdown4j, pegdown.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    ```
    
    Also the below sentences in [Overview section](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/interpreter/markdown.html#overview) need to be updated accordingly. 
    >Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML. Apache Zeppelin uses markdown4j. For more examples and extension support, please checkout here.
    
    FYI, `markdown.md` file is under `ZEPPELIN_HOME/docs/interpreter/` :)

    >It seems that description does't show even though i provide it to markdown/src/main/resources/interpreter-setting.json like
    
    yeah I also felt uncomfortable when create/edit a interpreter. There is no way to get information what these properties are working for. It would be better to add `description` column separately to the interpreter setting table I think. But it can be handled in the different PR :)


Github user corneadoug commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    @1ambda Usually to include external source css, we would use the `assets/styles` folder.
    
    However in this case, you can use bower to have it part of the build instead of the source code, by using `bower install --save github-markdown-css`



Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    @corneadoug Thanks! 
    
    I'v installed github markdown css and added it to `bower.json` using the command you provided. 
    It is definitely better to use bower if possible :)


Github user corneadoug commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    @Leemoonsoo @felixcheung Are we good on that PR?
    CI is failing on tests, not related to this PR as its happening to other PRs.
    But would be better to merge this one after CI is fixed


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    looks fine to me, I'd defer to others on licensing. thanks for the great contribution!


Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    Because now github-markdown-css is downloaded on build time instead of packed in the source tree, related license now need to moved back to under bin_licenses. 


Github user bzz commented on the issue:

    @1ambda üëç  fot tests, looks great to me except for licensing issue raised by Moon and small comment above.
    
    If you could let me know you user name in ASF JIRA I'll be happy to help assigning ZEPPELIN-1387 to you.


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384
  
    @Leemoonsoo I'v fixed license description. Also, now I understand when to describe licenses to `licenses` or `bin_licenses`. Thanks. :)
    
    @bzz I think it is better to use more specific exception types in catch block as you pointed out. Could you review e08929a again? 


Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    [ZEPPELIN-1387] Support table syntax in markdown interpreter

    ### What is this PR for?
    
    Support table markdown syntax issued by [ZEPPELIN-1387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1387?jql=project%20%3D%20ZEPPELIN)
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    [Bug Fix | Improvement]
    
    This PR can be categorized as bug fix and improvement since it not only resolves the above issue but also support other markdown syntaxes.
    
    ### Todos
    * [ ] - Check the license issue of the [pegdown](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown) library introduced by this PR
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    
    [ZEPPELIN-1387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1387?jql=project%20%3D%20ZEPPELIN)
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    
    Write markdown texts and compare them with expected html DOMs. I'v also included some tests for this PR.
    
    ### Screenshots (if appropriate)
    
    <img width="708" alt="markdown" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4968473/18061274/1f2be526-6e5d-11e6-9f1a-3528f3958d2c.png">
    
    ### Questions:
    
    * Does the licenses files need update?
    * Does coding style is appropriate?
    
    ### Additional Comments
    
    We might solve this issue by implementing custom table plugin for markdown4j by referring [the existing work of txtmark](https://github.com/zhenchuan/txtmark/commit/178486805e78e3d572b071ca8b9f8887a066edef). 
    But I think it is not good idea in regard to coverage, maintainability and efficiency since markdown4j is currently not developed actively and it costs to implement all markdown plugins which is not supported by markdown4j.
