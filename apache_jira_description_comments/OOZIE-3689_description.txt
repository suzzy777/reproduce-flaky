Currently usages of `commons-httpclient` can be found `TestHAShareLibService`'s unit test, however, `commons-httpclient` is in EOL state.
Oozie at this moment does not pull it in directly, but used from a transitive dependency.
The goal of this ticket is to modify the test inside `TestHAShareLibService` not to use `commons-httpclient`.
NOTE: this change only introduces a unit test change and does not contains production change.
