Here's my initial attempt at a fix, mainly focusing on...

* adding comments
* adding logging 
* renaming variables to be more explict what we're expecting
* tightening up the call to {{findLeaderReplicaWithDuplicatedName}} so we explictly look for the leader of shard1 since that's what we assert against later
* add extra asserts that shard2 doesn't have an election either (the existing asserts only checked the second collection)


With this fix, the test *seems* to pass a little more often -- but it's still easy to get a diff type of failure that i was also suspicious would be very plausible given the existing code...

The entire premise of {{findLeaderReplicaWithDuplicatedName}} is that we can find "a leader" from collection1 with the same {{Replica.getName()}} as a Replica from collection2 -- but IIUC there's no garuntee that will be true.

Here's an example failure with the patch applied...

Note:
* that seed won't reproduce reliably, because the leader node _might_ randomly have the sane name as one of the replicas from the other collection)
* In the particular log above, if we did out testing/assertions against col1+shard2 instead of col1+shard1 then we'd get lucky and find the coreNodeName overlap with col2 thta the test expects -- but unless i'm missing something that's still just a fluke and not something we can depend upon

I'm not really sure how to make this test work reliably? ... unless maybe we manually add replicas with explicitly specified {{coreNodeName}} and force them to be the leader????


[~shalin] & [~caomanhdat] - it looks like you guys worked on this test as part of SOLR-5245 ... any suggestions how to make it work reliably based on the problems i've diagnosed?

bq. I'm not really sure how to make this test work reliably? ... unless maybe we manually add replicas with explicitly specified coreNodeName and force them to be the leader????

FWIW, the attached {{SOLR-11469_incomplete_and_broken.patch}} attempts this, but i ran into SOLR-11479 which currently makes this impossible.

Patch for this ticket. Beasted 150 times. The idea here is if will create two collection with same sequence of requests ( no parallel ). We will have same replica names for each collection. ( This satisfy current logic of Assign.buildCoreNodeName )

SOLR-11469: LeaderElectionContextKeyTest has flawed logic: 50% of the time it checks the wrong shard's elections


bq. We will have same replica names for each collection. ( This satisfy current logic of Assign.buildCoreNodeName )

Hmmm... i'm -0 having the test make these assumptions.  Fundementally this is the same problem the test had before: it makes assumptions about the lower level implementation of how/when coreNodeMakes will be assigned that the client code used in the test doesn't have any control over -- and doesn't directly validate.  if/when the implementation changes the test _may_ start failing in unpredictable ways.

Can we please at least add some sanity check assertions to this test that will look at the clusterstate and fail with a clear error message if the audo-assigned coreNodeNames don't match the expectations of the test?

[~hossman] Yeah, It seems a good idea. If someone changes low-level implementation that causes test's assumption invalid, the test must be failed 100%
