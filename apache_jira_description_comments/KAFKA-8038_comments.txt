URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6377
 
 
   There is tiny timing window in the test where server has not marked the channel ready, but client has. Wait for server to mark the channel ready.
   
   I wasn't able to recreate the failure with or without the fix. The fix is based on the stack trace in the JIRA.
