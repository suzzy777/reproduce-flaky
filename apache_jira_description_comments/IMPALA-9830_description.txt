A few test runs have seen this failure in TestMtDopScanNode.test_mt_dop_scan_node():

    assert "- BytesRead: 0" not in result.runtime_profile, result.runtime_profile{noformat}
This test is run in a loop due to IMPALA-9655. We may need to increase the number of loops or rethink the conditions of the test.
