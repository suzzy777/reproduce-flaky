Both hintedhandoff and getendpoints had a 2nd command added that does the exact thing but rewritten (and in getReplicas not as well) not just aliased (like cf->tablestats). Also a minor cleanup is same command added multiple times to nodetool command list. We should clean this up before 4.0 release before people become reliant on the newly introduced command name. If we want them renamed as that we should rename and link with alias like we do with cf->table others.
