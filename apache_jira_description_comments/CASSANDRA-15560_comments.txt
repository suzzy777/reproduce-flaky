[~jrwest]do you mind I take this one?

That would be great! I was hoping to have time but other tickets have taken higher priority. Happy to be a reviewer.Â 

Waiting on CASSANDRA-15739 to see if I can get a clean-ish CI run.

PR available [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/547]

Your CI runs were a little noisy (timeouts, etc) so I ran with a beefier config and it looks like you broke the test_compression_cql_options test: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/27/workflows/896fefed-5707-4da0-882d-ca5a29abab58/jobs/177

It may be that the test just needs to be updated.

[~brandon.williams] thank you for reviewing this. Indeed the dtests were very noisy and I was worried about it so any guidance is welcomed. That particular test I ran locally and it passed before I pushed. I tested again and it passes in my branch:

I bisected it to [9c1bbf3ac913f9bdf7a0e0922106804af42d2c1e|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/9c1bbf3ac913f9bdf7a0e0922106804af42d2c1e] CASSANDRA-15379. The dtests in there, if I managed to make myself around circleci correctly, don't seem to have ran the compression test.

Also I looked at your CI results and tried to match them to [jenkins|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk-dtest-novnode/] but the latest runs seem to have failed. I did run locally some of the failing tests against trunck and they also failed. I _think_ we're safe to merge this PR and open a new ticket for the compression test failure due to 15379. But my circleci/dtests reasonable failures knowledge is very limited. Wdyt?

Nice detective work!  I think you're right, and since that's the only problem I found, I committed this.  Thanks!
