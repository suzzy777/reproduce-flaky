Similar to {{SUBSCRIBE}} and {{UNSUBSCRIBE}}, {{PSUBSCRIBE}} allows a client to subscribe to a pattern. For example:
{noformat}
PSUBSCRIBE sal*s
{noformat}

The subscription pattern is in the form of a glob supporting {{*}}, {{?}} and ranges. https://redis.io/commands/psubscribe

Pattern subscriptions must be unsubscribed verbatim. i.e., the above subscription would not be unsubscribed using the pattern {{s*}}, but must be unsubscribed using the complete subscribed pattern, namely {{sal*s}}.

When clients subscribe to overlapping patterns (or channels) they will receive a message for every matched subscription. Matches for a single client are not conflated.
