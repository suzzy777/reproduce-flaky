We've run into failures in this test in our internal jobs a few times. They look like this:

{noformat}
java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: expected full outer join to not spill, but did
      at scala.Predef$.assert(Predef.scala:170)
      at org.apache.spark.TestUtils$.assertNotSpilled(TestUtils.scala:189)
      at org.apache.spark.sql.JoinSuite$$anonfun$23$$anonfun$apply$mcV$sp$16.apply$mcV$sp(JoinSuite.scala:734)
      at org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestUtils$class.withSQLConf(SQLTestUtils.scala:108)
{noformat}

I looked on the riselab jenkins and couldn't find a failure, so filing with a low priority.

I did notice a possible race in the code that could explain the failure. Will send a PR.
