Here are a few sample build failures caused by this test case:

# https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/52164/testReport/org.apache.spark.sql.sources/ParquetHadoopFsRelationSuite/test_all_data_types___ByteType/
# https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/52154/testReport/org.apache.spark.sql.sources/ParquetHadoopFsRelationSuite/test_all_data_types___ByteType/
# https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/52153/testReport/org.apache.spark.sql.sources/ParquetHadoopFsRelationSuite/test_all_data_types___ByteType/

(I've pinned these builds on Jenkins so that they won't be cleaned up.)
