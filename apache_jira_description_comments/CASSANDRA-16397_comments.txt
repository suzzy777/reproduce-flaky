[~mck] do You remember such behavior maybe?

It looks to be a new failure… (though I can't see how the setup of skipped tests was happening before but isn't now 🤷🏻‍♀️)

{code}
E           AttributeError: 'Function' object has no attribute 'rep_call'dtest_setup.py:351: AttributeError
{code}

Patch at https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/compare/trunk...thelastpickle:mck/16397 

Just add additional check that 'rep_call' exists, i.e. the test was setup. If it wasn't setup then we know it hasn't failed.

LGTM.

I confirmed manually that indeed it fixes the problem and code looks good.

Thanks [~tomasz.lasica] for the report!
