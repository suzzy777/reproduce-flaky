[~ram_krish], do you think you could have a look at this one?
It might just need a bit more time for the changes to propagate into ZK...?


Here's a failed run: https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-0.94/847/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver/TestSplitTransactionOnCluster/testSplitBeforeSettingSplittingInZK/

Ok Lars.. i will check this out.  May be by today evening :)

Thanks Ram, this seems to happen on slow machines. The last run on ubuntu3 finished in almost 1/2 of the time of the previous four runs.


Started looking into it. the logs seems confusing.  Deletion of the table has happened but after that a split request comes.  Will look into more closely later today.

Ok i found the root cause of the issue.
In the 3 runs that has failed the failure is from 'if' condition and the other 2 times it is from 'else' condition.
{code}
if (nodeCreated) {
        assertFalse(ZKUtil.checkExists(regionServer.getZooKeeper(), node) == -1);
      } else {
        assertTrue(ZKUtil.checkExists(regionServer.getZooKeeper(), node) == -1);
      }
{code}
The reason is because of 2 things
-> The createTable though it has added the META entry but still the znode deletion from RS_ZK_OPENED state has not happened.
-> Another is because the testcase throws an IOException either from transitionNodeSplitting or createNodeSplitting based on the condition.
And the testcases catches the IOException and acts on it.
Consider the case where we are in the 'if' conditon ie. we want the nodeCreated to be true.
Now the test tries to create the SPLIT node as part of SplitTransaction.  Because the OPENED node is still there and it has not been deleted by the AM, the creation of the znode in SPLIT state actually fails.  But the testcase tries to catch the exception and tries to assert the existence of the znode.
Ideally it tries to catch the exception that should be have come from transitionNodeSplitting (). Now before he could assert AM deletes the znode in OPENED state.
So the assert in 'if' fails.
Similar should be the case with 'else' which i have not analysed fully.  
@Lars
I will come up with a patch for this and may be some modifications to the testcase also.

Thanks Ram!

nice tracking [~ram_krish]

Modified the testcase to handle this scenario.  Even by the new wait introduced if the znode does not get deleted atleast the assertion will tell us the failure was due to Node already existing while creating SPLIT node.

Patch looks good.

@Lars
If you are ok with the patch can you commit it.  I have some infrastructure issues that prevents me from going on with commit.

Yep... Will commit in a bit.

This is different in trunk. Have no time to do that right now. Will do this evening.

Attaching trunk patch.  The format in the patch seems different.  In the code if i see it is in the expected way.  Not sure why it is happening.

Minor comments:
{code}
+	private static class CreateSplittingNodeFailedException extends IOException {
+		public CreateSplittingNodeFailedException() {
{code}
The indentation should be corrected.
Would SplittingNodeCreationFailedException be a better name ?
{code}
+        // check for the specific instance incase the Split failed due to the
{code}
'incase' -> 'in case'
{code}
+        // This will atleast make the test to fail;
{code}
atleast -> 'at least'

Updated patch.  Sorry for not addressing the comments last time.  I was just trying to get the indentation right.
