Who could investigate this? /cc [~kenn][~tysonjh]

Good idea to link Jenkins jobs. If you log in there is a button (for me anyhow) that says "Keep This Build Forever" so then it can be referenced. You can also link Gradle scans.

In light of Kenn's comment do we even have a way to debug this without a jenkins job link?

Unless there is an objection, I will close this next time I make a pass on the flaky tests. It does not sound like we have enough debugging information.

Hello! Due to a bug in our Jira configuration, this issue had status:Resolved but resolution:Unresolved.

I am bulk editing these issues to have resolution:Fixed

If a different resolution is appropriate, please change it. To do this, click the "Resolve" button (you can do this even for closed issues) and set the Resolution field to the right value.
