There are other mismatches as well. Using mySql I've got the following errors:

[~abhishekbafna], do you have any plans with this issue? I can take it over, if you have other priorities :)

[~abhishekbafna], I would take this over if you don't mind.

 

In OOZIE-1717 new composite indices were added (manually, not via annotations), but the schema checker handles only the those defined with annotations. 

Those columns which are part of some composite indices, but they are not single column ones, those will be reported by the Schema checker as extra indices.

The FindBug reported bug is not introduced by the patch, is already existing one. Also, the update String doesn't have user defined parts, it is hardcoded.

Thanks [~kmarton]! Can you please use [*{{\@SuppressFBWarnings}}*|http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/api/edu/umd/cs/findbugs/annotations/SuppressFBWarnings.html] on method level in case FindBugs errors are not applicable? Thanks!
