Hi [~dionusos]  could you please relaunch the PreCommit tests? Looks like we were hitting heap space issues at the time of the PreCommit run.

Thank you

PreCommit-OOZIE-Build started


[~jmakai] restarted. I think we should investigate this heap issue more deeply. Could you please open a Jira for it? It seems 2GiB of memory is not enough:
{code:bash}
export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx2048m {code}
Thanks

Thank you, sure. I've opened OOZIE-3711 for it.

[~jmakai] I restarted the test run but I think you should check the 
{noformat}
1. -> at org.apache.oozie.server.TestJspHandler.scratchDir_Cannot_Be_Created_When_Setup_Called_And_ScratchDir_Did_Not_Exist(TestJspHandler.java:78) {noformat}
message. On my machine removing that mocking solved the problem.

Thank you [~dionusos], looks like I've added unnecessary stubbing into the`scratchDir_Cannot_Be_Created_When_Setup_Called_And_ScratchDir_Did_Not_Exist` by mistake. I've removed it and the test passes locally. Also uploaded a new patch containing this slight change.
