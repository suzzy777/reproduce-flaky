HTrace is not perfectly integrated into HBase, the version 3.2.0 is buggy, the upgrade to 4.x is not trivial and would take time. It might not worth to keep it in this state, so would be better to remove it.

Of course it doesn't mean tracing would be useless, just that in this form the use of HTrace 3.2 might not add any value to the project and fixing it would be far too much effort.

Based on the decision of the community we keep htrace now and update version
