I tried to repo with no luck:
- With sleeps
- With  the RepeatableRunner
- With [5K repeats|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/1046/workflows/0387b2f4-2fbd-450f-a45f-5310b9d084c4/jobs/26513] on circle
- Some hacks

Also the original repo link/logs are not available anymore. I vote closing this one as 'can't repro' until it comes up again. Wdyt?

10K runs for 5.0 and trunk don't reproduce it either:

 * 4.0: [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/3196/workflows/5a0dd468-8ff1-4af2-acc2-84900fbcff29]
 * trunk: [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/3197/workflows/ad967712-974c-4742-93d6-361caea11bcb]

Those runs don't hit the related CASSANDRA-17475 either.

Butler reports other relatively recent failures on {{ImportTest}}, but not this one. So yes, I think we can close this ticket as "can't repro".
