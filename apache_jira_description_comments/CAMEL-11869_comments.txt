    I've moved forward all components but not camel-core yet as its build seems to be broken.

    CAMEL-11869: Adopted mockito-core 2.10.0 except for camel-core

----


I had to ignore the DefaultManagementAgentMockTest as its flaky/fails when you run a full test of camel-core, eg with mvn clean install
I assume if we migrate to mockito v2 this can be improved.

The DefaultManagementAgentMockTest has been fixed in [https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/1997]

All projects dependencies have been aligned to mockito 2.11.0 bringing in some improvements:
* A lot of useless mocking statements have been deleted
* Few flaky tests were corrected
* Unnecessary dependencies were removed
* Unnecessary dependency exclusions were avoided
* Generics related improvements, more issues detected at compile time
* Few mocks reset were avoided (few remain)
* And this is not a general rule, but some tests are even going something like 3 times faster

Enjoy.

[~aldettinger] Awesome, thank you for your hard work!

Great, thank you very much!
