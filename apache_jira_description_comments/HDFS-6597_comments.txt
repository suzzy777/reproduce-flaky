Patch for this change

Concept seems reasonable, but I don't think "force" is a good name for this.  We are not "forcing" anything.

A couple of alternative ideas on naming:
* -upgrade -halt
* -upgradeOnly
* -upgradeNoStartup

I like any of those, and I'm open to other suggestions too.  I agree that "force" doesn't exactly fit, because that would imply forcing something to complete despite warnings.

The idea seems to be good as it does not alter the way -upgrade currently works.
* I agree with [~cmccabe] and [~cnauroth] on the new name to be "force"
* Instead of -force, -halt or -upgradeOnly seems to be reasonable. But anything would be good as long as it does nor imply we are forcing something to get done which it should not be doing.

Thanks,
Mit

Changing the summary to describe the jira more accurately.

bq. and later when all services were started, upgrade of datanodes finished sucessfully and system run

Here is NN still included in "all services"? If it's not, how will upgrade of datanodes be handled?

Hi guys,
You have point when saying -force is not right name. I would pick -upgradeOnly as maybe best option. What is your opinion?
[~jingzhao]
Yes, NN is included in all services. Datanodes need it up to upgrade itself.

Thanks,
Danilo

Hi,

I've attached patch proposal. Please take a look.

Thanks,
Danilo

The new patch proposal for naming the option "-upgradeOnly" looks good to me.  I'd say it would be good to go ahead with full implementation using that naming.  Thanks, [~dvunjak]!

Hi, [~dvunjak].  This mostly looks good.  I have 2 comments:
# I built the distro after adding a bogus new feature to bump the version to -58 in {{NameNodeLayoutVersion}}.  I tried running -upgradeOnly, but it didn't actually upgrade the metadata files.  It looks like you'll need another change in {{FSImage#recoverTransitionRead}}.  There is a switch statement that looks for the {{UPGRADE}} option, but not the new {{UPGRADEONLY}} option.
# The new test suite is a copy of the existing {{TestStartupOptionUpgrade}} with the option changed to {{UPGRADEONLY}}.  Instead of cloning the code, this looks like a good opportunity for a JUnit {{Parameterized}} test.  See {{TestNameNodeHttpServer}} for an existing example of a {{Parameterized}} test.  I think you can make a fairly small change in the existing {{TestStartupOptionUpgrade}} so that it's parameterized to run on both options: {{UPGRADE}} and {{UPGRADEONLY}}.

Hi [~cnauroth],

I did changes as you suggest.

Thanks, Danilo.  This is looking good.  Just 2 more comments:
# In {{TestStartupOptionUpgrade}}, please remove the unused import of {{HttpConfig}}.
# Also in the test, the {{setUp}} method still sets {{startOpt}} to {{UPGRADE}} before each test runs.  I think you'll need to remove that line.

I'm not sure why are failing those 2 tests:

org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.tools.TestDFSAdminWithHA
org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.TestProcessCorruptBlocks

They doesn't fail when I run them as unit tests on my machine.

Thanks,
Danilo

+1 for the patch.  Thanks for incorporating all of the feedback, Danilo.  I'll commit this.

bq. -1 core tests. The patch failed these unit tests in hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs:

We've had some trouble with these tests being flaky lately.  The failure is unrelated to this patch.

I committed this to trunk and branch-2.  Danilo, thank you for contributing this patch.
