hachikuji commented on pull request #6070: KAFKA-7773; Add end to end system test relying on verifiable consumer
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6070
 
 
   This patch creates an `EndToEndTest` base class which relies on the verifiable consumer. This will ultimately replace `PlaintextConsumerTest` which depends on the console consumer. The advantage is that we can the verifiable consumer exposes more information that can be used for validation. It also allows for a nicer shutdown pattern. Rather than relying on the console consumer idle timeout, which requires a minimum wait time, we can halt consumption after we have reached the last acked offsets. This should be more reliable and faster. The downside is that the verifiable consumer only works with the new consumer, so we cannot yet convert the upgrade tests.  In this patch, I've converted only the replication tests and a flaky security test to use `EndToEndTest`.
