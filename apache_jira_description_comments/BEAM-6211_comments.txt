Hey [~altay], would you mind updating the assignee to me?

The PR is passing the checks and is ready for review.

[~altay], would you mind helping to shepard this to the correct reviewer? It looks like [~dhalperi@google.com] was reviewer on adding deflate support to the Java SDK but that was almost two years ago.

 

[~brianmartin] added [~chamikara] as a review to the PR. Please work with him.
