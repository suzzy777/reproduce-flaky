Cassandra's build.xml supports parallel test runners. This functionality is available through {{`-Dtest.runners`}} and the {{`testparallel`}} ant macro.

Having not been actively used and atrophied over time, it breaks a number of tests. The distributed in-jvm tests don't work at all with parallel runners (currently they need `-Dtest.runners=1` specified to work). And there are plenty of flakies, from where
tests use fixed ports (StorageServiceServerTest), to byteman (eg BMUnitRunner), and around conf files on disk.

This was raised on the dev ML, where the consensus was to remove it: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r1ca3c72b90fa6c57c1cb7dcd02a44221dcca991fe7392abd8c29fe95%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E

The idea is to then replace ant test parallelism with docker container parallelism.
