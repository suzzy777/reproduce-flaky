Unfortunately I lost the detailed error message from the Jenkins build, but the failure had to do with parsing timestamp strings.  I believe the test is using the current time (not a fixed value) and therefore the test has a dependency on WHEN it is ran.  I think the issue is when the time of the run is prior to 12PM... example: 2021-07-29T07:32:43

Needs more investigation.
