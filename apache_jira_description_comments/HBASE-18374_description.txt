At the RS level we have latency metrics for mutate/puts and deletes that are updated per batch (ie. at the end of entire batchop if it contains put/delete update the respective metric) in contrast with append/increment/get metrics that are updated per op. This is a bit ambiguous since the delete and put metrics are updated for multi row mutations that happen to contain a put/delete. We should rename the metric(eg. delete_batch)/add better description. Also we should add metrics for single delete client operations that come through RSRpcServer.mutate path. We should also add metrics for checkAndPut and checkAndDelete.
