Some tests in hbase-server module are flaky.
Currently tests in subsequent modules such as hbase-shell may be skipped if one or more tests from hbase-server module fail.

Chatting with Anoop, we think for JIRAs whose patch has incompatible change, it is important to detect failed test(s) in all modules.

We can apply '--fail-at-end' option in runTests() method of test-patch.sh
