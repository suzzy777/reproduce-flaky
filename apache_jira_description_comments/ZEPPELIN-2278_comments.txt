    [ZEPPELIN-2278] Env variable to configure Npm registry

    ### What is this PR for?
    When deploying Zeppelin in private Cloud or within closed networks, it happens that Npm Registry isn't directly reachable, so we want to configure our own proxy/registry otherwise we couldn't fetch dependencies. It is anyhow worth to let user configure npm registry instead of hardcoding the URL.
    
    
    ### What type of PR is it?

    ### What is the Jira issue?

    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update?
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions?
    * Does this needs documentation?

    Hi @andreaTP. Thanks for contribution.
    
    - Zeppelin build system relies on travis. So please setup your travis account and travis project for Zeppelin. 
    - https://zeppelin.apache.org/contribution/contributions.html#continuous-integration
    - The repository name must be `zeppelin` (not `incubator-zeppelin`, ...)
    - It's not mandatory to pass all tests to be reviewed. But some reviewers might select passed PRs first

    Thanks for the feedback @1ambda , travis should be configured properly now, I will try to dig into but it looks tests spuriously fail, anyhow any help on getting the right direction is highly appreciated! 


Github user 1ambda commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2150
  
    It might be due to flaky tests. If so, please just restart failed jobs.  
    I'v just looked your travis build and it's ok 
    
    - https://travis-ci.org/andreaTP/zeppelin/builds/212066501
    
    After CI is green, please close and re-open this PR. Then jenkins will update status.

    probably you have a problem on Jenkins, Travis is currently building without errors:
    https://travis-ci.org/nokia/zeppelin
    
    still this PR is marked as Failed...


Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2150
  
    @andreaTP 
    
    Problem on CI just has fixed on master branch. 
    Could you try rebase or merge master branch and see if CI passes?


Github user andreaTP commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2150
  
    @Leemoonsoo
    rebased.
    Unfortunately again failures on CI, this is on Jenkins side I guess https://builds.apache.org/job/zeppelin-pull-request/580/console
    this is spurious since travis job is correctly started.
    
    I go closing and re-opening the PR to trigger again the build (seemed to work last time)

    Looks like Jenkins build script still does not handle contribution from organization repository very well.
    Let me try fix this.


Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    I updated Jenkins build command. @andreaTP can you close / reopen this PR? Jenkins now will check https://travis-ci.org/nokia/zeppelin/builds/213131116 correctly.
