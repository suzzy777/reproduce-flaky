When changing replication factor for a given file, the following 3 types of logging appear in the namenode log, but more detailed message would be useful especially when the file is in snapshot(s).
{noformat}
Decreasing replication from X to Y for FILE
Increasing replication from X to Y for FILE
Replication remains unchanged at X for FILE
{noformat}
I have added additional log messages as well as further test scenarios to org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.snapshot.TestSnapshotReplication#testReplicationWithSnapshot.

The test sequence is:

1) A file is created with replication factor 1 (there are 5 datanodes)

2) Take a snapshot and increase the factor by 1. Continue this loop up to 5.

3) Setrep back to 3, but the target replication is decided to 4, which is the maximum in snapshots.

{noformat}
4) Setrep to 3 again, but it's unchanged as follows. Both 3) and 4) are expected.

{noformat}
5) Make sure the number of replicas in datanodes remains 4.
