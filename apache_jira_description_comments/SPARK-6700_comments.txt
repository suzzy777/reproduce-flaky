Does this fail often?  How often?  Might the issue be related to SPARK-6506?

i do not think this is related to SPARK-6506 because YarnClusterSuite setted SPARK_HOME. Just now i run YarnClusterSuite test,but i got python application test in YarnClusterSuite is successfully.[~davies] can you report your unit-test.log or appMaster.log? in addition, i think you can try again because there maybe has other errors to cause it failed. 

There is one failure here: https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/Spark-Master-SBT/2036/AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE=hadoop2.3,label=centos/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn/YarnClusterSuite/run_Python_application_in_yarn_cluster_mode/

and here: 
https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/Spark-Master-SBT/2025/AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE=hadoop2.3,label=centos/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn/YarnClusterSuite/run_Python_application_in_yarn_cluster_mode/

Is it related to hadoop2.3 ?

i had used hadoop2.3.0 to test and that is ok. Can you report spark/yarn/target/unit-test.log? i think that has more information about failure.
