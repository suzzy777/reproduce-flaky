This is an IWYU analysis. If the module is using its transitive deps without depending on them, or if it has direct dependencies it doesn't use, the build fails. The work involves adding dependencies or adding exclusion rules (example: https://github.com/wfhartford/gradle-dependency-analyze#configurations). Even if they just add exclusions across the board, it will be a big win because it will prevent new violations.
