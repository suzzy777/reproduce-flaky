{{TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver[vector_if_expr]}} test is flaky reported in HIVE-15776. Looking into TestCliDriver[alter1]

Fixed the test failure. Also, added a couple of tests in TestJdbcDriver2 to cover {{show tables in <dbname>}} command

Tests seem unrelated. They are working for me locally. Another pre-commit job run immediately after this job had TestSparkCliDriver failures too https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/4138/

Reattaching the same patch to make sure.

Test failures are flaky and have been reported in HIVE-15165 and HIVE-15289. I see a similar exception trace in the logs above. [~ashutoshc] [~thejas] Can you please review?

[~spena] Can you please review? Thanks!

The patch looks good [~vihangk1].
+1

I just wonder how getTableMeta is tested. Is {{show tables in DB}} the statement that calls it?

Thanks for the review [~spena] getTableMeta is called from the GetTablesOperations() which is called from the JDBC API {{HiveDatabaseMeta.getTables()}} method. Test coverage for this API is already present in TestJdbcDriver2 test case.

Committed to master.
Thanks [~vihangk1] for your contribution.
