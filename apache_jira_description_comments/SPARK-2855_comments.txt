[~zhunansjtu] the link you supplied no longer works, please include the test failure in a comment on this jira

I guess they have fixed this.....Jenkins side mistake?

[~joshrosen]?

Do you recall the actual exception?  Was it a Py4J error (something like "connection to GatewayServer failed?").  It seems like we've been experiencing some flakiness in these tests and I wonder whether it's due to some system resource being exhausted, such as ephemeral ports.

no....

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313

search "This particular failure was my fault,"

That issue should be fixed now, so I'm going to mark this JIRA as resolved.  Feel free to re-open (or open a new issue) if you notice flaky PySpark tests.
