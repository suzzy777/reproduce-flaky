See HBASE-18105 for related information,  this jira will change the logic of Path 1 in splitProcedure, the execution path will be:
*HBaseAdmin.splitRegionAsync -> MasterKeepAliveConnection.splitRegion  ->  MasterRpcServices.splitRegion  ->  HMaster.splitRegion-> AssignmentManager.submitProcedure*

Master Will no longer ask Rs and then Rs turn around to ask master to do the split operation.
