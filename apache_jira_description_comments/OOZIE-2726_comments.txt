[~satishsaley] the breaking tests seem relevant to your changes. Please fix them.

[~satishsaley] Can you please take a look into failed test cases? This is marked for {{4.3.0}} release. Thanks.

1. TestCoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand.testMaterizationLookup

If start is in Daylight savings time (e.g. PDT) and end is in Standard time (e.g. PST), then we need to add DST_OFFSET to end.
If start is in Standard time (e.g. PST) and end is in Daylight savings time (e.g. PDT), then we need to subtract DST_OFFSET from end.


In this test case, coord job start time is in Daylight time and end time is in Standard Time. Therefore, we should be adding DST_OFFSET to end. We don't have daylight adjustments while materializing the actions. In the following loop, we increment {{effStart}} which is in Daylight time and compared it with {{end}} which is in Standard Time. This results in materialization of one less action. 

{code}
https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/command/coord/CoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand.java#L458
while (effStart.compareTo(end) < 0 && (ignoreMaxActions || maxActionToBeCreated-- > 0)) {
            if (pause != null && effStart.compareTo(pause) >= 0) {
                break;
            }
...
...
                effStart.add(freqTU.getCalendarUnit(), lastActionNumber * Integer.parseInt(coordJob.getFrequency()));

{code}

The same thing happens when start is in Standard time and end is in Daylight savings time. But there we get one extra materialized action.


2. TestCoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand.testActionMaterWithDST1 and TestCoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand.testActionMaterWithDST2

Basically, these tests conflict with the above fix. i.e. if we fix above these will break and if we fix these then above will break on each Daylight saving time. 

For {{testActionMaterWithDST1}}, start time is in Standard Time {{2013-03-10T08:00Z}} and end time is in Daylight savings time {{2013-03-10T12:00Z}}. For an hourly cron freqency job, we expect it to materialize 4 actions. But, after considering time adjustments (i.e. subtracing DST_OFFSET from end), its only 3 actions. 

For {{testActionMaterWithDST2}}, it the reverse, instead of 4, there will be 5 actions to materialize.



Changing the dates used in newly added test cases so that anyone can test this patch locally by setting system date to daylight saving dates from 2016.

After discussion with Rohini, I changed the patch to modify the testcases only. Earlier I had changes in {{CoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand}} which changed the behavior of materialization. 

It is only test case that needs change. Pushing it to 5.0 as test is only flaky for 3 days around the DST change (new Date() + 3 days in testcase) .
