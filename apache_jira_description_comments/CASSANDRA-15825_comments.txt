I noticed commenting out the other test in that class made this one fail consistently. So there seems to be cross talk between test cases. It seems that on the 4th sstable a compaction is triggered and that can remove the sstables under our feet depending on who is faster. The fix I applied is to prevent the compaction from running. I hope it makes sense. Waiting on CI now.
