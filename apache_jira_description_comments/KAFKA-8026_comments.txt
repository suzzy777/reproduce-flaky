[~bbejeck] I think you cherry-picked the PR to old branches as well, maybe it was just before the commit? Worth checking the jenkins console (it shows upon which commit githash it was triggered).

Failed again: [https://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/kafka-1.1-jdk7/detail/kafka-1.1-jdk7/250/tests]

Seems something is broken on 1.1 branch.

Seems to fail consistently in `1.1` [https://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/kafka-1.1-jdk7/detail/kafka-1.1-jdk7/251/tests]

Failed again in `1.1` [https://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/kafka-1.1-jdk7/detail/kafka-1.1-jdk7/252/tests]

URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6459
 
 
   This PR is an attempt to fix the `RegexSourceIntegrationTest` flakiness
   
   1. Delete and create all topics before each test starts.
   2. Give the streams application in each test a unique application ID
   3. Create a `KafkaStreams` instance local to each test.
   
   I ran the entire suite of streams tests.

bbejeck commented on pull request #6463: KAFKA-8026: Fix flaky regex source integration test 1.0
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6463
 
 
   This PR is an attempt to fix the RegexSourceIntegrationTest flakiness. My investigation did not reveal any issues, and I was unable to reproduce the failure locally. So I've taken some steps to eliminate what I think could be a race condition in the test.
   
   This is a mirror image of #6459 and is the fix for `1.0`
   
   1. Delete and create all topics before each test starts.
   2. Give the streams application in each test a unique application ID
   3.  Create a KafkaStreams instance local to each test.

   This is a 2.3-idiomatic recreation of Bill Bejeck
   <bbejeck@gmail.com>'s [original patch](https://github.com/nexiahome/kafka/commit/92c591d) for the 1.1 branch, that seems to have been inadvertently omitted. I'm not sure if this PR ought to be against the 2.3 branch, or trunk; it should apply cleanly to either.
   
   *More detailed description of your change,

   comment to ping reviewers.*
   
   *Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)
   for the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration
   tests are expected for any behaviour change and
   system tests should be considered for larger changes.*
