HI [~yufeigu],

Thanks for the patch. It looks good, only a few nits/suggestions:
* change DEFAULT_TOP_LINE_NUM to DEFAULT_TOP_NUM_FAILED_TESTS (imagine we may report multiple lines for one test in the future)
* change num_line to num_failed_tests
* change error_num to error_count (not to confuse with errno)
* About "Among x runs examined, top y failed tests ...". The y here need to consider the case that when y is bigger than total number of failed tests. Suggest to change to "Among x runs examined, y tests failed, and the top z failed tests are (<#failedRuns: testName>):", where y is the total number of failed tests, and make the z here MIN(z, y).
* In non-summary mode, modify the report to "Among x runs examined,  all y failed tests are (<#failedRuns: testName>):
*
{code}
logging.info("\n" + str(error_num) + " errors found, check error details with non summary mode."
{code}
Change to 
{code}
logging.info("\n" + str(error_num) + " errors found,  you may re-run in non summary mode to see error details."
{code}

Thanks.




Hi Yongjun,

Thanks for the detailed review and all these good suggestion. I will add a new patch after modification.

Hi Yongjun,

About the "Among x runs examined, top y failed tests ...", it might be better if the program print out "all failed tests ..." if the y is bigger than the total number of failed tests. I've made these changes. Check the HADOOP-11965.002.patch for details.

Hi [~yufeigu],

I noticed some lines involved in the change exceeded 80 chars per line, would you please create a new rev with this fixed?

Thanks and sorry for not pointing this out earlier.
