[~spena], can you review the patch? This should fix the remaining q test fails; I think there are no major issues, some stats changes, one case not covered by null stats optimizer that is covered in follow-up version, and vectorization disabled for IN clause with decimals (expected).

With this one in, we are almost ready to create the first RC.

LGTM +1

I deleted the HiveQA comment in order to retrigger the Jenkins job (manually from Jenkins). 
Now that HIVE-15094 is resolved, we should see less test failures.

[~jcamachorodriguez] I had some free time today, and I updated all of the test failures shown on the last HiveQA. Hope you don't mind.

Np, and changes look good. +1

[~jcamachorodriguez] I committed this to the branch-2.1. The rest of the qtest failures seem flaky.

We could try to fix the other tests in a different jira, or find a jira on 2.2 that fixes them.

Awesome, great work, thanks!

Indeed, I think we are almost ready to go and create the first RC.

[~jcamachorodriguez] Cool, the tests failing do not seem critical. I will continue investigating those failures in the mean time.
Let me know if you need some help on creating the RC.

[~spena], thanks for offering your help! This week I'm in ApacheCon Big Data, so I do not think I will have time to push the RC for the bug-fix release. If you would like to have the release before then, please go ahead, I think there is no constraint for creating a bug fix release even if you were not the RM for the minor revision. Otherwise, I will try to push it myself as soon as I have some cycles.

[~jcamachorodriguez] I did not have time last week to do the RC, but if you're still busy, then I can do it this week. 

[~spena], I have seen that you have been cleaning up issues whose target was 2.1.1; thanks a lot for all the effort. I am back and can spin a RC this week (even today). Is there any issue that you think that should still go into 2.1.1 and is blocking us? I took a quick look and I did not see any blocker...

[~jcamachorodriguez]. There was a license header issue that I just committed on HIVE-15248. Also, there are 3 bugs marked as critical and targeted to 2.1.1 (HIVE-14430 HIVE-13943 HIVE-13484). I left a comment on them to ask if they are still valid. Besides those, I changed the target for the rest of the non-blockers issues.
