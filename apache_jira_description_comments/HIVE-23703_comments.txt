Thanks a lot [~klcopp] for the patch!

Pushed to master. Thanks [~kuczoram], [~pvary] and [~dkuzmenko] for reviewing!

[~klcopp] looks like one of the new test is flaky:
[http://ci.hive.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/hive-precommit/detail/PR-1143/6/tests]

[~pvargacl]: Could you please check with the flaky test jenkins: http://ci.hive.apache.org/job/hive-flaky-check/55/
If it is flaky, then we should disable it until it is fixed.

Thanks,
Peter

I have run the jenkins job with one test case and the whole test class, both of them passed, so it must have been some intermittent issue.

Ok, thanks for checking [~pvargacl]!
