Can you link the Jira which broke this, add the root cause and loop in the folks involved in that Jira.

Thanks for the suggestion, I have linked jira.

this reordering is breaking some yetus runs, implying the output ordering is brittle. 

# Created HDFS-16934
# proposed: use assertJ to assert on the exact contents of the log *in any order*. 

[~slfan1989] you wan't to take that up?

[~stevel@apache.org] I will follow up this Jira HDFS-16934
