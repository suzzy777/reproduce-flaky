This is making the manual commit tests flaky. There's lots of messages like this in the test logs: 

 

2021-11-29 11:28:47,173 [umer[test-full]] INFO  KafkaFetchRecords              - Auto commitSync on stop test-full-Thread 0 from topic test-full
2021-11-29 11:28:47,173 [umer[test-full]] INFO  KafkaFetchRecords              - Auto commitSync on stop test-full-Thread 0 from topic test-full

 

This is likely wrong in this context (probably introduced by CAMEL-17096).
