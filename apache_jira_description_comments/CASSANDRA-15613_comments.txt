There are two problem with this test.  First, 3 seconds may not be long enough to see the bootstrapping node.  Second, it assumes that after inserting 10k rows, the node will still be bootstrapping, and there's simply no logical guarantee that will be the case.  The simplest thing to do, since we don't actually care if the node ever finishes joining, is to put it into write survey mode so it will perpetually be joining. Patch to increase the initial sleep slightly and use survey mode here: https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/tree/CASSANDRA-15613

LGTM +1

Thanks, committed.
