Several problems:
# The job failed, but there's no message at the end of the console out explaining why
# The summary page in Jenkins shows that all tests pass -- no failures.  It's a known issue that the junit plugin is not finding all the test results (it caps at 999), so potentially this is caused by that
# The run test scripts don't log clearly so it's hard to figure out if a failure is caused by a test failure or a jenkins script failure.  For example, bin/run-all-tests.sh with set TEST_RET_CODE to 1 for failures of scripts, but these scripts aren't traced, there's no echo of found issues, and there's no summary at the end. So, if it is a failure, there's no way to separate that failure from some other jenkins script failure causing the job failure.
# Linking to IMPALA-1255: run-tests.py should give a results summary which will help
