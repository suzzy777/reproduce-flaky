Created a patch based off master to use HBase's MultiTableInputFormat.  I need to add more tests for the new functionality (getting flaky builds locally).

Also I think we might have potential for another enhancement to make a MultiTableHBaseSourceTarget that instead of being scoped towards a single table could support multiple using the MultiTableInputFormat and MultiTableOutputFormat.

Code looks good-- is this only for a specific version of HBase, or can it go into 0.8.x and 0.10.x?

It was added to the 0.96 (and higher) as well as the 0.94.x code stream for HBase but it might require me to upgrade from 0.8's current 0.94.3 version.  Would that be an issue?  Looks like 0.94.5 would be the minimum[1] however I believe they are up to 0.94.15 as far as fix versions.  I was hoping to get it into both code streams.

Nah, I think a version update to HBase in the 0.8 branch is overdue; I don't think anyone is running against lower versions anymore.

@Micah this looks good to me-- anything else you want to do with it?

Nope your validation is all I need.  :)  I want to write more tests and apply it to the 0.8 branch as well.  I'm trying to get CRUNCH-272 landed and then I'll get back to fixing this one up.

Patch for master that should build successfully and modified the tests slightly to use multiple scans.

A follow up patch for the 0.8 branch will be coming (should only include an HBase dependency change)

Patch for the 0.8 code stream.  A few more changes than just POM but nothing major.

Awesome.  Changes have been pushed to master and the 0.8 code stream.

0.8.3/0.10.0 release issue closing.
