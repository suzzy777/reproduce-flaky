This can occur with more realistic frequencies when a coordinator is resubmitted - e.g. after disaster recovery - without changing the start time - as the execution is LAST_ONLY, why should we care about the start time?

[~gezapeti] indeed, the only criteria being:
* {{execution=LAST_ONLY}} or {{execution=NONE}}
* current materialization end time lies in the past

So no reference to {{start}} or {{end}} here.

Clearing the {{insertList}} after a processed batch decrease the memory consumption, but if we don't commit till the very end then we could still get OOM error.

This WIP patch tries to solve it by introducing a new parameter {{oozie.service.CoordMaterializeTriggerService.action.batch.size}} and committing after the batches.

There are a few questions:

* What is the optimum value for the {{batch.size}}. Right now I entered 1000, but it's probably too low.
* This approach still wants to materialize all the coordinator actions in a single {{CoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand}}. If we want to materialize a huge number, it might still take quite a long time with a huge number of DB operations. Even if we don't get OOM it might be better to materialize only a limited number and continue in the next step. It would take longer to reach the current time, but during that period the server would not be stressed.

[~zuston] Oozie does not support pull requests, so I prefer not to upload there (we should turn it off till we support it). We were usually using [https://reviews.apache.org/] do you have an account there? I'm happy to upload the patch there.

To be honest, I just use a Git Patch Viewer browser extension which makes patch files much more readable.

Meanwhile I have reviewed and tested the current approach ( [^OOZIE-3254-01-wip.patch] ), however I have still experienced OOM unfortunately.

The mentioned {{CoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand#{*}insertList{*}}} indeed got cleared, but the {{org.apache.oozie.command.coord.CoordActionNotificationXCommand}} and {{org.apache.oozie.command.coord.CoordActionInputCheckXCommand}} commands invoked inside {{org.apache.oozie.command.coord.CoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand}} made the memory full.

Currently I am working on a fix, which bypasses this by refactoring {{CoordMaterializeTransitionXCommand}} in case LAST_ONLY or NONE coordinator execution type to only materialize a certain amount of actions.

Thanks for testing my patch [~jmakai] , I don't really remember if I tested it on a real cluster. I'm sad to hear that it's not working, but waiting for your patch.

Thank you [~jmakai] for your change. I checked it and it looks good to me. [~asalamon74] let me know if you have any concerns.

Thanks

[~jmakai] [~dionusos] Sorry for the slow response. The change looks good to me. If it was tested with the same config where the original code and my partial fix gave OOM and this one works, then we are good to go.

[~asalamon74] [~dionusos]  I confirm this code change fixes the OOM and works as expected.

OOZIE-3254 [coordinator] LAST_ONLY and NONE execution modes: possible OutOfMemoryError when there are too many coordinator actions to materialize (jmakai via dionusos)


Thank you [~jmakai] for your contribution. The change is merged to master.

Many thanks [~dionusos] :)
