Caused by: ERROR XBM0A: The database directory '/home/jenkins/workspace/SparkPullRequestBuilder@4/target/tmp/spark-84c8ff0e-214f-416c-9d44-ab19f864a79b' exists. However, it does not contain the expected 'service.properties' file. Perhaps Derby was brought down in the middle of creating this database. You may want to delete this directory and try creating the database again.
