Nice catch [~zuston]. It seems to me your solution will call {{copyActionData}} even if we never go to {{else}}. I'm not sure if it's a problem, it would be good to test it.

If at least one action is not deleted when reruning, the call function is required, and it needs to be called only once. So no need to call repeatedly. Do you think so?

[~zuston]Â I agree with that part it's a good improvement.

What happens if we delete all the actions? In the original code, this method was called 0 times, in your code it is called 1 time. It would be good to test this.

[~asalamon74]. I uploaded the latest patch to keep the logic consistent with the original code, although I think the method of \{{copyActionData}} is harmless.
