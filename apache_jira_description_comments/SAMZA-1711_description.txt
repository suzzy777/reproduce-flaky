*Changes:*
 * Enable all existing standalone integration tests except `TestZkStreamProcessorSession`(`TestZkStreamProcessorSession` is flaky. It spawns `x` StreamProcessors. It kills one StreamProcessor through zookeeper session expiration. Sleeps for 5 seconds and proceeds to do validation. If the rebalancing phase takes longer the sleep time, validation fails).
 * Remove zookeeper unavailable unit test from LocalApplicationRunner(Race condition in zookeeper shutdown fails other tests). The deleted test will be added back in a separate test class.
 * Increase zookeeper server minimum session timeout from 6 seconds to 120 seconds.
 * Add assertions to validate if kafka topics setup were successful before the unit tests.
