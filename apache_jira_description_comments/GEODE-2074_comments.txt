GEODE-2074 GMSJoinLeaveJUnitTest.testDuplicateJoinRequestDoesNotCauseNewView

I've run this test class hundreds of times with only one failure in
a different test.  I've also run the individual test many hundreds of times
with no failures.  Since the ticket didn't include any of the test
output or any information about past tests run that could have affected
this test I am closing the ticket and modifying the test's failure
text to give more information about the state of the Join/Leave processor
if the test should fail again.

This commit also includes a fix for the other test method that failed.
