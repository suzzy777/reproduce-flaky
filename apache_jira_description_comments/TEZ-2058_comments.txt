[~sseth] [~bikassaha] review please?

Change looks fine. Why do we not hit this in other tests? Because submission does not fail for them?

[~bikassaha] Yes - these tests explicitly force app submission to fail by specifying an invalid queue name. 

Thanks for the review [~bikassaha]. Committed to branches 0.5 and 0.6 in addition to master. 

Closing issue as 0.5.4, 0.6.1 and 0.7.0 have been released.
