I've seen an intermittent test failure that looks like this:

{{Failed tests:}}
{{  TestSpecificLogicalTypes.testAbilityToReadJsr310RecordWrittenAsJodaRecord:148}}
{{Expected: is "20:35:18.720"}}
{{     but: was "20:35:18.72"}}

When I see this failure, it's always the case that the trailing digit is zero.  I suspect that it's a bug where the trailing zero is not printed.  Since the test cases use the current time, then most of the time the trailing digit isn't zero and the bug isn't tickled.  But once-in-a-while the current time has a trailing zero, which tickles the bug.

If this diagnosis is correct, then in addition to fixing the bug, it might be a good idea to add tests with hard-wired, static times that cover corner cases like this one.
