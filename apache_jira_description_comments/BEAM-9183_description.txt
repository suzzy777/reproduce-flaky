The test appears to fail in -pytest environments on precommits on several PRs:

https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Phrase/1402
https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Phrase/1397/
https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Phrase/1405

I was not able to reproduce it locally via: 
- python ./setup.py test -s apache_beam.options.pipeline_options_test
- tox -e py27-cython-pytest
 - pytest apache_beam/options/pipeline_options_test.py

Not sure what's happening.
