From private discussions I discovered that running {{npm audit}} on a number of components would report dependencies with security issues. While we could not see any {{npm audit}} issues that may affect applications built using Cordova I think it is extremely important to resolve these issues as soon as possible. Most affect devDependencies used for testing of Cordova itself; a minority seem to affect Cordova scripts that may be run by Cordova application developers. Better safe than sorry!

I would like to resolve this issue as follows:
* patch release of common library components such as {{cordova-common}}, -{{cordova-lib}}, etc.- (fixed in minor release branch) _- solution for other components to be tracked on GitHub, moved out of the scope of this issue_
* patch or minor release of -other affected components such as CLI,- Cordova platform implementations, -major plugins, etc.- (expected to be fixed in minor release branch; do not want to pollute the master branch with extra reverts, updated node_modules committed, etc.) _- solution for other components to be tracked on GitHub, moved out of the scope of this issue_
* -{{npm audit}} issues resolved in master branch for next major release, which should NOT be shipped with any {{npm audit}} issues lurking- _- to be tracked on GitHub, as part of general update of dependencies, moved out of the scope of this issue_
* -{{npm audit}} step added to CI for both patch release and next major release- _(not wanted)_
