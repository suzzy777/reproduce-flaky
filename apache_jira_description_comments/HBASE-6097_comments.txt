The issue is that this test checks that a sync happened like so:
{code}
assertEquals(1, HLog.getSyncOps());
{code}

But in 0.92, the LogSyncer thread will sync, and increment HLog.getSyncOps(), even if there are no updates to the wal.  This has been fixed in 0.94+.

So, you can trigger a failure by setting hbase.regionserver.optionallogflushinterval to an extremely low value and throwing in random sleeps to the test.

Possibilities for fixing:
1) Backport the work from 0.94+ that avoids syncing if there are no updates to the wal
2) Only change the test and just check that a sync ran, e.g.
{code}
assert(HLog.getSyncOps() > 0);
{code}
This makes the test a bit too accepting, because then it is possible that the syncer can sync nothing and we'd think a sync actually ran.

I'll investigate some more.

* Attached HBASE-6097.patch *

Fixes race by setting the timeout of the LogSyncerThread to a very high value so it won't affect the number of sync ops.

I think backporting work from 0.94+ would be better.

@Ted:

I considered that but these backports are tricky HLog-performance/bug fixes that are 0.94 specific.  We would need at least HBASE-4487 and HBASE-5782, and possibly many more.

I thought it makes more sense to have that stuff live only in 0.94+ and to make the minimal change for the flaky test.

Changes in HLog from HBASE-4487 are relatively big.
It is fine to fix test first.

+1 on minimal fix for an old branch rather than pull in a bunch of new code.

Thanks for the patch Gregory.
