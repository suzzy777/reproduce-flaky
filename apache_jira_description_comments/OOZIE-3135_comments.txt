This is exactly what we have to do for Hive as well. They also switched to log4j2 and we have to detect whether it's log4j or log4j2. 

[~pbacsko] we have an issue for HiveMain as well: OOZIE-3137

Ya, I missed that. I thought we haven't filed a JIRA for that yet.

Unfortunately Sqoop is using log4j1, so if we configure Log4j2, we will loose the Sqoop logs.

We need to check if only the tests are affected or real action is affected as well.

If only the tests are affected, we need to find another approach for fixing them.
