I reproduced the failure locally. Attaching the log.

The NPE occurs because {{tmpOivImgDir}} is not initialized. I attached a simple patch to initialize {{tmpOivImgDir}} and configure the directory to output a legacy fsimage.

These test failures look unrelated to the patch. I cannot reproduce them.

Hi [~ajisakaa], 

Thanks for finding and fixing the issue. The latest patch (.2 version) looks good to me. +1. 

BTW, The test failures appears to be not related to the change here, I'd suggest we file JIRAs for both issues (after this patch is committed), which might help us to to identify the source of the flakiness.
