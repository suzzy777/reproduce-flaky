this is basically blocking CASSANDRA-18935 because by TCM being merged it changed the trunk so reverting stuff in CASSANDRA-18935 would not apply for trunk anymore.

[~samt]  [~ifesdjeen]  [~marcuse] I would love to get some feedback and review here! Not sure who was dealing with that part of the code as it was squashed and committed by Sam.

I made the in-jvm dtest stable and not flaky but I have broken test_counter_leader_with_partial_view in Python dtests. We might rewrite it to in-jvm dtest instead as I find the debugging in Python one rather cumbersome.
