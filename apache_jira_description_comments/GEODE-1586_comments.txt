    GEODE-1586: Re-arranged the validation sequence in the test case.

    	* Validate that the receiver region side before validating that the sender's queues are drained.
    	* This gives the sender's queues additional time to drain.
    	* size() in CustomEntryConcurrentHashMap is written such that if the counts do not change in two iterations, that value is returned as size.
    	* This size() will not be always consistent.
    	* Only the test can be modified to ensure that the queues get enough time to drain out.
