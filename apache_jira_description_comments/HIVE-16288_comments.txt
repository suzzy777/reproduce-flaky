comments.q failure can't possibly be related to this patch.

[~spena] [~stakiar] [~juanrh] can you take a look? Do we still have a "flaky tests" umbrella Jira?

Added reviewboard submission

Will take a look - the flaky test JIRA for comments.q is HIVE-16256

LGTM, +1 (non-binding)

+1

Pushed to master. Thanks, Thomas!

Hey [~ashutoshc], also looking to have this backported to branch-2. You want a second Jira for that? It should apply cleanly -- I don't think master and branch-2 have diverged enough yet.

Pushed  to branch-2 as well.

Thanks!

I think these tests were added to the wrong directory (should be under itest/hive-blobstore instead of hive-blobstore).
https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/ea41d0a685fb346ce20075d0dcc3c736e375bb20

Seems the events.txt also goes to the wrong location.

hey [~ashutoshc], it looks like the patch may have applied incorrectly, can you take a look for us?

Fixed.

I hate to bump this again, but it looks like branch-2 is still wrong. Can you help again, [~ashutoshc]? Thank you!

Fixed.

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
