Add it to finally block ?
{code}
finally {
 try {
 rawStore.shutdown();
 } catch (Exception e){ 
   LOG.error("Error shutting down RawStore",e );
 }
}
{code}

Sounds good. Attach HIVE-16779.2.patch.

minor nit : LOG.error("Error shutting down RawStore",e ); can you add a space before "e" and remove space after e :)

Can you please verify if partition_column_names_with_leading_and_trailing_spaces failure is related to this ? (maybe a local run to validate)


Verified that the partition_column_names_with_leading_and_trailing_spaces failure is not seen locally. Looks like a rare flaky test.
Committing soon.

Patch committed to master.
Thanks Daniel!


Typo in the commit:  "achedStore leak PersistenceManager resources" -- see commit bbf0629a5a2e43531c4fd5e17d727497e89d267d.

Does this need an update in errata.txt?

bq. Does this need an update in errata.txt?
I think it will be fine as jira number is accurate.
Thanks for pointing that out.


Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
