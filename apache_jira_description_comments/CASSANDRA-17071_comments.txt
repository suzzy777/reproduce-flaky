+1. Extra credit for an awesome fuzz test!

Committed to trunk with [cede538e029e14dc6298025794c72cc100118953|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/cede538e029e14dc6298025794c72cc100118953].

This patch seems to make \{{KeyspaceMetricsTest.testMetricsCleanupOnDrop}}, as reported by CASSANDRA-17658. That test verifies that the metrics of a keyspace are dropped after dropping the keyspace. However, in some runs the metrics are still there after dropping. The test used to pass right before committing this ([j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1611/workflows/e2fe5f89-2ec9-4897-8f9a-07f467a874be] [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1611/workflows/59e81b6c-4506-400e-8370-77125536c87a]) and it started to be flaky right after ([j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1610/workflows/9ba746fc-574b-4e81-8f9a-0af278b9277d] [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1610/workflows/2eb057c6-ef97-4682-a32c-d1fa1bc2cb2d]).
