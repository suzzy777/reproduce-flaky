cc: [~smeng], any idea what's wrong here?

[~elek] I doubt this has anything to do with the FS interface. Looks like it is stuck in a lock in SCM.

OFS contract cluster config is exactly the same as o3fs ({{RootedOzoneContract#createCluster}}) so this wouldn't be a variable.

I recall seeing a mini cluster setup/teardown related bug locally that, if I setup and teardown mini cluster more than once in the same test class, access to the second cluster would get stuck and the test would time out (try {{TestOzoneManagerListVolumes}}). I was suspecting some clean up issues back then but the problem disappears in GH workflow runs. Could be related.

Could be possible. Did you see similar failures with the non o3fs? If not what can be the reason?

[~elek] I recall seeing once or twice {{it-filesystem-contract}} fails for o3fs in PR checks a long time ago. But might not be related imo.
