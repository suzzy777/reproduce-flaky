Ok, the root cause was easy to spot:

{noformat}
	err = common.WaitFor(1*time.Millisecond, 10*time.Millisecond, func() bool {
		app.RLock()
		defer app.RUnlock()
		return app.placeholderTimer == nil
	})
{noformat}

This {{WaitFor()}} call is present at different places, IMO a 10 msec timeout is way too low. Depending on how loaded the node is and Go scheduling subtleties, it's just sometimes not enough.

I suggest raising 1/10 to 10/1000 to be on the safe side.

Committed to master. Thanks [~pbacsko] for the contribution.
