In scope of making Oozie FIPS compliant, when TLS is enabled, the Oozie server expects a JKS KeyStore type even though the following Java system properties are being set:
{code:java}
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStoreType=bcfks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=bcfks{code}
The goal of ticket is to make Oozie capable of setting _keyStoreType_ and _trustStoreType_ in oozie-site.xml if it's not already set by the user.
