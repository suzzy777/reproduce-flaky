The test org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.security.token.TestDelegationTokenRenewal is @Ignor-ed. 
Due to that several classes in package org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.security.token have zero unit-test coverage.

The problem is that the test assumed that class org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.security.token.TestDelegationTokenRenewal.Renewer is used as a custom implementation of the org.apache.hadoop.security.token.TokenRenewer service, but that did not happen, because this custom service implementation was not registered. 
We solved this problem by using special classloader that is invoked to find the resource META-INF/services/org.apache.hadoop.security.token.TokenRenewer , and supplies some custom content for it. This way the custom service implementation gets instantiated.
