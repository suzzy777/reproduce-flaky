Leaving unit tests where they are under {{module/test}}, split out integration, distributed and acceptance tests into their own source sets, {{module/integrationTest}}, {{module/distributedTest}}, {{module/acceptanceTest}}, respectively. Adjust source sets's dependencies to include the minimum for that test type. For example, unit tests should not have any distributed test framework dependencies.
