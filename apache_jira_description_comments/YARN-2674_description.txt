Currently, if RM work preserving restart happens while distributed shell is running, distribute shell AM may re-launch all the containers, including new/running/complete. We must make sure it won't re-launch the running/complete containers.
We need to remove allocated containers from AMRMClientImpl#remoteRequestsTable once AM receive them from RM.
