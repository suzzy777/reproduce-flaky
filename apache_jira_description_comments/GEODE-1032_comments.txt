    GEODE-1032 : Placed additional wait time to check for empty queue, refactored WANTestBase.java to remove unused functions, replaced wait criterions with awaitility.

    GEODE-1032 : Placed additional wait time to check for empty queue, refactored WANTestBase.java to remove unused functions, replaced wait criterions with awaitility.
    
    * Added additional wait time in awaitility to check for empty queue [WANTestBase.java]
    * Replaced wait criterion  with awaitility [WANTestBase.java]
    * Removed used parameters from function signatures [WANTestBase.java]
    * Added listener to put the thread to sleep on create event so that the transmission is slowed and sender queue is not empty when the cache is closed.[testReplicatedSerialPropagationWithRemoteReceiverRestartedOnOtherNode]
    * Used the new function signature for validateRegionSize which passes time to wait as a parameter for test cases which wait for 240 seconds.
