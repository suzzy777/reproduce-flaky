As [proposed on the mailing list|https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/c550264cd60e000d77e10d9d7ac81ea8c49efc37ad447177fa8ee4ee@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E], we should add a field for application-specific metadata in DoGet payloads and expose this in the APIs. The current APIs are rather RecordBatch-oriented, though.
