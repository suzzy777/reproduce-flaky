It looks like the data is doubled up, so I guess it's more likely a data loading issue than a query execution issue. This test isn't following best practices to use unique_database, so I guess I'll try switching to that.

i don't have logs from this job so may be hard to debug further.

IMPALA-10156: test_unmatched_schema should use unique_database

This updates the test to use the unique_database fixture instead
of trying to generate a unique table name on its own.
