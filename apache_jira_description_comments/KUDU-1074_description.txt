I am running into an issue in the test environment where KuduClient::ListTables is returning me a ServiceUnavailable error.

In the test environment, it looks like this: if an ExternalMiniCluster is started, and then TestWorkload::Setup() is immediately called, there is a race between the master completing startup and marking itself as leader (even with LocalConsensus) and the call by TestWorkload to check if the table it's about to create exists. If the Master is in the middle of starting up then we get an error that looks like this, because ListTables() doesn't retry up to some timeout.
