* update Jenkins builds scripts (Cassandra-builds) for trunk to build and run tests only with JDK 11 and JDK 17 - both Jenkins-dev and post-commit
 * the JDK11+17 config files and script in cassandra/.circleci should replace the default J8+J11 test config files and script
 * Cassandra trunk build.xml and conf files should be updated - JDK8 removed everywhere
 * Any tickets blocked on this one and ready to commit should be committed
 * Revert this change in CCM - [https://github.com/riptano/ccm/commit/6e71061146f7ae67b84ccd2b1d90d7319b640e4c#diff-0999a90fd83b66b6840af0bbd8afd1ebd9648e135b0665692fa0f523325a1058L984]

NOTE: Python Upgrade tests were already switched to 11 in this [change|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/commit/52053200e75d3e6718c03bfa68232dfb94f9a566#diff-31d0989c90471274d54ccce871e5ea977ba477d1b55ee13be6f399fd844c16cfR171], so I _think_Â there is no other change pending in cassandra-dtest repo
