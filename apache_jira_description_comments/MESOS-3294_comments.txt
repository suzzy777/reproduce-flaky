This fails on CentOS 7.1 because of a open CentOS 7 bug which uses a incorrect directory name  cpuacct,cpu vs cpu,cpuacct which differs from the cgroups mount table.

We can either just assume it's not going to be fixed (no one paid attention to my bug report yet) and modify our test code to check both or just wait for CentOS to be fixed.

Let's assume it's not going to be fixed soon (or, possibly, ever) and fix our test code: I'd rather have not-so-pretty code, but a passing test, than a flaky and/or disabled one.

Thanks, Tim!
