[~jmakai] in the description you are using Hadoop 3 documentation. Can you please make sure this change is valid with Hadoop 2 too? Oozie 5.2.1 depends on Hadoop 2.

Thanks

[~dionusos] thanks for the review, based on your suggestion I've checked the valid Hadoop 2.6.0 configuration properties, but they do not contain the ones that are being added with in this change, as unfortunately they're Hadoop 3 related.
Therefore I'm closing this ticket.
