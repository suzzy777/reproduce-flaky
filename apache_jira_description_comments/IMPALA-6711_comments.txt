Assigning to you, [~tarmstrong] because you already investigated a similar issue.

The test depends on the assumption that socket.getfqdn() will return the same value in the test and the shell process. It looks like it was localhost.localdomain (based on the buffered output above) in the shell, but probably the test was looking for ec2-m2-4xlarge-centos-6-4-061d.vpc.cloudera.com (which is reported elsewhere in the test logs).

Here's where it comes from in the test:
https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/9f3c73ddbecd6eed3aa4207d58d848eef5684b2a/tests/shell/test_shell_interactive.py#L217

I'm pretty sure it comes from one of the following places in the shell:
https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/1d38c584aef2d0f852af8ee659157d00eb3b061a/shell/impala_shell.py#L742
https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/56464e4616ca624bc88faca9218ba75cb1ff582b/shell/impala_shell_config_defaults.py#L32

[~sailesh][~kwho] is there a reason why getfqdn() in Python might return different values in different processes or for different sockets?

IMPALA-6711: loosen shell test prompt regex

We have seen this test fail because the fully-qualified domain name
differed between the python test process and the impala shell process
(see JIRA for details). The exact domain name is irrelevant to the test
- we only really care about whether the prompt appeared or not.
