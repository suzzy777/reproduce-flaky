I think this change will change the generated JSONs:
{noformat}
-        for (String cName : map.keySet()) {
-            group.put(cName, map.get(cName));
+        for (Map.Entry cName : map.entrySet()) {
+            group.put(cName, cName.getValue());
{noformat}
shouldn't it be {{ group.put(cName.getKey(), cName.getValue());}} ?

[~gezapeti] You're absolutely right. I updated the patch accordingly.

Not sure, if the failing tests are flaky. Locally they are running fine.
