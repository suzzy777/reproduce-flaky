There are few issues with log streaming. We will fix following things.
1. UI has an issue with displaying "loading... done". It used to show loading done even if logs were not loaded entirely.
2. Server-server communication time out. The default time is 1 min. Setting to 3 min same as UI.
3. We use to throw an error message if log scan duration is more than configured duration. We will be truncating log.
4. No log scan duration check for audit and error log since it doesn't support log filter.
5. Different buffer.len setting for error and audit log, so that partial loading can be faster.
