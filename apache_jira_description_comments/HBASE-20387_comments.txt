Current jobs  for "find flaky tests":

* master - https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/
* branch-2.0 - https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests-branch2.0/

Note that we should keep the "run flaky tests" separate, since we probably want to keep running it more often.

messing with this on a branch has convinced me that it can't be a part of the current nightly job.  jobs that consume the include/exclude list we generate should be robust to failures (like if docker changes behavior). That means they ought to get artifacts off of the "last success build" URL. incorporating the report into the nightly job means that if any part of our nightly test suite fails, all the various test jobs will be stuck consuming an old flaky report thus missing information about a test that caused nightly to fail.

doing this as multibranch pipeline job(s) still makes sense, they'll just need to be new ones.

I have things up on a branch, waiting to finish running through things but if folks want to take a peek:

* https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests-per-branch/
* https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests-per-branch/
* https://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/HBase%20Nightly/detail/HBASE-20387/

Note that since I'm testing the jobs currently have a different name then what'll be in the patch. Specifically the jobs I like here with "FOO-per-branch" names will replace the jobs that are currently named "FOO". I'll do this by renaming jenkins jobs so that we can still dig up the old info for a bit if needed.

-v0 waiting for a complete cycle of runs, but looks like it works
  - includes a patch for HBASE-20979 because we're greatly increasing the number of jenkins API requests we make
  - moves all the flaky test related files into a subdirectory of dev-support to organize them better
  - turns 'HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests' and 'HBase-Flaky-Tests' into multibranch pipelines
  - updates all the job configs to consume the new multibranch pipeline URLs
  - any branch with these changes will get 1) a flaky report, 2) a flaky runner, 3) nightly jobs that exclude flaky tests

the patch currently breaks out the removal of the "-per-branch" job suffix in a fixup, so it's easier for me to maintain the branch that's testing these things on jenkins. it'll be squashed before commit.

this doesn't address the precommit bot because that job is still only defined in jenkins configs. it'll need to be updated once this patch lands in order to keep excluding flaky tests.

I looked through build #11 for the branch specific nightly and confirmed that it correctly consumed the list of flaky tests. Also checked the find flaky and run flaky jobs for the branch and they check out.

I think this is ready to go.

Can we add a comment to the dockerfile to denote that it is used by the flaky test reporting jobs? With multiple dockerfiles in our repo, it is hard for me to keep track of what belongs where.

With that change I'm +1 on the patch.

bq. Can we add a comment to the dockerfile to denote that it is used by the flaky test reporting jobs? With multiple dockerfiles in our repo, it is hard for me to keep track of what belongs where.

Sure. Should I try to find other things that use it in the repo and note them? I didn't put it into the directory of flaky report stuff because I was assuming it's used elsewhere.

We only count 5 builds for the flaky jobs now? This page:

https://builds.apache.org/job/HBASE-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dashboard.html

It used to be 30 I think. In the past the failing rate for some flaky tests can be less than 20%...

Thanks.


[we check the "rerun all the flaky tests" for up to 40 runs|https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/master/dev-support/flaky-tests/flaky-reporting.Jenkinsfile#L44]

{code}
          flaky_args=("${flaky_args[@]}" --urls "${JENKINS_URL}/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/job/${BRANCH_NAME}" --is-yetus False --max-builds 40)
{code}

Running once an hour, means this is about 2 days lag if a job is no longer flaky. I believe the "1/5" in the current report was just an artifact of when it ran since the flaky run job was new.

[we check nightly tests for up to 5 runs|https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/master/dev-support/flaky-tests/flaky-reporting.Jenkinsfile#L43]

{code}
          flaky_args=("${flaky_args[@]}" --urls "${JENKINS_URL}/job/HBase%20Nightly/job/${BRANCH_NAME}" --is-yetus True --max-builds 5)
{code}

Running 1/day means that it's about a work week of lag if a job is no longer flaky.

[the old job|https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests-old-just-master/configure] checked the flaky runs for 30 builds and checked the nightly tests for 6 builds.

A test has to avoid being in either list to be run in the normal builds, which means the failing rate needs to be below 2.5% to get out.

I mean it is important for me to get the full logs of the failing UTs...

If we only record 5 builds for flaky test job, lots of flaky tests will not show up on the page so it is not easy for me to get the log, unless I click the flaky test runs one by one to check whether there is failure for the specific test...

the dashboard reports all of the runs that it sees for a given test. as I mentioned before, there being 5 runs from the flaky job was just a matter of timing; the new flaky job had only run 5 times when the report you linked to was generated.

looking at the current run:

https://builds.apache.org/job/HBASE-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/master/4/artifact/dashboard.html

you can see the flaky section has up to 40 runs for some of the tests, including 3 that only have a single failure in those runs.

OK, great. Thanks.
