Sure. /cc [~megha.sharma]

Yup, should be due to a race between the task creating the file and the test looking for it. Fixing it.

    Fixed the flaky BusyMountPoint test.
    
    In GarbageCollectorIntegrationTest.BusyMountPoint there is
    a race between the task creating a file and the test looking for it
    which sometimes leads to assertion failure on the existence of the
    file.
