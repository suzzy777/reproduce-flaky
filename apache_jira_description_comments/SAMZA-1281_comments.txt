Not disabling right now since this isn't frequent, but creating ticket for tracking in case this happens again.

Another test in this class failed on Jenkins:

{code}
:samza-kafka_2.11:test

brokerProxySkipsFetchForEmptyRequests FAILED
    java.lang.AssertionError: 
        at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:91)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:43)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:54)

84 tests completed, 1 failed
:samza-kafka_2.11:test FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
{code}

Investigated the failure and it turns out to be a race condition between the main test thread and another thread within BrokerProxy that is responsible for running the main message fetching loop and updating metrics. The race condition is caused by the test's use of Thread.sleep() to allow some time for the BrokerProxy's thread to fetch messages and update metrics, an unreliable technique. I don't have enough visibility into how BrokerProxy is used, which is necessary to assess what the appropriate scope of a fix should be.
