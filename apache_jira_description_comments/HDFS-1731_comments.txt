    HDFS-1731. Amend previous commit for this JIRA to fix build on Cygwin. Contributed by Todd Lipcon


Hi Todd,

In Hadoop, we only put one entry per JIRA in CHANGES.txt.  Could you combine the HDFS-1731 entries?

{noformat}
    HDFS-1731. Allow using a file to exclude certain tests from build (todd)

    HDFS-1736. Remove the dependency from DatanodeJspHelper to FsShell.

    HDFS-1731. Amend previous commit for this JIRA to fix build on Cygwin.

Hi Nicholas. Would you prefer that the "amend" commit be entirely removed, or that both messages be collapsed under one heading?

ie:
{noformat}
    HDFS-1731. Allow using a file to exclude certain tests from build (todd)
               Amend previous commit for this JIRA to fix build on Cygwin. (todd)
{noformat}
or just:
{noformat}
    HDFS-1731. Allow using a file to exclude certain tests from build (todd)
{noformat}

The later is better.  We usually put a short description in CHANGES.txt for what we do in the issue.  This is what most people care.  For multiple commits, we could track them in svn logs.

OK, thanks for clarifying. I've fixed this in svn.

That's great! Thanks.
