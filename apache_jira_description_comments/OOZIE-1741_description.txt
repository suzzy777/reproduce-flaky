Currently oozie provides coord EL functions to get partition filter string (where key-values are separated by AND)  for various action types - java/pig/hive. However this doesn't work in other cases, e.g. hive action that performs export/import of hive partition. In that case, the partition value is expected to be in a different format: (col1="value1",col2="value2"...). We need to add a new EL function that returns partition value in the above format.
