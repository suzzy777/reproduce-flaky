[~divijvaidya] should we actually consider this as a blocker for the 3.7 release?

 

[~divijvaidya] [~Kamal C] Any idea in which case it is possible to have the above failed scenario. I can try reproducing locally. 

Considering this not a blocker for 3.7 and changing the target fix version to 3.8 since this is  we are cutting a 3.7 RC and this is blocking it
