During making the code patch for YARN-8059, I come across a flaky test, see this link: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/22412/artifact/out/patch-unit-hadoop-yarn-project_hadoop-yarn_hadoop-yarn-server_hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager.txt

This is the error message: 
{code:java}
[ERROR] Tests run: 108, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 19.37 s <<< FAILURE! - in org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.fair.TestFairScheduler
[ERROR] testChildMaxResources(org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.fair.TestFairScheduler) Time elapsed: 0.164 s <<< FAILURE!
java.lang.AssertionError: App 1 is not running with the correct number of containers expected:<2> but was:<0>
 at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88){code}
So the thing is, even if we had 8 node updates, due to the nature of how we handle the events, it can happen that no container is allocated for the application.
