Currently, the website tests run in a vanilla Linux environment, which require a prerequisite step to install Ruby. The install script is flaky and adds extra time to the job.

Instead, we should run the website pre-commits inside the pre-built ruby/2.5 docker image so that we don't need to worry about installing extra dependencies.
