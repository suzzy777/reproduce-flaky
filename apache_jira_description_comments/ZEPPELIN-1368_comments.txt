    ZEPPELIN-1368. interpreter-setting.json may be loaded mutliple times

    ### What is this PR for?
    here're several ways to load interpreter-setting.json, but for now we will load it multiple times. It is supposed to load only once. We should load it by the following orders
             * 1. Register it from path {ZEPPELIN_HOME}/interpreter/{interpreter_name}/ interpreter-setting.json
             * 2. Register it from interpreter-setting.json in classpath {ZEPPELIN_HOME}/interpreter/{interpreter_name}
             * 3. Register it by Interpreter.register
    
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    [Bug Fix]
    
    ### Todos
    * [ ] - Task
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    * https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1368
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    Check the log that each interpreter is registered once. And also modify file interpreter/spark/interpreter-setting.json to make pyspark as the default interpreter and it works. Before this PR, it doesn't work, because it would be override by interpreter-setting.json in `interpreter/spark/zeppelin-spark_2.10-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

    ### Questions:
    * Does the licenses files need update? No
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? No
    * Does this needs documentation? No
