This seems more severe than your usual bug, no?

Yes, I agree that this earns the "critical" badge.

I'm also putting it up for debate whether to hold the 2.21.0 release until this is fixed. Mitigation is in the PR.

Is this a regression, or something that never worked?

I'm not sure if it was working at some point and broke due to introducing new features. It appears to be untested, so it likely never worked. It was relatively easy to fix though, see the PR.
