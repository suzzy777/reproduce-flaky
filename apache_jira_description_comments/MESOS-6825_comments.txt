> This means that if the host running the tests is slow, a test case might receive a resource offer that it doesn't receive when running on a faster host.

Did you mean that if the "task" in question in the test reaches a terminal state? This shouldn't happen otherwise if the "used" resources on the agent did not change (task is active)

I don't follow. There are lots of different situations in which a test might arrange a situation in which the next batch allocation would result in making a resource offer, e.g.:

{noformat}
$ ag Clock::advance src/tests | grep allocation_interval | wc -l
    103
{noformat}

If the test exited instead (and the clock wasn't paused), all these situations would result in flakiness.
