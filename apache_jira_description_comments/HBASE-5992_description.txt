The region move implementation now has now a similar behavior whatever the destination server is specified or not. This allows:
 - to benefit from the improvement in HBASE-5877
 - as a side effect to have the coprocessors calls when the destination server is not specified
 
This includes various fixes around draining servers. Draining servers were not excluded during a bulk assign. This is now fixed.
