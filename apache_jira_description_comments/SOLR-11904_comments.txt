I built a PR to work around this: https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/100

Thanks [~tboeghk] ... I think [~mdrob]'s suggested solution is best here. I'll start working on getting the PKI approach to work.

[~tboeghk] ... I put up a 1-liner fix for this (it may not be the final solution and still needs a test) but should get you unblocked for now, thanks again to [~kchristoudias] for reporting this!
