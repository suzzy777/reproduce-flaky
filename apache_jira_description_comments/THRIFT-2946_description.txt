This patch makes cross test script more accessible with:
* Reduced burden of preparation
* Reduced execution time
* Error reporting for newly introduced failrues

Major enhancement:
* Automake target that builds cross test dependencies, without invoking all the "make check" tests
* Parallel execution
* Tests known to be failing are listed in "known_failures_<platform>.json".
   If anything not listed fails, developers/buildbots are notified with clear message/return code.
