We should add the possibility to transactionally check if a Table parameter is changed before altering the table in the HMS.

This would provide an alternative, less error-prone and faster way to commit an Iceberg table, as the Iceberg table currently needs to:
- Create an exclusive lock
- Get the table metadata to check if the current snapshot is not changed
- Update the table metadata
- Release the lock

After the change these 4 HMS calls could be substituted with a single alter table call.
Also we could avoid cases where the locks are left hanging by failed processes
