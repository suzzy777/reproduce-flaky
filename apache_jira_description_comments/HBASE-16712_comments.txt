I've worked hard to keep Xerces out of our dependency set. Historically Hadoop's use of the dependency has been limited to some tools that we don't directly use (IIRC, the fsimage exporter). Is this dependency now required or can we keep it out?

another bit on that Xerces dependency, there's supposed to be an enforcer rule that barfs on xercesImpl; did it not correctly yell about the inclusion? I don't see it getting removed in the patch.

looking at the brought in dependencies, do you happen to have a tree list handy of how they get brought in? can we exclude more of them (curator-test, for example, is extremely suspicious as something needed to talk to HDFS)? Is the hadoop 3 profile making use of a different Hadoop dependency than Hadoop 2 profile? A quick skim shows that it includes a dependency on hadoop-annotations, is that needed?

{code}

{code}

what's bringing in the go license, and can we update the uspplementation information for it to properly name the BSD 3 clause instead? As-is, I think this changeset will improperly include an entry in NOTICE for such a licensed work, when it should only be in LICENSE.

I don't think this will actually error out the build. Could you include a failure inducing error with a pointer for fixing, [like the out of bounds access in LICENSE.vm|https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/e51fcdd7788271d33cf02240155429358d71627b/hbase-resource-bundle/src/main/resources/META-INF/LICENSE.vm#L1675]?

Let me do a 'mvn clean install -DskipTests' with the different profiles, and then I'll attach the deps for h2 and h3. I recently learned that 'mvn install' is required for dependency:tree to give the right information.

For the go license can you be more specific about what you suggest we do?

Some of the failures wiht ${dep.licenses.isEmpty()} actually fail until the next line which you didn't include which does a ${dep.license[0]...) and gets a very cryptic array out of bounds error.  I actually got the new list by repeated going through looking at this output, "fixing it", and then trying again until all were addressed.  I'll leave more explicit comments in the next rev.

We should have that (for LICENSE.vm and NOTICE.vm) error message googlable in our docs so that others who run into it don't have to struggle to figure this out as much.

Right, but those lines could change and all a person gets is a line number in the NOTICE.vm file to look at. That's why the LICENSE.vm file has an explicit failure condition as a part of the "something is wrong" check, with a comment that tells folks they need to look at the partially generated file for the cause.

agreed. I thought we had an open JIRA for this, but it turns out I was thinking of the one to redo things to rely on the enforcer plugin (HBASE-16351).

BSD-3 clause licensed dependencies are only supposed to be mentioned in the LICENSE file, not hte NOTICE file. So either we can include a supplemental xml update that says re2j is BSD-3 clause instead of 'the go license', or we should update the processing in the NOTICE file to ensure we don't include any information for dependencies that use the go license.

Thanks, that sounds good. Hadoop has been publishing an unneeded dependency on Xerces since 2.6 or 2.7. This might mean they're just leaking it from a different place, or it might mean that there is actually a need for downstream clients now. I'd like us to know which it is before considering starting to ship Xerces.

h2-deps has dependency:tree with default hadoop2 profile, while h3-deps has hadoop.profile=3.0 

Oops, too quick - something is not right with the deps files -- they are nearly identical, let me try again.

updated h3-deps to a dependency:tree that acutally has h3 in it. :)

The strange thing is that there is no xerces in the tree!  If you comment out the xerces bit in the supplemental, you end up with the error I posted earlier.  Where else would this dependency get pulled in from?

{quote}

yeah, this is very strange. Can you run the build that fails with a -X and then post the log?

or if you're unsure about what kind of information gets shred about your build environment with maven in debug mode, you could send me the log out of band.

[~busbey] check out the last commit here -- I've included the h?-deps and a log file with a -X of a 'mvn install -Dhadoop.profile=3.0.

https://github.com/jmhsieh/hbase/commits/hbase-16712

hurm. looking at the logs, some stuff looks messed up because of the SNAPSHOT version. Any reason we can't switch from 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT to 3.0.0-alpha1?

No reason we shouldn't be able to that I'm aware of.

I'll create a new jira to point there and send an email to dev@hbase to give a heads up.

dependency:tree uses the old maven 2 dependency walking, so that might explain a discrepancy in how it see the tree and how the remote resources plugin sees it. from the log, looks like xerces is coming from hadoop-hdfs test-jar, which is coming from hadoop-minicluster. but we exclude it from those in both the hadoop2 and hadoop3 profiles.

v2 changes how we handle the go license, and adds an explicit fail in NOTICE.vm.  Doesn't handle xerces yet since I'm still investigating what to do there.

In the next version I'll update the hadoop 3 version  to 3.0.0-alpha1.  

[~busbey] and I did some experiments.  The xercesImpl being brought in seems to be a bug in mvn (I'm using 3.3.9) not propagaing the excludes properly when using -Dprofile.hadoop=3.0 .  If I force the hadoop.profile to use 3.0 by chaning the pom like below things work.

the xerces exclude is not needed in the hadoop3.0 profile.

I plan on documenting this in the example.  

v3 attached with explaination for xercesImpl mvn bug, bump to hadoop-3.0.0-alpha1 and specific versions for new supplemented dependencies.

note on the experiments mentioned earlier -- you can see that xerces gets brought in from hadoop-hdfs / hadoop-minicluster / ... in the compile and test scope when -Dhadoop.profile=3.0 is used.

{code}
# hadoop 3
mvn -X clean install -DskipTests -Dhadoop.profile=3.0

# hadoop 2
mvn -X clean install -DskipTests

# change default pom to be against hadoop3 - 
mvn -X clean install -DskipTests
{code}

Will fix whitespaces on commit.

Tests shouldn't be affected by this patch.
TestAdmin2, TestSnapshotCloneIndependence are on the flaky page.
TestHCM was flakey for me locally, but I don't see how this would affect it.

+1. Once this goes in, I'd like to make a follow on to switch from including a supplemental entry for Xerces to skipping it in LICENSE/NOTICE since we know it's not actually bundled.

Thanks for the review [~busbey].  Committed to master.
