TestShell was excluded because it's in the list of untrusted tests ([this dashboard|https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/25679/artifact/dashboard.html] I think). So what's the specific suggestion here Ted?

If TestShell is skipped, QA bot shouldn't state:

bq. hbase-shell in the patch passed

Is this specific to TestShell? Do you want the bot to say something different if any given module has any tests in the exclusion list?

What's the pro/con for QABot saying "+0 hbase-shell passed, but it had excluded tests" vs updating the QABot to ensure any tests changed by the submitted patch are run?

I believe this is a duplicate of HBASE-19265
