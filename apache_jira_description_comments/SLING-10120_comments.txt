* started work on parent 40 switch see [this PR|https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-event/pull/10]
* the problem currently with that PR is that it still doesn't work with java11 for ITs (unit tests are fine) : it complains about missing osgi.ee dependencies..  eg:

* I started upgrading the outdated bundle versions in AbstractJobHandlingTest but think that might be more work - as updating versions there requires a full functioning set of versions

I'm wondering if we should go ahead with above PR and do a new vote on that to get sling.event 4.2.16 out - or if we should also include java11 support for ITs ..

Also open for any input.

Parent 40 contains a SNAPSHOT and I can only recommend to use Testing PaxExam instead of setting up the testing manually. There are [several projects|https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-testing-paxexam/network/dependents] running integration tests successful on 8, 11 and 14.

Thx for the input. I'll have a look at those projects. Re theÂ [snapshot|https://github.com/apache/sling-parent/blob/sling-parent-reactor-40/sling-parent/pom.xml#L213] dependency that is indeed not ideal but I don't think it would be a problem for sling-event?

[~stefanegli] - I think you can also use parent 39, the changes to 40 don't seem relevant to you - see https://github.com/apache/sling-parent/compare/sling-parent-reactor-39...sling-parent-reactor-40 .

* while originally aiming for parent 40 it became parent 41 in the end
 * [PR|https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-event/pull/10] now merged
 * marking resolved
