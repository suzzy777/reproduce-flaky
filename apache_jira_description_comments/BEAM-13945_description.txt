BQ has a new JSON type that is defined here: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#json_type

We should update Beam BQ Java and Python connectors to support that for various read methods (export jobs, storage API) and write methods (load jobs, streaming inserts, storage API).

We should also add integration tests that exercise reading from /writing to BQ tables with columns that has JSON type.
