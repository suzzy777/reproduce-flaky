[~neilc] we try to include good vs bad logs in flaky test reports as it lowers the barrier to looking into the issue (don't need to go digging around CI or compile / run it locally to get logs for a good run). For example: MESOS-4800.

I'm going to tentatively close this as the following appears to be a fix:

    Fixed the flaky SlaveRecoveryTest.* failures upon TearDown.

    During TearDown of ContainerizerTest<slave::MesosContainerizer>,
    we attempt to destroy all cgroups that we can find within the
    cgroup root. We observed in CI that on some distributions it
    appears that the freeze is not instantaneous and the freezer
    delay is needed to complete the destroy process. Howevever,
    the clock may be paused at this point which can lead to the
    TearDown failing to destroy!

    There does not appear to be a listener hook to run code before
    test tear down, so a one-off Clock::resume here seems to be the
    simplest route.

It's not clear why on some distributions the freeze seems to not be instantaneous on the empty cgroup, but this should make the tear down less brittle in general. Let's open a new ticket if there turns out to be more flakiness here.
