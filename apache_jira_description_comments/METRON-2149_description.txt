The Maven Shade plugin is used in several modules for packaging up code assets into a single, executable jar.  There is an option to use a classifier but it is used the inconsistently:  about half of the modules use it while others don't.  This causes inconsistent mvn dependency resolution and it might be worth investigating a consistent strategy.
