   the `metdata` stores the information in a `HashMap` does not guarentee the order of elements. The order of the elements can change in the `toString` function. I have updated the test to take this into account.

   Thank you for this.  I haven't seen this flakiness, but now that I look at the code and your changes, I can definitely see the problem.  Would you be able to use TikaTest's assertContains?  Thank you, again!
