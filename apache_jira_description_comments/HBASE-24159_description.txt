As reported in [https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-2.3/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dashboard.html#job_1,]Â 

testCleanMergeReference fails when waiting for merge table in meta table to be cleaned.

Debugged a bit, found that this is case that state is polluted from other testing cases.

Â 

the meta table is polluted from the previous region merge test cases (tables are not deleted after the testing case finishes). While compaction still goes on and janitor kicks in, it will clean up the old table state and breaks the loop (cleaned > 0), so leave the state under test never cleaned up.The solution is to delete tables after each test case.
