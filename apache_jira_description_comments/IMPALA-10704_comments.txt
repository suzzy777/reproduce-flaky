IMPALA-10704: Fix retried query id not being unregistered when retry fails

When query retry fails in RetryQueryFromThread(), the retried query id
may not be unregistered if the failure happens before we store the
retry_request_state. In this case, QueryDriver::Unregister() has no way
to get the retried query id so it's not deleted. Note that the retried
query id is registered in RetryQueryFromThread() so should be deleted
later. This finally results in a leak in the query driver map, where
queries in it are shown as in-flight queries.

test_retry_query_result_cacheing_failed and
test_retry_query_set_query_in_flight_failed (added in IMPALA-10413)
asserts one in-flight query at the end. This is satisfied by the leak.
Instead, we should verify no running queries at the end.

This patch adds a new field in QueryDriver to remember the registered
retry query id as a backup way for getting it when query retry fails
before we store the ClientRequestState of the retried query (so
retried_client_request_state_ is null).

Tests:
 - Run test_retry_query_result_cacheing_failed and
   test_retry_query_set_query_in_flight_failed 100 times.
