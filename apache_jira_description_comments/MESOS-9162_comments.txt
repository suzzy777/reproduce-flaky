And the complete diagnostics bundle, just in case. [^diagnostics.zip] 

We had another manifestation of the unkillable pod task, however in a different test. There is one thing that those tests all do - 
1. they start  a pod
2. kill it (either on the agent directly or through the Marathon)
3. restart the pod

The test *never fails in step1* but *always in step 3*. Also, all tests use the same pod definition *which uses volume*.

I'll not attach new logs since the symptoms (container stuck in ISOLATING) look the same.
