This is discussed in the [Beam-Site Automation Reliability|https://s.apache.org/beam-site-automation] design, under "Pre-Commit Job Filtering"

The proposal is to filter pre-commit job triggered on PR's based on which files are touched. The impact is that most PRs will only run one set of relevant tests, rather than all three. This will decrease test overhead and the impact of flaky tests.
