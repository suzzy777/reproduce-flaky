CDC creates a hard link on {{[CommitLogSegmentManagerCDC.createSegment()|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/commitlog/CommitLogSegmentManagerCDC.java#L149]}} but this happens in an async operation originating at {{AbstractCommitLogSegmentManager.start()}}. We can see [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1074/files#diff-b5c6007ec3a4b31965b4dc10e8c8c50766237f1ce8ac88011035b91215060fc8R51] the test calls {{cleanup()}} just after staring the commit log service. This can remove files from under the commit log's feet making the hardlinking fail. We need to wait for completion.

It can be repro'd easily in a 1K circle run and the fix indeed passes now

Good catch, +1. I believe this is a trick used also in other tests.

I went over over all other uses before moving this one into review and I didn't see more uses of it, but happy to be corrected if you find any.
