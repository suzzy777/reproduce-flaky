Provide an easy way to configure a process-wide serialization filter for use on Java 8. When enabled, validate-serializable-objects should be enabled and the process-wide serialization filter should be configured to accept only JDK classes and Geode classes in addition to anything the user might specify with serializable-object-filter.

To configure a process-wide filter, specifiy geode.enableGlobalSerialFilter=true and then configure serializable-object-filter with any serializable domain objects provided by the user.
