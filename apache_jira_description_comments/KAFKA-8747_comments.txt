stanislavkozlovski commented on pull request #7320: KAFKA-8747: Fix the flaky ControllerEventManagerTest#testEventQueueTimeQuery test
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7320
 
 
   This patch adds retry functionality to the testEventQueueTime test assertion
   The test has been flaky, presumably due to some race condition with Yammer's JMX reporter and when the tested histogram metric gets updated.
