Value of: *reinterpret_cast<bool*>(result)
  Actual: false
Expected: expected_result
Which is: true
unix_timestamp() between 1446367138 and 1446367148

Here is the relevant expr-test code (not sure exactly which of the two statements failed):
{code}
  // Test that the epoch is reasonable. Allow a few seconds to compensate for execution
  // time.
  int tolerance_in_seconds = 5;
  time_t unix_time = (posix_time::microsec_clock::local_time() - from_time_t(0))
      .total_seconds();
  stringstream expr_sql;
  expr_sql << "unix_timestamp() between " << unix_time - tolerance_in_seconds
      << " and " << unix_time + tolerance_in_seconds;
  TestValue(expr_sql.str(), TYPE_BOOLEAN, true);
  {
    ScopedLocalUnixTimestampConversionOverride use_local;
    unix_time = time(NULL);
    expr_sql.str("");
    expr_sql << "unix_timestamp() between " << unix_time - tolerance_in_seconds
        << " and " << unix_time + tolerance_in_seconds;
    TestValue(expr_sql.str(), TYPE_BOOLEAN, true);
  }
{code}

My guess is that there was some hiccup in the VM causing it to hang for > 5 seconds, but I don't know if there's any way to verify this. I can't find any BE test logs (maybe I don't know where to look...). Marking as a flaky test for now.
