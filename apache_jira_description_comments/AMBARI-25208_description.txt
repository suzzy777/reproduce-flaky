Ambari should provide an API level implementation to enable replication between 2 HBase clusters.

In HBase, cluster replication refers to keeping one cluster state synchronized with that of another cluster, using the write-ahead log (WAL) of the source cluster to propagate the changes. Replication is enabled at column family granularity.

As part of this JIRA, we can provide functionality to add/remove peer cluster keys to existing HBase cluster.
