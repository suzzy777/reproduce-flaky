Happened in GVO: https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-from-scratch/3427/testReport/junit/org.apache.impala.planner/S3PlannerTest/org_apache_impala_planner_S3PlannerTest/

I've seen this again on the S3 tests.

This appears to be a test infra bug rather than a product bug. It hasn't happened for 6 months and we've had no movement on it, so let's close for now.

I saw this issue occuring again. I am reopening the ticket, but lower the priority, as this seems to be a very rare bug.

Recent runs are hitting this issue.Â 

This looks like it happens very occasionally. Maybe I'll try bumping the timeout to see if that's sufficient.

Ran into it in https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-from-scratch/16690/. Do tests capture Impala logs anywhere to look at what else might be going on?
