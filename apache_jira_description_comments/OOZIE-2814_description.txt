OOZIE-2687 will add in a whole set of newer schemas that are more Yarn-centric.  Most, if not all, examples currently use pretty old versions of the schemas.  We should take this opportunity to update the examples to the newest schemas added by OOZIE-2687, which should help demonstrate them.

It may make sense to keep the older schemas too, to show that older workflows still work.  We have some examples where we have two workflow XML files that do the same thing in different ways.
