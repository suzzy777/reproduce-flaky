Update done can be seen in this [trunk diff|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...ekaterinadimitrova2:cassandra:upgrade-dependencies].

CI  [didn't show any issues|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=upgrade-dependencies], two tests failed which are known flakies. 

[~dcapwell], [~marcuse], [~benedict] anyone of you up for review?  You were adding before those dependencies (at least asm and bytebuddy) so I figured it will be worth it to ask you as you might see something I am missing. :) 

Or maybe [~brandon.williams] , [~maedhroz] or [~mck] can take a look? :) 

We should probably check with Jenkins too: [!https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1887/badge/icon!|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Cassandra-devbranch/detail/Cassandra-devbranch/1887/pipeline]


Fair point, thanks for pushing it to CI :) 

The only new failure was a timeout, and I confirmed it was environmental by running the upgrade test locally. +1

Thanks [~brandon.williams], I also do not really expect the Python Dtests to be affected but who knows. :) Thanks for testing 

Well, it was an upgrade test so it seemed worth checking :)

Always! Thanks :) 

I noticed the branch is already 6 days old so I rebased and pushed the pre-commit tests in CircleCI for last sanity check. Let me know if you want me still to push again to Jenkins, looking into the changes in the past week I think it will be overkill.

I concur, it's not necessary.

The CI runs completed. Python DTests job marked as failed but when we open [the results|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1877/workflows/71dfcea3-69f5-42a6-a8e6-86d0d7e22c3e/jobs/14750] all tests have passed and the number is the same as in the previous  [run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1876/workflows/f64b3ed2-161b-43df-a0f9-af4b2429e86a/jobs/14707] so I don't think we need to spend more time on that.

The unit tests - I didn't find it failing in Butler or a ticket filed but I found it mentioned as failing on another ticket CASSANDRA-17416. It doesn't fail locally for me so it seems as just another flaky test...

I will see to file a Jira ticket- testNonFrozenEmptyCollection[0: clusterMinVersion=3.0]
