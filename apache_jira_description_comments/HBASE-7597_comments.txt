I haven't seen this test fail for a while now, so this can be closed.

[~jmspaggi] Thanks for he housekeeping.

It failed again:  https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-0.95/82/
Let me reopen it and take a look if I can do something about it.

In the log file, it shows the region is not deployed according to hbck although it is.  I added some checking (the same way as in hbck) to make sure the region is deployed before running hbck.

+1

IMO, exploratory/debug is fine to commit trying to figure whats up on jenkins (since it hard to reproduce its context elsewhere).

I ran the test several times locally and it is green.  I checked it in for trunk and 0.95.  Let's keep this open for a while to see if the problem happens again.

The original patch doesn't fix the flakiness apparently.

Looked into it and found out the root of the flakiness:  AM can auto close the region if the table is disabled.

Attached a new fix: open the region directly on the region server instead of using HRegionServer#openRegion, which notifies AM through ZK about this region.

With the new patch, I ran the test 60 time on my box, and it didn't fail.

+1 on trying it Jimmy (I heart test-fixers)
