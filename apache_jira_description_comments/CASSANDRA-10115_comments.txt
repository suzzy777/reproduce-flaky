Attaching a patch that doubles the rows and cols on the test to try and ensure deeper levels as I'm getting non-deterministic counts of the levels from local test runs, although none are off enough to have an empty L2 and thus cause test failure.

Assuming the invariant that L0 count being == 1 sstable means deeper levels are completed (waitForLeveling relies on this), the only thing that really makes sense here is that we're skirting the edge of having enough data for both an L1 and L2.

Added a bit more debug logging surrounding a failure and snapshot the counts so conditional check and printed results are from (close to) an atomic point in time.

Adding [~krummas] as reviewer since he's worked on this code (and knows All Things Compaction).

Pushed follow-up commit {{ab6287612e8c7d8b944d3833ca90bd8b887b9709}} that ups the rows / cols for all tests on LeveledCompactionStrategyTest after another failure on Windows, same assertion, different test.
