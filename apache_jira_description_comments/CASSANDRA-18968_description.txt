Starting up a new 4.X node on a 3.x cluster throws the following warning:

{noformat}
WARN  [main] 2023-10-27 15:58:22,234 StartupClusterConnectivityChecker.java:183 - Timed out after 10002 milliseconds, was waiting for remaining peers to connect: {dc1=[X.Y.Z.W, A.B.C.D]}
{noformat}

I think this is because the PING messages used by the startup check are not available on 3.X.

To provide a smoother upgrade experience we should probably disable this check on a mixed version clusters, or skip peers on versions < 4.x when doing the connectivity check.
