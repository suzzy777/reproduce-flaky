    [GEODE-2191] Test randomized string serialization/deserialization.

    I added this test partly as an exercise in getting used to the Geode codebase, and partly because I'd like to see more randomized testing. The random string generator isn't perfect (I don't think all codepoints in that range are valid), but for our purposes it should be fine.

    [GEODE-2191] Test randomized string serialization/deserialization.

It seems like a unit test that tests random data would be a test that is flaky if it ever fails. If it does fail will the test exception tell you how to rerun the test with the same data so you can reproduce the failure?

    @kirklund I disagree. We expect string serialization to work reliably on *all* inputs, and since we can't test all of them, we may as well test a bunch picked at random. If we fail, it's because of a corner case we haven't thought of. I would rather catch it randomly in testing than when a customer wants to store strings we hadn't anticipated. The seed is captured and printed so that we can reproduce the failure.
    
    There are cases where random input could show deficiencies in our test or testing environment rather than in the code under test; I don't think this is one of those.

    I like the capturing of the randomseed for repeatability. I guess that would be my main concern.
