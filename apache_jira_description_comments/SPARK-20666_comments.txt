This doesn't fail just on Windows. It's been failing in PR builders also (e.g. https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/76605/testReport).

In a private branch of mine I ran into this problem and have this workaround:
https://github.com/vanzin/spark/pull/22/files#diff-edd374dbb96bc16363b65dab1e554793R114

But that's not cleanly "backportable" at the moment, and I don't know if it's the right solution either.

(BTW my fix is in SQL, which also suffers from this, so it would not help these mllib tests...)

[~cloud_fan] do you think your fix for SPARK-12837 could have caused this? I've only noticed this error recently, and that's the only recent change in accumulator code...

A quick look at it didn't flag anything, though.

I'm raising the severity because lots of PRs are failing because of these kinds of errors...
