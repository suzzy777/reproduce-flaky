This issue is very similar to the one described in HBASE-11354. The method createAndStart in MovedRegionsCleaner creates an instance of the chore but never starts the underlying thread:

{code}
    static MovedRegionsCleaner createAndStart(HRegionServer rs){
      Stoppable stoppable = new Stoppable() {
        private volatile boolean isStopped = false;
        @Override public void stop(String why) { isStopped = true;}
        @Override public boolean isStopped() {return isStopped;}
      };

      return new MovedRegionsCleaner(rs, stoppable);
    }
{code}

Nobody has noticed this issue so far so the Chore may not be that important
