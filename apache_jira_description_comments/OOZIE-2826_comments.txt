Joda time needs to be >= 2.8.1 to work on recent Java 8 & Java 7 JVMs; 2.5 isn't going to work there. Sorry

updated joda-time to the latest available in Maven Central, which is 2.9.9. Ran ./bin/mkdistro.sh -DskipTests=true and built successfully.

IIRC, Oozie itself doesn't use joda-time; it's only here for Pig.  We need to make sure that Pig is okay with upping the version.

[~rkanter] Pig uses joda-time 2.9.3, https://github.com/apache/pig/blob/trunk/ivy/libraries.properties#L60 so bumping to at least that should work? Which begs the question, how do we keep versions in sync across Pig and Oozie? I removed joda-time from main pom and bumped the version in pig sharelib to 2.9.9 and it compiled successfully, pending the full suite of tests of course. [~rohini] please advise, should I file a jira against Pig to bump it to 2.9.9 or change Oozie dep to 2.9.3?

bq. should I file a jira against Pig to bump it to 2.9.9 or change Oozie dep to 2.9.3?
   Increase version in Pig. Always better to have latest joda-time as it ships updated timezone data.

[~rkanter] filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-5251 to match joda-time 2.9.9 to the one in Oozie, tests pass locally. I removed joda-time from main pom.

PIG-5251 was merged to Pig trunk. Joda-time now matches the Pig and Oozie Pig sharelib version. Please review.

joda-time is now being used in core so my original patch doesn't work, put joda back into main pom, sharelib/pig tests pass successfully. Couldn't run full suite successfully due to flaky tests.
