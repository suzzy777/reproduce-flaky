The current behavior of the Sqoop action is:
{noformat}
The Sqoop command can be specified either using the command element or multiple arg elements.
When using the command element, Oozie will split the command on every space into multiple arguments.
When using the arg elements, Oozie will pass each argument value as an argument to Sqoop.
{noformat}

This prevents the user to simply copy-paste the command worked in the shell into the workflow.xml.
We should split the <command> field by taking quotes into account, similar to what OOZIE-2391
did for the Spark action's <spark-opts> field.
