Any leads will be appreciated. 
[~liuml07] could you please look into this.
Thank you



[~AK2019] I'm not seeing this errors in our daily build because we are not on this 2.2 release. Tests are failing for different reasons, so you can check status of each failing test by searching in JIRA. Perhaps they have been addressed in later releases, for e.g. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-22637?jql=text%20~%20TestMetaTableMetrics%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC If they have been fixed in later releases, you can either backport to your fork, or upgrade your version if that fits.

Each time different tests are failing and running the same again either builds successfully or gives some different failures.
And the failing tests are many a times not repeated.


I am facing the similar issue with hbase-server project. I used the latest code from master branch but still the tests failed intermittently.

[ERROR] Failures:
[ERROR] TestCompactingToCellFlatMapMemStore.testForceCopyOfBigCellIntoImmutableSegment:900 i=1 expected:<8389924> but was:<8389992>
[ERROR] TestRegionReplicasWithRestartScenarios.testWhenRestart:135->assertReplicaDistributed:141
[ERROR] TestReplicationStatus.testReplicationStatus:98 failed to get ReplicationLoadSourceList
