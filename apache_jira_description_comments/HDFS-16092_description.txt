We use LayoutFlags to represent features that EditLog/FSImage can support. The utility helps write int (0) to given OutputStream and if EditLog/FSImage supports Layout flags, they read the value from InputStream to confirm whether there are unsupported feature flags (non zero int). However, we also create and return new object of LayoutFlags, which is not used anywhere because it's just a utility to read/write to/from given stream. We should remove such redundant objects from getting created while reading from InputStream using LayoutFlags#read utility.
