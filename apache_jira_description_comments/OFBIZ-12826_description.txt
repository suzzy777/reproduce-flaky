This improvement will enhance the functionality of the OFBiz build by publishing build scans to [ge.apache.org|https://ge.apache.org/], hosted by the Apache Software Foundation and run in partnership between the ASF and Gradle. This Gradle Enterprise instance has all features and extensions enabled and is freely available for use by the Apache OFBiz project and all other Apache projects.

On this Gradle Enterprise instance, Apache OFBiz will have access not only to all of the published build scans but other aggregate data features such as:
 * Dashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance trends over time
 * Build failure analytics for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures
 * Test failure analytics to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests

If interested in exploring a fully populated Gradle Enterprise instance, please explore the Maven builds already connected to [ge.apache.org|https://ge.apache.org/], the [Spring project’s instance|https://ge.spring.io/scans?search.relativeStartTime=P28D&search.timeZoneId=Europe/Zurich], or any number of other [OSS projects|https://gradle.com/enterprise-customers/oss-projects/] for which we sponsor instances of Gradle Enterprise.
