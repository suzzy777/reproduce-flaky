Observed again today in run 4432 in a CentOS 7 environment.

Hmm just saw this again, with the following puzzling error message:
{code}
/home/centos/workspace/mesos/Mesos_CI-build/FLAG/CMake/label/mesos-ec2-centos-7/mesos/src/tests/containerizer/cgroups_isolator_tests.cpp:473
Expected: (0.30) >= (cpuTime), actual: 0.3 vs 0.3
{code}

Saw this just now on a CI run on Centos7:
{noformat}
14:48:39  Expected: (0.30) >= (cpuTime), actual: 0.3 vs 0.32
{noformat}

And again on Centos7:
{noformat}
17:12:36 Â Expected: (0.30) >= (cpuTime), actual: 0.3 vs 0.31{noformat}

Same again on Centos 7 - I'm starting to see a pattern ;)

{noformat}
Expected: (0.30) >= (cpuTime), actual: 0.3 vs 0.3
{noformat}

Observed a similar flake, albeit on Ubuntu 16.04.

The comment in the test basically states that this test is flaky by design:
{code}
 // Expect that no more than 300 ms of cpu time has been consumed. We 
 // also check that at least 50 ms of cpu time has been consumed so 
 // this test will fail if the host system is very heavily loaded. 
 // This behavior is correct because under such conditions we aren't 
 // actually testing the CFS cpu limiter.
 {code}

Updated CFS tests to avoid checking CPU usage.

This verification is error-prone and leads to flaky test
failures. It is sufficient to verify that the cgroup values
are set correctly. We will avoid going so far as to confirm
that the kernel's scheduler is honoring those values.
