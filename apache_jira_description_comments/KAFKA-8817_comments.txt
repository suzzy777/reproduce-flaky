   I bumped into this flaky test while working on another PR. It's a bit different from the reported PR, where it actually timed out at parsing localhost:port already. I think what we should really test is that the closing call can complete, so I removed the whole test timeout and add the timeout for the shutdown latch instead.

[~cpettitt-confluent] I encountered this issue while working on another PR, so I looked into this and filed a PR. Mind taking a look? Previously I can reproduce it every ~20+ runs or so, now it's more stable.
