Currently, ZooKeeper only takes snapshot based on the snap count. If the workload on an ensemble includes large txns then we'll end up with large amount data kept on disk, and might have a low disk space issue. 

Add a maximum limit on the total size of the log files between each snapshot. This will change the snap frequency, which means with the same snap retention number a server will eat up less disk.
