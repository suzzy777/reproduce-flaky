This is a work-in-progress patch because of the followings:
 * I only tested it in a downstream environment, it should be tested in a pseudo-distributed cluster as well.
 * It should be useful to modify a unit test which uses the MiniOozie.

Good catch!
I think we should use {{UserGroupInformationService}} here as well just like we do in [HadoopAccessorService|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/service/HadoopAccessorService.java].
{{createRemoteUser}} is used in the applications we're submitting to Yarn where we're only using the delegation tokens. This code runs in the Oozie server, we should use the 'oozie' user's proxyuser power.

It might worth to move the whole call to HadoopAccessorService (if you can find a good name for the function). I'll leave that call to you though.

I suggest using {{UserGroupInformationService.getProxyUser()}}. Oozie is already loggin in + authenticated at this point, so you don't have to mess around with the credentials - Oozie will be able to enter the target directory on behalf of the user.

I'd also add some extra comments describing why you're doing this.

Thanks for the reviews [~gezapeti] and [~pbacsko]. I have uploaded the next version of the patch. No unit test has been added, since I haven't found a good way to test it.

[~asalamon74] Why have you removed the line 
{noformat}
  setEnvironmentVariables(launcherJobConf, amContainer);
{noformat}
in the second patch?

[~gezapeti] The second patch also contains that line, it's in the doAs block.

Oh, sorry, I've missed that.
+1 then for patch-2

+1 LGTM

+1, committed to master

Closing issue; Oozie 5.2.0 is released
