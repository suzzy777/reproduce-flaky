    IGNITE-8456: Print warning if IGNITE_HOME & WORK and persistentStoreDir is not set, but persistence enabled

----


[~dpavlov], I've done with logging. Here is ["Basic" build|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1283846&]. Prepared solution doesn't affect the existing Ignite functionality and other tests. Could you please review the changes?

[~ivan.glukos] could you please take a look?

 

[~SomeFire] meanwhile could you please trigger Run All PDS instead of Basic. It has very limited coverage for Persistent Data Store functionality, so Run ALL PDS would be more relevant.

[~SomeFire], I've looked through your changes.
I think, current message is not informative enough. My suggestions:
1. Use actual value of java.io.tmpdir property in warning message instead of its name.
2. Except for setting IGNITE_HOME, it's possible to change location of persistence folders with data storage configuration (see DataStorageConfiguration#walPath, DataStorageConfiguration#walArchivePath, DataStorageConfiguration#storagePath properties). This option should be mentioned in warning message as well.

[~ivan.glukos], I made changes you suggested. Can you look again?

[~dpavlov], [PDS tests|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1285092&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAllPds] are finished.

Hi [~SomeFire], thank you, there is just one failure and it is flaky test, so TC can be considered as OK.

I suggest to slightly change the message to: "Persistence store directory is in the temp directory and may be cleaned. <rest of the message>" and move the actual directory location to the end of the message.

[~agoncharuk], I changed text as you suggested.

Thanks, merged to master.
