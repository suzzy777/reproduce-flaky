I started bisecting to find out where the test started to fail.

Bisect came back with this commit:

* eb6b617d92 - (refs/bisect/bad) HBASE-22810 Initialize an separate ThreadPoolExecutor for taking/restoring snapshot (#486) (8 days ago) <openinx>

Looks like already fixed, my bad.

The test is already fixed but the flaky dashboard was not yet reflecting this. Resolving as duplicate.
