We found that test_ctas could fail due to CTAS not being able to reach the expected states in 'wait_time' which is 20 seconds if the underlying file system is HDFS ([https://github.com/apache/impala/blame/master/tests/metadata/test_ddl.py#L1120C7-L1120C16]).

Maybe we could slightly increase 'wait_time' to make this test less flaky.
