Per https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_SQL/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/junit/org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.sql.meta.provider.kafka/KafkaTableProviderIT/history/?start=50 it looks like this has been flaking for quite a while.

Earliest I see is https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_SQL/6063/testReport/junit/org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.sql.meta.provider.kafka/KafkaTableProviderIT/testFake2_3_/, but that's pretty close to the oldest run we have right now (6058).

Could be related to [~dpcollins-google]'s recent changes there.

Also wanted to note we had this issue a few months ago that could be relevant: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-11456

FTR, this appears to be the failing line [https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/243128a8fc52798e1b58b0cf1a271d95ee7aa241/sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/meta/provider/kafka/KafkaTableProviderIT.java#L152]

I don't think its related to my changes: This just looks like an inherently racy test comparing two rate measurements.

Agreed that looks like a risky test. Your changes may be tangentially related, in BEAM-11456 I think the solution involved reducing test parallelism. So maybe adding new tests causes an issue? Regardless we should fix the root cause here. 

This seems to still be happening [https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_SQL/6135/] . It also appears that for some builds, this is just timing out the test suite (e.g. [https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_SQL/6136/)] 

This  seems to be more than a flaky test currently, as it's been consistently aborted since [https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_SQL/6136/] and failing since https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_SQL/6135/

This looks like a different issue, I filed BEAM-12146 for it, thanks Emily

Still happening? Who could look at this issue?

Still happening in https://ci-beam.apache.org/view/PostCommit/job/beam_PostCommit_SQL/6257/
{code:java}
java.lang.AssertionError: Timed out before subscription created for projects/apache-beam-testing/topics/integ-test-PubsubTableProviderIT-testSQLLimit2-2021-05-07-12-34-13-385-events--2497840622323978525{code}

That is actually a different failure mode thats been happening for a while (should be resolved on the next run): BEAM-12258

Ok, you are right, I thought it was the same tests.
