This test is very slow in ASAN builds, takes 2.5 hours usually. I took a look at the particular build and noticed that every test in TestParquetStats was around 2x slower than usual. That explains why this test hit the 4 hour limit. So it seems the test failed due to a slow machine.

Closing this since it was due to machine slowness. And it didn't occur in a while.
