Hi [~dionusos] ,

could you please check the unit test results?
Also, please use .toLowerCase() in your patch set

Thanks.

Thanks [~jmakai] .

I think the {{.toLowerCase()}} is not mandatory as the change utilises {{.equalsIgnoreCase()}}.

Regarding the test failures: I see tons of Connection Refused in HDFS communication. Locally I couldn't reproduce. Maybe it is some infra issue. I am restarting the check and will investigate if the rerun fails.
