I noticed that tests for dtest in upgrade_tests/thrift_upgrade_test.py are flaky.

The reason this flakiness happens is that we are stopping and starting a node too fast without waiting for its full initialisation and then next attempt to connect to rpc port fails and whole test fails.

The fix is rather easy, we just need to wait until it is full started.
