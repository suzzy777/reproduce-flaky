[~gezapeti] please review

[~dbist13] thanks for the contribution!

However, I don't like the possibility of having no Doclint checks at all. Wouldn't be a subset like [*{{-Xdoclint:html,syntax,accessibility}}*|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html#BEJEFABE] better? Even switching on for only {{public}} methods? All the relevant Doclint checks that still exists would be handled either here or in a follow-up JIRA.

{color:red}-1{color} Patch failed to apply to head of branch

----------------------------

[~dbist13] can you please rebase to current {{master}}?

[~andras.piros] thanks for review, I added your properties and the patch did not fix the apidoc error above. I agree that with my patch we lose a lot of visibility and better to address the original issue than hide everything. I am strapped for time now and cannot work on this but I will dig deeper into what is going on. I am attaching my patch with rebase just for continuity.

[~dbist13] thanks for the feedback. Waiting on your next patch, then.

[~andras.piros] experimenting with the flags convinced me that we should enable doclint:all and address the individual issues in the follow up jiras. The patch works for JDK7 and 8 but this being last subtask jira for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE-2969 maybe we can merge that and drop jdk7? I'll file jiras and try to address the reported issues by doclint in upcoming run.

[~dbist13] I'm happy to accomodate {{-Xdoclint:all}} in this JIRA. Thanks for the contribution!

Please open another subtask of OOZIE-2969 to track all the JDK8 Javadoc warnings. Talking to [~gezapeti] we would be really happy if all the Javadoc warnings would be solved in terms of this parent task. If you don't have time to work on that one, someone else might pick that up.
