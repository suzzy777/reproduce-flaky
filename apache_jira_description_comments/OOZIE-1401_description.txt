Currently, {{PurgeXCommand}} logic is not working with those workflow jobs with {{end_time=null}}. This command needs to take care of those jobs as well. This happens in the case of long stuck jobs after Hadoop restarts or DB failures. It could be done by checking {{last_modified_time}} instead, if {{end_time}} is not available.

The current query:
{code:sql}
select w from WorkflowJobBean w where w.endTimestamp < :endTime
{code}

There is also an issue when:
* there is a parent workflow that has its {{end_time}} set
* is otherwise eligible for {{PurgeXCommand}}: {{end_time}} is older than configured number of days, and has {{status}} either {{KILLED}}, or {{FAILED}}, or {{SUCCEEDED}}
* has a child workflow that has the {{parent_id}} set to the {{id}} of the parent workflow
* child workflow has its {{end_time = NULL}}

In this case, [*{{PurgeXCommand#fetchTerminatedWorkflow()}}*|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/command/PurgeXCommand.java#L249] throws a {{NullPointerException}} like this:
