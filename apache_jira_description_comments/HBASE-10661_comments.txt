Simple patch. Also gets rid of unused mock class.

Attaching a v2 patch, since we still see some failures after v1 patch. 

This patch adds another candidate generator which is trying to move away the regions which are co-located in the same rack. This will help with the test as well as the production cases because the LB is expected to converse sooner. 


Attaching v3 patch. v2 dropped some changes because of a mis-rebase on my part. v3 is v1 + v2. 

v4 patch with increased timeouts. I'll let it run a couple more days in our rig to see the results. 

v5 should be good enough to commit. We've been running the tests on multiple platforms, and the tests seems stable enough. 

[~devaraj] can you review the latest version as well. The tests have been more stable after this for some time. v6 should make it even more so.

Thanks Devaraj. I've committed this to branch. 

Attaching rebased patch for master that is committed
