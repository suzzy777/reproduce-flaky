Many of these tests write to the disk without using TemporaryFolder so you end up with RAT failures after running a test in an IDE unless you remember to search for the output from the test to delete it.

These tests also use HeadlessGfsh or TestableGfsh. Both are very buggy, eat exceptions, have strange timeouts and can cause flaky test failures.
