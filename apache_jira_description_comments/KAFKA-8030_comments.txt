I'll take a look

Failed again: [https://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/kafka-trunk-jdk11/detail/kafka-trunk-jdk11/376/tests]

One more: [https://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/kafka-trunk-jdk8/detail/kafka-trunk-jdk8/3471/tests]

Again: [https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk11-scala2.12/3279/testReport/junit/kafka.admin/TopicCommandWithAdminClientTest/testDescribeUnderMinIsrPartitionsMixed/]

Started working on this, now trying to reproduce. I don't exactly see why does it fail but I have the feeling that we have to wait for metadata propagation after killing the broker.

Update: couldn't reproduce the flakiness by simply running the tests. I really think that the issue here is the asynchronicity with Zookeeper so I'll make a PR tomorrow to eliminate this by waiting for topic metadata changes in alive brokers. The pattern that is used in testDescribeUnderMinIsrPartitionsMixed is present elsewhere and I have yet to eliminate one more trickier case.

Also: the STDERR output belongs to a different test ({{testCreateWithAssignmentAndPartitionCount}}) which tests if those argument combinations are not valid together.

   This change adds waits for metadata updates after killing the broker in order to make the tests more stable.

[https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk11-scala2.12/4111/testReport/junit/kafka.admin/TopicCommandWithAdminClientTest/testDescribeUnderMinIsrPartitionsMixed/]

I think I managed to reproduce it, or at least something like it. Running it for more than 17 hours the 204th iteration failed.

Managed to reproduce a failure again with logs. Now it's better, just 1 hour and 100 something iterations :D.

Attached the info level logs. Will look into it later this week.

Since there were no further reports I take it as my PR fixed the problem. I'm closing this jira but please reopen if any flakiness reoccurs.
