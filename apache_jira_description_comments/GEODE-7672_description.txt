Clear operations are successfully updates the OQL indexes

 

Acceptance :
 * Passing Dunit tests where OQL queries using indexes return correct results after the region is cleared
 * clear operation and index updates are successful when clear operation is executed when the puts are occurring which are trying to update the OQL index.
 * Unit tests to ensure that index sizes are zero after the region is cleaned
 * Test coverage to when a member departs in this scenario
 * Test coverage to when a member restarts in this scenario
 * Unit tests with complete code coverage for the newly written code.
