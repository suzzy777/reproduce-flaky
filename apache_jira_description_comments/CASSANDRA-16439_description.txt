Building on CASSANDRA-16398, for users upgrading from 3.0 to 4.0 there have been a few new reserved keywords added that can cause problems with schema changes and queries in existing applications. Reducing the number of new reserved words makes upgrades easier for users.

{code:java}
K_DEFAULT
K_MBEAN
K_MBEANS
K_NEGATIVE_INFINITY
K_NEGATIVE_NAN
K_POSITIVE_INFINITY
K_POSITIVE_NAN
K_REPLACE
K_SCHEMA
K_UNSET
{code}

I think they can all be removed from the ReservedWords lists (where present) and added to {{basic_unreserved_keyword}} with the exception of the {\{NAN}} and \{{INFINITY}} as there could be ambiguity between a selected field and a nan/infinity literal.

To validate I've written a test that extracts the keywords from the parser tokens and verifies that any non-reserved keywords can be used as table and column names for regular tables and materialized views. It isn't exhaustive but provides a good sense check.
