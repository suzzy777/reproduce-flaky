New AssignmentManager implemented using proc-v2.
 - AssignProcedure handle assignment operation
 - UnassignProcedure handle unassign operation
 - MoveRegionProcedure handle move/balance operation

Concurrent Assign operations are batched together and sent to the balancer
Concurrent Assign and Unassign operation ready to be sent to the RS are batched together

This patch is an intermediate state where we add the new AM as AssignmentManager2() to the master, to be reached by tests. but the new AM will not be integrated with the rest of the system. Only new am unit-tests will exercise the new assigment manager. The integration with the master code is part of HBASE-14616
