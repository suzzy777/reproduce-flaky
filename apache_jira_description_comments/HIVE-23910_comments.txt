I ended up ignoring all the external_jdbc* tests because 3 more have failed:

http://ci.hive.apache.org/job/hive-precommit/job/master/116/testReport/
http://ci.hive.apache.org/job/hive-precommit/job/master/139/testReport/

I suspect this issue has to do with the tmp directory getting wiped. I am changing the clashing folders in HIVE-24143. I'd like to have the jdbc-based tests enabled so I will keep an eye to make sure they are not flaky anymore.
