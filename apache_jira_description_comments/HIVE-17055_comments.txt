[~kgyrtkirk] Can we run bisect on this to figure out what commit broke this?

[~sershe] [~djaiswal] Any idea if this change is expected?

Stats have been known to be flaky.

The original description has result changes which is more alarming. I will reassign it to myself for investigation.

bisect was not able to get the bottom of it...the stat in this case seems to be undeterministic...
running the same revision a few times: 3/5 cases the difference have happened..
I don't think stats should be changing at all between executions....they should be calculated in a stable manner.. which means the end result should be the same


I have seen it happen in many tests not just this one. The flaky stats seems like an independent issue.

There are three tests which are failing due to flaky stats as mentioned in description. Common theme among all of them are that they are SMB tests.

TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver.testCliDriver[smb_cache] is in same category too. Infrequently fails with stats change.

Patch for this is part of HIVE-19195

Pushed to master as part of HIVE-19195 patch.

Reopening. All three tests are still failing on branch-3:
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/10359/testReport/

[~ashutoshc] [~vgarg] can you please review?

I removed llap_smb and tez_join_hash from cli driver and some other minor cleanups there.

[~djaiswal] You'll need to move corresponding output files to llap dir as well.
Also {{llap_nullscan.q}}, {{dynamic_partition_pruning_2.q}} and {{tez_union_dynamic_partition.q}} are removed from minillap.shared but are not added under any group does that mean these tests are being moved to cli only?
Also will this patch fix the flakyness in llap_smb?

[~vgarg] these tests were already in llap only list so they never ran in MR anyway. I will update the patch with removed result files.

I was too hasty to comment. The files were removed already. It is just a cleanup.

I think we are set for these tests.

+1. Looks like llap_smb and tez_join_hash was running for TestCli only so we don't know yet if these test are fixed for TestLlapCli. Lets hope this fixes it.

pushed to master.

Keeping it open as tez_smb_1 still fails.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12920066 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build

{{TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver.testCliDriver[tez_smb_1]}} is failing on master and branch-3 but with different symptoms
master has plan change https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/10413/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli/TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver/testCliDriver_tez_smb_1_/

branch-3 has difference in stats: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/10410/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli/TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver/testCliDriver_tez_smb_1_/


tez_smb_main is consistently failing (both on master and branch-3). Probably need golden file output. [~djaiswal] Would you mind taking a look?

tez_smb_1 is failing with plan difference on branch-3 (https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/10541/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli/TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver/testCliDriver_tez_smb_1_/). I don't see it failing on master though
