As the license issue, isn't forcing the issue right now, I'd like to change this to a general discussion of the future of hedwig. Almost all the comments about the c++ client apply to hedwig as a whole. Hedwig has only had 5 real changes in the last year, only one in 2014. For all intensive purposes, it is inactive, unmaintained and unsupported. AFAIK, noone is using it in production in anything close to the form of the apache codebase.

However, by having it in the codebase, at the same level of bookkeeper-server, we are indicating to users that it is in fact supported software and considered as important as bookkeeper-server. So, I would like to propose that, after the 4.3.0 release, we remove hedwig from the codebase. Obviously, it will still be available in the git/svn history, and in all releases <= 4.3.0.

-The hedwig c++ client has not had any real code change since november 2012. It is not built as part of the main build. It is not tested as part of the main build. It is effectively unmaintained.-

-In addition to this, it contains m4 files whose license status is unclear.-

-I propose we simple remove it from trunk and branch-4.2. The license issue is currently blocking the release of 4.2.3. [~jiannan], [~farrellee], you were the last people to submit anything for the client. Are you using in production? Any objection to its removal from the main code tree?-
