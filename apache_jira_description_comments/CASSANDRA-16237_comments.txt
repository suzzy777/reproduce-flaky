[~maedhroz], [~adelapena], would either of you be able to look into this?  There may be a leak so unable to cleanup... a common work around is to split the class into multiple classes.

[~adelapena] I'm going to take a shot at splitting this up. I'll probably be asking for your review soon...

Good, I'll be happy to review.

[patch|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/815] [CircleCI j8 with upgrade tests|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/maedhroz/cassandra/146/workflows/5867ebbf-0c04-4fb9-b049-dd0184575782]

The patch has survived two runs of in-JVM upgrade tests in ci-cassandra too:

https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/all/job/Cassandra-devbranch-jvm-dtest-upgrade/66/
https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/all/job/Cassandra-devbranch-jvm-dtest-upgrade/67/

Second CircleCI run here: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/maedhroz/cassandra/146/workflows/8e6ad0d8-b432-4874-bf31-a10892be7288

All four CI rounds have succeeded. Changes look good to me.

+1

The patch is a clean refactor and should speed up CI runs; though sad we need this refactor =/

I did leave a few comments about COMPACT STORAGE, but since this patch isn't dealing with that I think its fine to punt to the patch adding COMPACT STORAGE back (CASSANDRA-16217 [~ifesdjeen]).

bq. Changes look good to me

[~adelapena] if this is your +1 then I can start the commit.

[~dcapwell]Â that is my +1.

CI Results: Yellow; known issues, and `org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.RepairTest` which had a timeout (calling this as unrelated)
