[~mikesbrown] - giving this to you because I know you were working on proper test fixtures to deal with database state.

This is a real flaky test bug that can be exercised if you run {{impala-py.test}} in such a way as to trigger the tests. However, it doesn't occur in our current Jenkins-run tests because of how we've crafted {{bin/run-all-tests.sh}}: UDFs aren't persistent, so the UDFs go away in subsequent runs.

The cleanest way to fix this problem is to use the fix for IMPALA-2537 which isn't 2.5.0-critical. Since this isn't breaking builds I'm moving this to 2.6.0, also.

Quick way to trigger bug:

{noformat}
impala-py.test -m "execute_serially" --workload_exploration_strategy functional-query:exhaustive \
-k test_functions_ddl metadata/test_ddl.py 

impala-py.test -n4 -m "not execute_serially" --workload_exploration_strategy functional-query:exhaustive \
-k test_udf_update_via_create query_test/test_udfs.py
{noformat}

Quick way to show {{run-all-tests}} won't make the problem happen:

{code}
FE_TEST=false BE_TEST=false JDBC_TEST=false CLUSTER_TEST=false \
EE_TEST_FILES="-k 'test_udf_update_via_create or test_functions_ddl' query_test/test_udfs.py metadata/test_ddl.py" \
bin/run-all-tests.sh -e exhaustive -n 2
{code}

    IMPALA-2650: UDF EE tests: use unique databases in some tests
    
    Some of the end-to-end tests in query_test/test_udfs.py create UDFs in
    the default database and leave them there. Other tests (e.g.,
    test_functions_ddl) polling the default database and expecting to find
    no UDFs will fail. It turns out this wouldn't happen in our Jenkins
    builds (see IMPALA-2650 for more details as to why), but it manifests
    itself with repeated impala-py.test runs in specific order.
    
    The fix is to create the UDFs in databases unique to the test cases.
    This leaves the default database pristine during these tests.
    
    Testing:
    
    Before, the following sequence of impala-py.test commands would cause
    any subsequent runs of test_functions_ddl to fail:
    
    $ # simulate a subset of serial tests that expect default DB not to have UDFs
    $ impala-py.test -m "execute_serially" --workload_exploration_strategy \
        functional-query:exhaustive -k test_functions_ddl metadata/test_ddl.py
    PASS
    $ # simulate a subset of parallel tests that create UDFs in default DB
    $ impala-py.test -n4 -m "not execute_serially" --workload_exploration_strategy \
        functional-query:exhaustive query_test/test_udfs.py
    PASS
    $ # rerun a subset of serial tests that passed before
    $ impala-py.test -m "execute_serially" --workload_exploration_strategy \
        functional-query:exhaustive -k test_functions_ddl metadata/test_ddl.py
    FAIL, because test_udfs left UDFs.
    
    Now, I can run these over and over, and they pass.
