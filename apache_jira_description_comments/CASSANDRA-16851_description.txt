Given that Jackson 2.9 support has ended, it would be good to move at least to the next minor version (2.10, patch 2.10.5) or later â€“ latest stable being 2.12.4.
 I can test to see if anything breaks, but looking at existing Jackson usage there shouldn't be many issues.

Assuming upgrade is acceptable there's the question of which branches to apply it to; I will first test it against 4.0.
