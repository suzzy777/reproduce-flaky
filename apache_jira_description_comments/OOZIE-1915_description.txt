There are few properties like {{oozie.instance.id}}, {{oozie.http.hostname}}, {{oozie.http.port}} which need to be configured as system property (-D).
This are mostly used for HA.

Let's have only one way of configuration, through oozie-default/oozie-site.
It will avoid confusion and ease deployment.
