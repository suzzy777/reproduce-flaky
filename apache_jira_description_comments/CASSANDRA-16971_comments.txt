Similar to CASSANDRA-15685, IR and Preview repair can't run concurrently.  

Hey [~marcuse], may I ask you for a quick sanity check, please? I believe you added these tests some time ago. 

While I can't reproduce the mentioned issue neither locally, nor in the CircleCI multiplexer, I am fairly confident that we just need to add similar to CASSANDRA-15685 *Thread.sleep(1000)* after [this assert|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/test/distributed/org/apache/cassandra/distributed/test/OptimiseStreamsRepairTest.java#L184] which does not guarantee that the job has completed. This should be enough to clear the flakiness and the Jenkins noise.

I think we can also add *Thread.sleep(1000)*  [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/test/distributed/org/apache/cassandra/distributed/test/OptimiseStreamsRepairTest.java#L91] to prevent also _testBasic()_ from being flaky. If you agree, I can take care to commit a quick patch for 4.0 and trunk where the tests exist.

 

 

https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commits/marcuse/16971 fixes this by checking the logs to make sure the previous repair is fully finished before starting the next one

Thanks [~marcuse]

+1, I also pushed it to trunk and tested [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1125/workflows/fa67f6e4-7da0-46ca-9e48-ae5cb4ce262d], just to be sure there are no weird surprises later :) 

committed, thanks!
