   - Timeout occurred due to initial slow rebalancing.
   - Added code to wait until `KafkaStreams` instance is in state RUNNING to check registration of 
     metrics and in state NOT_RUNNING to check deregistration of metrics.
   - I removed all other wait conditions, because they are not needed if `KafkaStreams` instance is in the
     right state.

Added a wait condition on the state of the Kafka client that waits until the state is RUNNING. If the Kafka client reaches state RUNNING, there should not be flakiness anymore. If it still fails, it is definitely an issue in the transition to RUNNING and not a metric registration issue.
