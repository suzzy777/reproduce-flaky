In HIVE-13090 we decided that we should not close the metastore if there is an unexpected exception during the expired token removal process, but that fix leaves a running metastore without ExpiredTokenRemover thread.

To fix this I will move the catch inside the running loop, and hope the thread could recover from the exception
