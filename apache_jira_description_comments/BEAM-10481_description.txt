 

I am running in an beam application in streaming mode with jobName and checkPointDir configured. When I recover application from a planned stop, I am getting failure.

 

I did some investigation and noticed that the accumulator is not getting registered on recovering checkpoint scenario.

 

Correct me if I am wrong. If you see the code in the screenshot below from MetricsAccumulator class on beam v2.22.0, you can see new instance of MetricsContainerStepMapAccumulator is getting registered on line#64. But if a recovered value is present, it constructs a new instance with the recovered value (Line#78). But this new accumulator instance is not getting registered. This is forcing Spark Driver to throw exception:  _java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Accumulator must be registered before send to executor_
