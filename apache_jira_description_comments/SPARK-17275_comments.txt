cc [~felixcheung] [~shivaram]

I dont think anything changed there recently. The error seems to be coming from IvyTestUtils deleting a directory -- [~brkyvz] Any ideas when this error can happen ?

is this still a problem?

I believe I am a regular reader of build logs but I think I have not seen this recently ...
How about simply ignoring the deletion failure? It looks the {{assert}} itself passed fine, [~shivaram] and [~felixcheung].

perhaps we should close this? it's been a year...

Let me resolve this for now but I will keep my eyes on builds and will reopen this and submit a PR to ignore the deletion failure if this could be observed even once in the future.
