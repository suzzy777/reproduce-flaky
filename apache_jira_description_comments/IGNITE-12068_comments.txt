[~JerryKwan], you faced (for our shame) a bug related to an optimization for a primary key equality lookup. Erroneously it assumes that there should be only one result row. As a workaround I was able to get proper results using filtering condition {{WHERE id >= 1 and id < 2}}. But it is really weird, hope to fix it shortly.

Hi [~Pavlukhin], thank for looking into this.
If the primary key is single, it must be only exists one result row, but if the primary key is composite, it depends
If the primary key is an interger, we can use the filtering conditionÂ WHERE id >= 1 and id < 2 as a temporary solution, but what should we do if it is an string?

[~JerryKwan], yep you are right. And a workaround for integers also does not look good. Currently I can only think about changing a table structure =(

Raising to a blocker. Let's make it to 2.7.6.

Work note. Release notes will be needed.

[~dmagda], What's the ETA of version of 2.7.6?

*Release notes*
Fixed a bug when SELECT with an equality predicate on a part of a complex primary key returned a single row result while multiple matching rows existed in the table.

[~Pavlukhin], the patch is good. Let's merge it.

Merged to master.

[~JerryKwan] should be available in the first weeks of September. See this thread for more details: http://apache-ignite-developers.2346864.n4.nabble.com/Apache-Ignite-2-7-6-Time-Scope-and-Release-manager-td42944.html

C++ and .NET test results are same as in 2.7.6. MVCC Queries tests are not stable, results are comparable to other 2.7.6 runs.

Cherry-picked to master in https://github.com/apache/ignite/commit/45d719e66c95df8a115af467792f8b89dace83e3

[~Pavlukhin] thank you for preparing release notes. I was thinking about how to describe the issue, but you've already shared it.
