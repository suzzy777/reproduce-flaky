Phoenix MR over snapshots uses TableSnapshotResultIterator and SnapshotScanner classes for iterating/scanning over snapshots. They had been copied over from HBase classes TableSnapshotScanner and ClientSideRegionScanner classes and modified according to Phoenix requirements. This decision was taken since some of fields of these classes were private and hence it is not possible to reuse them. HBASE-8369 is the main Jira.

The framework had a bug which was fixed as part of HBASE-16011. However the fix was not ported to Phoenix and hence Phoenix MR over snapshots still continues to have it. This Jira is to fix that issue.
