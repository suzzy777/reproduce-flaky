It fails here:
{code}
            // See that index is rebuilt and confirm index has rows
            Table htable= queryServices.getTable(Bytes.toBytes(viewIndexTableName));
            count = getUtility().countRows(htable);
            assertEquals(numOfValues, count);
{code}

numOfValues is set to 1 for this test. I'd suggest we set it to 100 or 1000 to see of the entire batch fails or just some rows.

Just this. That'll give us more clues hopefully.

Fails in other branches too.

Going to push this change out to gather some intel. If it continues to fail I'll disable.

Sorry pushed with a bad comment (forgot to mention the test name) force pushed - did it within a minute or so and checked that there were no other commits) - an amended commit message (other than master where I'm not allowed to).

So it's the entire batch failing. Let's disable.

I'm going to disable the test.

[~apurtell], [~kozdemir], [~gjacoby], [~tdsilva], this - and SaltedIndexIT.testMutableTableIndexMaintanenceSaltedSalted - are things we should look at before we release 4.15.0 and 5.1.0, I likely won't have time.

[~gjacoby], this is the flapping (but important) test we talked about. Disabled for now, but this seems really important,

[~giskender], could you please take a look at this?

[~giskender] will you be able to have a look. I disabled the test, but this is potentially a rather serious issue.

I'm not sure if this related or not. But from what I can see there 3 instances of:
{code:java}
conn.createStatement().execute("DELETE " + " FROM " + PhoenixDatabaseMetaData.SYSTEM_TASK_NAME);
{code}
in
{code:java}
org.apache.phoenix.end2end.DropTableWithViewsIT#testDropTableWithChildViews
org.apache.phoenix.end2end.IndexRebuildTaskIT#testIndexRebuildTask
org.apache.phoenix.end2end.index.IndexMetadataIT#testAsyncRebuildAll{code}
This couldn't be thread safe, right? 
 In addition to that I see 
{code:java}
org.apache.phoenix.end2end.index.IndexMetadataIT#testAsyncRebuildAll
{code}
is also flaky which suggest it has to do something with the delete statement, See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Phoenix-master/2436/testReport/junit/org.apache.phoenix.end2end.index/IndexMetadataIT/testAsyncRebuildAll/]

What are the intents behind the delete statement above, is this to delete all the task so this test can run faster?

 

This looks like an excellent find!

[~giskender] ping. Looks like an important issue. FYI [~gjacoby] [~kozdemir] [~swaroopa]

[~ckulkarni] sorry I was on vacation. Just got back. Will work on it today.

[~m2je], I don't think the root cause is the DELETEs. If that was the case, the waitForTaskState would throw an exception "Ran out of time waiting for task state to become .." since the task table was empty. It must have find a complete task there to get to this statement. 

I am adding a check that the task it checks for Complete status is a relevant task. If there is a COMPLETE task but for another table, we return from waitForTaskState even though the task that we are interested in is not complete yet.

 

Please take a look : [https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/550] [~lhofhansl] [~ckulkarni] [~gjacoby]

Ping [~giskender] can you please update your patch as per the review comments on your PR?

Thanks for working on this [~giskender].

The change has become fairly big. Not a problem as such, just wondering if there's a more minimalistic fix. The core of the fix seems to be adding WHERE <tablename> = ... and to passing down the table name through the call stack.

As I said not a problem... Just asking. :)


[~lhofhansl], while I was working on this patch, I realized that we have some bugs in the code itself. One of the bugs is we did not take into account where a table name and index name and task type can be same but timestamp is different. Originally the code was picking just the first task (that task could be completed but there might be another task with a newer timestamp which is running). I found that issue while looking at Chinmay's comments. This fix also queries with timestamp to eliminate the scenario I described.

The second thing I addressed was this issue: In the test, I was disabling index table and truncating it. Index tool returns success but no rows get populated. The reason for that is, phoenix is not aware of hbase's disable and thinks that the index table did not change.

I hope this explains a bit why it got bigger.

It does. Thank you.

Thanks for the patch [~giskender]. Checked the Jenkins build (though it failed to attach comments to the JIRA) and it looks like the test failures are unrelated to your changes. Committed to master and 4.x branches.

Yeah!
{quote}looks like the test failures are unrelated to your changes
{quote}
That's no longer an excuse. The tests should pass. Always. Period. If not that needs to be fixed - and not by me again :)
 (Although, since we then got successful runs, it's fine in this case).
