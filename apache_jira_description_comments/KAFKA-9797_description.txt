TestSecurityRollingUpgrade.test_enable_separate_interbroker_listener is supposed to test non-disruptive upgrade of inter-broker listener using rolling bounce. But the test updates inter-broker listener without enabling the new listener/security_protocol across all brokers, making this a disruptive upgrade where brokers are in inconsistent state until all brokers have been upgraded. The test must first enable the new listener across all brokers and then update the inter-broker listener to the new listener to ensure that the cluster is functioning during the upgrade.
