It would be also great if we could disable the test case until we have a resolution.

Just guessing here that the issue originates from https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/js/test/unit/generated-data-tests.ts#L57 since I'm unable to reproduce it locally and the error trace doesn't contain the test case.

Disabled the test for the 7.0.0 release via https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/f1729a58a8222a18e0f1afc1b6fcf25efb2432aa

Postponing to 9.0
