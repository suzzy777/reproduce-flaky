We cannot convert website tests to run within Docker until the necessary Jenkins plugin is installed by Apache Infra.

I've managed to run a local Jenkins in a docker container (using [~Ardagan]'s dockerized-jenkins).
I managed to set it up so that Jenkins has authorization to launch Docker jobs on the host Docker.
Right now, it's managed to start the ruby:2.5 image, but it doesn't have access to /tmp on the Jenkins containers:

  /bin/sh: 0: Can't open /tmp/jenkins6814128182425397587.sh 

Current incomplete state: https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/6fb3248792a4c8a9c10868df222b8301a13a3286

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/6282 is out for review, which implements pre-commits in docker containers.
