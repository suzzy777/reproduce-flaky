The same flaky behaviour on {{pyignite}}. Enabling TLS 1.3 on python 3.9 causes the same behaviour on security tests.


I've got to the roots of the issue, and this seems to be a server-side issue. In short, in TLS 1.3 unlike in TLS 1.2 client considers handshake complete when server has not yet complete configuring ciphers. This may cause (and causes) situations, when client send application layer data to server alongside with ChangeCipherSpec message. But on the server side we do not consider this possibility and do not process application layer data after handling ChangeCipherSpec (which is considered to be a part of handshake process). So even though receive buffer is not empty, we simply do not check and process any data left in it after handshake is complete.

P.S. Changing ticket summary accordingly and adding patch.

The issue was reproduced by adding delays in specific places and stopped appearing with this fix. Still, I'm not sure how to implement a proper test for this case.
