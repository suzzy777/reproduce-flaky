Recently two query retries test have been failing:
h4. TestQueryRetries.test_retry_query_result_cacheing_failed
 * The symptom was that the test cluster did not start in time, so the test timed out.

h4. TestQueryRetries.test_multiple_retries
 * Failed with the following stack trace:
{code:none}
custom_cluster/test_query_retries.py:471: in test_multiple_retries
