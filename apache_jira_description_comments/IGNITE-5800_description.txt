*Goal*
To allow community to grow more quickly and from the CI perspective, failing tests should be the main concern

For Run All dependencies at Ignite 20 Tests
http://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=Ignite20Tests&branch_Ignite20Tests=%3Cdefault%3E
there should be no stable red suites. timed out suites and stable red tests.

*Priorities*
Following priorities are suggested for issues
- Test suite timeout - it hides real test failures from us and wastes agent time
- Stable failing test - 50-100% of failures - issue is to be created as blocked to the next release, test should be muted.
- Flaky tests 1%-50% of failures, which are considered by teamcity as flaky may be not muted for now because TC interface helps us to identify these tests.

*Scope*
TBD by JIRA queries
Failures not muted
