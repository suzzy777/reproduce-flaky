the only test that  failed for the nightly build was "arrow-dataset-dataset-test" on Ubuntu
https://github.com/ursacomputing/crossbow/runs/2756067135#step:6:2888

the exact error is
{code:bash}
/arrow/cpp/build-support/run-test.sh: line 88: 11425 Segmentation fault
{code}

all the tests passed on OS X for the same nightly (java-jars)
