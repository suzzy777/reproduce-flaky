IMPALA-8409: Fix row-size for STRING columns with unknown stats

Explain returned row-size=11B for STRING columns without statistics.
The issue was caused by adding -1 (meaning unknown) to the 12 byte
slot size (sizeof(StringValue)). The code in TupleDescriptor.java
tried to handle this by checking if the size is -1, but it was
already 11 at this point.

There is more potential for cleanup, but I wanted to keep this
change minimal.

Testing:
- revived some tests in CatalogTest.java that were removed
  in 2013 due to flakiness
- added an EE test that checks row size with and without stats
- fixed a similar test, test_explain_validate_cardinality_estimates
  (the format of the line it looks for has changed, which lead to
  skipping the actual verification and accepting everything)
- ran core FE and EE tests
