[~taylor-codes-01] thanks for the patch, you can find more info about the precommit error here: [https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/PreCommit-OOZIE-Build/16/] I think you don't need the oozie directory here:
{noformat}
diff --git b/oozie/src/main/assemblies/distro.xml a/oozie/src/main/assemblies/distro.xml {noformat}

Fixed file path!

[~asalamon74] – I see the second patch failed. I will re-submit pointing at 5.2.0 

Pointing @ 5.2.0

Precommit will apply it on top of the master branch, so you need to create a patch which can be applied there.

[~asalamon74] – Thank you! I am sure the patch applies to the master branch. It's possible I am using diff incorrectly. I will try once more.

Trying a new git diff!

I think the problem is caused by the DOS line endings. [~taylor-codes-01] can you try to create a patch file with unix line endings.

Applied Unix line-endings!

[~asalamon74] – I verified the line-endings are in Unix format. The build fails with _"__corrupt patch at line 27"_ (which is the end of the file). Is there something I am missing?
