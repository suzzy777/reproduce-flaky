This ticket aims at sorting output rows in SQLQueryTestSuite even if a given plan has a `Sort` node. In that case, the current logic skips sorting output rows (see the code below for details):
https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0494dc90af48ce7da0625485a4dc6917a244d580/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SQLQueryTestSuite.scala#L503-L522

But, I think we still need to sort output rows if the node just sort output rows by partial columns (instead of all columns). The current logic can lead to a flaky test behaviour.
