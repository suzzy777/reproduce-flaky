This ticket aims at filtering out TPCDS v1.4 q6 and q75 in `TPCDSQueryTestSuite`.

I saw`TPCDSQueryTestSuite` failed nondeterministically because output row orders were different with those in the golden files. For example, the failure in the GA job, https://github.com/linhongliu-db/spark/runs/2507928605?check_suite_focus=true, happened because the `tpcds/q6.sql` query output rows were only sorted by `cnt`:

Actually, `tpcds/q6.sql` and `tpcds-v2.7.0/q6.sql` are almost the same and the only difference is that `tpcds-v2.7.0/q6.sql` sorts both `cnt` and `a.ca_state`:
https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a0c76a8755a148e2bd774edcda12fe20f2f38c75/sql/core/src/test/resources/tpcds-v2.7.0/q6.sql#L22
So, I think it's okay just to test `tpcds-v2.7.0/q6.sql` in this case (q75 has the same issue).
