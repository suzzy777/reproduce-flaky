Hi all,

 

There is a feature that allows to rerun failing tests: [https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/rerun-failing-tests.html]

This feature outputs to the surefire XML report some elements like flakyFailure, flakyError, and others.

 

However, when generating the surefire report (invoking something like mvn surefire-report:report-only) those XML elements are not used and are not considered for the HTML report. That would be a great improvement.

 

I can try to make a pull request for that, but please give me an overview first on where to look at to try to cut some time and some effort.
