After some digging in it appears that a second firing occurs (though only one is expected) but it doesn't come from a stale state (state is empty before it fires).
Might be a retry happening for some reason, which is OK in terms of fault-tolerance guarantees (at-least-once), but not so much in terms of flaky tests. 

I'm looking into this hoping to fix this ASAP.
