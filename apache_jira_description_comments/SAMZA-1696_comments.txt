    SAMZA-1696: Fix TestKeyValueStores flaky test

    Fix flaky test testParallelReadWriteSameKey that was failing due to a race condition between the main test thread and the thread manipulating the key value store under test. Specifically, the main test thread could assert the store has received a value before the other thread gets to set it. The hard-coded wait durations did not guarantee the main test thread would wait for all other threads to complete, causing it to assert prematurely.

We decided to delete the flaky test since the underlying RocksDB store wrapped within RocksDbKeyValueStore is thread-safe by design, which renders the test in question redundant and unnecessary.
