[~tarmstrong] Like we discussed earlier, this test has inherent flakiness which we tried to fix in IMPALA-9830. I think adding test specific code to control the uncertainty (adding some sort of determinism while instances fetch scan ranges) might be an overkill and correctness of the results is already being taken care of by other tests. Might be worth to just remove this test. What do you think?

I'm OK with removing it

IMPALA-10037: Remove flaky test_mt_dop_scan_node

This test has inherent flakiness due to it relying on instances
fetching scan ranges from a shared queue. Therefore, this patch
removes the test since it was just a sanity check but its flakiness
outweighed its usefulness.
