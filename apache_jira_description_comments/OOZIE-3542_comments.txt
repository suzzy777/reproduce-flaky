Thank you [~zsombor] for the fix.

I would have two small comments related your patch:
 * Please rename the test class to TestECPolicyDisabler.java
 * Please mark somewhere in the name of SystemErasureCodingPolicies that is created for tested purposes, so when we are doing class search to know it even without opening it. (for example I would rename it to SystemErasureCodingPoliciesForTest)

 

Thanks [~kmarton] for your comments. [~zsombor] if you do not mind I've uploaded the requested changes.

Thanks [~dionusos]! LGTM, +1, let's wait for the pending Jenkins and I will merge the change.

[~dionusos], I yesterday [~zsombor] mentioned offline that the {{SystemErasureCodingPolicies}} is called using reflection, so is not a good idea to rename it. I think that the test failures are caused by this rename.
Sorry for the confusion. 

Sorry, I wasn't near to a laptop. I've renamed the test class in patch #4, but the SystemErasureCodingPolicies unfortunately called from ECPolicyDisabler with reflection - so it's not obvious that you couldn't change it. When Oozie could depend on Hadoop 3 directly, the mocking could be much simpler

[~zsombor], can you please share what was the problem with the initial patch?

Yes, the problem was, that the there are multiple reflective calls to the remote HDFS service, where the same error could happen - and unfortunately only one call is handled previously. The new patch adds the same checks to all calls.  

Thank you [~zsombor] for the clarification! The fix looks good to me. Can you please extend the test with the scenarios when the other two methods are not supported? As you did for getErasureCodingPolicy method in {{testServerNotSupportsGetErasureCodingPolicyMethod()}}

Sorry, I forgot this ticket. I've added a new patch, but due to limitation in mocking - we can't mock a final class, in this case enum - I had to write a hand-made fake enum for the tests.

 Unfortunately, I don't understand, what's the problem with the PreCommit build 

Commit 9620d5174da89ffbc24335188c2ba06c80bf9da8 in oozie's branch refs/heads/master from Kinga Marton
[ https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=oozie.git;h=9620d51 ]

OOZIE-3542 amend Handle better old Hdfs implementations in ECPolicyDisabler (zsombor via kmarton)


Thank you [~zsombor] for the fix! 

Unfortunately the Spotbugs check is broken. The reported issues are unrelated.

+1, committed to master

Closing issue; Oozie 5.2.0 is released
