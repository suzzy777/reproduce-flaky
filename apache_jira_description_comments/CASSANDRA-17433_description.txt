PEP 615 – Support for the IANA Time Zone Database in the Standard Library class ZoneInfo

PEP 615 (Python 3.9) has obsoleted the 3rd party Olsen tz library 'pytz' with support for the IANA Time Zone Database.  The code which imports this in cqlshmain.py and tests in [test_cqlsh_output.py|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1493/files/9c658a20c669d11a54ecc6b42ba083da13de0103#diff-f5a3955faadf50a1292df481044b83cefc44b2dac46676022c80bad076491a50] should be updated accordingly.

    try:

        import zoneinfo

else:

    try:

        import pytz

        ...
