test_query_profile_thrift_timestamps seems to have started failing due to the debug profile not becoming available in the expected time limit (60 seconds). This started happening around the time the Meltdown bug patches were applied by AWS, so it could possibly be related.

 

A fix could be to just increase the expected time limit.
