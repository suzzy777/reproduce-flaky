TestSecurity has the following TODO:
{code}
    // TODO(todd): it seems that exportAuthenticationCredentials() doesn't properly retry
    // in the case that there is no leader, even though NoLeaderFoundException is a RecoverableException.
    // So, we have to use a hack of calling listTabletServers, which _does_ properly retry,
    // in order to wait for the masters to elect a leader.
{code}
It seems like this causes occasional failures of tests like KuduRDDTest -- I saw a case where the client failed to connect due to a negotiation timeout, and then didn't retry at all. It's not clear why the 3-second negotiation timeout was insufficient in this test case but likely just machine load or somesuch.
