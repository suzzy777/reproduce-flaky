Failed again at a different point:
h3. Stacktrace

java.lang.AssertionError: Expected: is <true> but: was <false> at org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(MatcherAssert.java:20) at org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(MatcherAssert.java:6) at org.apache.kafka.streams.integration.OptimizedKTableIntegrationTest.shouldApplyUpdatesToStandbyStore(OptimizedKTableIntegrationTest.java:159)

Unfortunately this just failed again, at a different place:
h3. Stacktrace

java.lang.AssertionError: Expected: is <true>

but: was <false>

at org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(MatcherAssert.java:6)

at org.apache.kafka.streams.integration.OptimizedKTableIntegrationTest.shouldApplyUpdatesToStandbyStore(OptimizedKTableIntegrationTest.java:150)

I don't have thought on fixing the errors. See if anyone wants to investigate it. Thanks.

I took a look at all the current Jenkins PR builds to search for this flaky test, and the test hasn't showed any flakiness for the last 2 months. Only one PR (PR-9732) has this test case failing, but it is related to something completely different, which might have been caused by the PR because it has other test cases failing too.

 

I will close this Jira for now. Please re-open it again if it fails with the same issue. Add the link to the PR to investigate the logs.
