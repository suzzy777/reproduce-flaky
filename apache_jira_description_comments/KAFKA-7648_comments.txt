Currently TestUtils.createTopic(...) will re-send znode creation request to zookeeper service if the previous response shows Code.CONNECTIONLOSS. See KafkaZkClient.retryRequestsUntilConnected() for related logic.

This means that the test will fail if the zookeeper has created znode upon the first request, the response to the first request is lost or timed-out, the second request is sent, and the response of the second request shows Code.NODEEXISTS.

In order to fix this flaky test, we probably should implement some logic similar to KafkaZkClient.CheckedEphemeral() to check whether the znode has been created in the with the same session id after receiving Code.NODEEXISTS.

Given the above understanding and the fact that the test passes with high probability, this flaky test does not indicate bug and should not be a blocking issue for 2.1.0 release.
