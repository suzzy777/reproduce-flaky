{{org.apache.cassandra.cql3.validation.operations.SelectTest.testMixedTTLOnColumnsWide}} is flaky. This is because it inserts rows and then asserts their contents using {{ttl()}} in the select, but if the test is sufficiently slow, the remaining ttl may change by the time the select is run. Anecdotally, {{testSelectWithAlias}} in the same class uses a fudge factor of 1 second that would fix all the failures I've seen, but it might make more sense to measure the elapsed time in the test and calculate the acceptable variation from that time.
