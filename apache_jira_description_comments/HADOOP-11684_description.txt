Currently, if fs.s3a.max.total.tasks are queued and another (part)upload wants to start, a RejectedExecutionException is thrown. 

We should use a threadpool that blocks clients, nicely throtthling them, rather than throwing an exception. F.i. something similar to https://github.com/apache/incubator-s4/blob/master/subprojects/s4-comm/src/main/java/org/apache/s4/comm/staging/BlockingThreadPoolExecutorService.java
