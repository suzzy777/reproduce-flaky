IMPALA-7051: Serialize Maven invocations.

I've observed some rare cases where Impala fails to build. I believe
it's because two Maven targets (yarn-extras and ext-data-source) are
being executed simultaneously. Maven's handling of ~/.m2/repository,
for example, is known to be not safe.

This patch serializes the Maven builds with the following
dependency graph:
  fe -> yarn-extras -> ext-data-source -> impala-parent
The ordering of yarn-extras -> ext-data-source is arbitrary.

I decided that this artificial dependency was the clearest
way to prevent parallel executions. Having mvn-quiet.sh
take a lock seemed considerably more complex.

IMPALA-9008: Serialize Maven invocations to deflake impala-minimal-hive-exec

Building impala-minimal-hive-exec was flaky (sometimes it failed
to download Guava 14.0.1), and my guess is that it is related to
downloading the same dependency in parallel with ext-data-source.

Similarly to the solution in IMPALA-7051, I try to fix it by
adding a fictional dependency (ext-data-source -> shaded-deps)
to serialize the build.

Full Maven dependency graph:
fe -> yarn-extras -> ext-data-source -> shaded-deps -> impala-parent
The ordering of yarn-extras, ext-data-source, and shaded-deps are
arbitrary.

Testing:
- I never reproduced the original flakiness, so I just hope
  that it disappears with this change.
