@Lars
I was thinking that the millisecond diff was not working fine in WINDOWS seeing HBASE-6833.  I have a question here,
Why in Jenkins it has never failed and frequently fails when run in WINDOWS?  Just wanted to know the reason in the delay that happens in the timestamp updation.  Thanks Lars.

@Ram:
Most Unix's have good timers (I know Linux has), so it is rare that the two Puts here receive the same timestamp (but still possible, so the test was still bad).

The last time I played with timers on Windows I found that the timer resolution there is about 10ms (but that was many years ago and might be better now).


Ok.... Thank you :)
