It might behave differently when run inside an IDE rather than with {{ant}}. I think I've hit that before.  Does this pass for you?

{noformat}
ant testclasslist -Dtest.classlistprefix=unit -Dtest.classlistfile=<(echo org/apache/cassandra/config/DatabaseDescriptorRefTest.java)

{noformat}


Yes, that works actually. I am surprised because I am 100% sure that some time ago I was working on that class and everything was passing(in the IDE). Also, it was failing for two of us but not for [~brandon.williams]. [~brandonwilliams], did you actually run it from IDE or the command line?

Do you know what is the reason so I can add a comment in the test for example? For others so they don't troubleshoot and raise tickets :D And thank you for the quick response, appreciate it :) 

I never run from the IDE. :) I guess I should have clarified that before.

It fails for me from inside IDEA

{noformat}
java.lang.AssertionError: thread started in clientInitialization 
Expected :6
Actual   :9

{noformat}

however this also passes for me

{code}
ant testsome -Dtest.name=org.apache.cassandra.config.DatabaseDescriptorRefTest -Dtest.method=testDatabaseDescriptorRef
{code}

I suspect the issue is test runner setup for the fancy IDE.  I wonder if it's possible to detect running outside of the regular ant runner and just skip the test in that case, though I'm interested if others can reproduce [~brandon.williams]'s failure.

bq. reproduce Brandon Williams's failure.

I think you misunderstood, I'm the one who doesn't run it in an IDE and it doesn't fail for me. :)

fwiw, the test passes successfully for me, when I try it both from my IDE (idea) and from command line.

JFYI.

The test passed via {{ant}}, however, failed in IDE:
{code:java}
java.lang.AssertionError: thread started in clientInitialization 
Expected :5
Actual   :8
{code}
Environment:
 * Intellij Idea 2021.2.2
 * JDK 8u281
 * Ant 1.10.10
 * Ubuntu 20.04

[~e.dimitrova] [~brandon.williams] [~sumanth.pasupuleti]

I've taken a look to the test a bit closer and here is what I can see:
 # it sometimes (once per ~15 runs) passes in Intellij in "run" mode
 # it always passes in Intellij in "debug" mode
 # the problem is caused by "Attach Listener" which is related to [Dynamic Attach|http://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/docs/Serviceability.html] feature of JVM
 # if I add {{-XX:+DisableAttachMechanism}} parameter then the test always pass in Intellij in "run" mode

Conclusion:
 # the test works in "debug" mode because Intellij attaches to JVM though an agentlib, not through "Dynamic Attach":
{code:java}-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=127.0.0.1:59053,suspend=y,server=n{code}
This is parameter is the only difference between "run" and "debug" configuration
 # the issue is caused by IDE (Intellij in my case) which tries to attach to the JVM. I found no details on how to disable such a behavior in Intellij for "run" mode.
 # {{ant}} works fine because no process tries to attach to JVM

I came up with a fix and here is the summary of changes:
 # started ignoring "Attach Listener" thread
 # started ignoring Logback-related threads by names instead of having assumption that two additional threads are always Logback-related
 # started filtering out multiple Logback basic threads (while debugging the problem I mentioned that sometimes two threads _logback-1_ and _logback-2_ are spawned)
 # fixed warnings

Here are the patches:
 * [3.11|https://github.com/alex-ninja/cassandra/commit/5bf8f1debfd547b5c8e613b294b50ea8f56a3367]
 * [4.0|https://github.com/alex-ninja/cassandra/commit/c7de42d70dd28bbc9049286f9db7f8b3fb2f6b7d]
 * [trunk|https://github.com/alex-ninja/cassandra/commit/683fea50002694bce27b3b687194f5db3ef11fd1]

Could you please review them and try out on your local machines. 

Nice detective work!  On the surface this all makes sense to me, but I will leave review to someone who has experienced this issue.

Moved it to Patch available, I will look at it later. Thanks!!

I'll look at it and test. Marking as "NEEDS COMMITTER" in the meantime as we need second reviewer committer. 

Tested the latest trunk version and it looks good. Good catch!
CircleCI didn't show issues, also I tested manually:
- once and multiple times run in Intellij
- once and multiple times run in debug mode Intellij
- once and multiple times with code coverage in Intellij
- also nothing changed around ant 
I think we need the patch on all other branches and a second committer. Thank you!

Thanks for testing the changes [~e.dimitrova]! I updated all the branches:
 * [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...alex-ninja:cassandra-16862_db_descriptor_test-3.11]
 * [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...alex-ninja:cassandra-16862_db_descriptor_test-4.0]
 * [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...alex-ninja:cassandra-16862_db_descriptor_test-trunk]

 

Tested all branches, +1
[~jmeredithco], do you think you can check this one too? Should be quick, I promise :D 

Sure, I'll take a look.

Also tested 3.11, 4.0 and trunk under IDEA and on the command line with ant.

+1

Thank you [~psynix@t-online.de] and [~azotcsit], I am going to commit the patch soon.
