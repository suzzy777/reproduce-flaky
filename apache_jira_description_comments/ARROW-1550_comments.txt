    ARROW-1550: [Python] Explicitly close owned file handles in ParquetWriter.close to avoid Windows flakiness

    I can reproduce this failure locally, but I'm unsure why this just now started happening. The 0.7.0 release build passed (https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/arrow/build/1.0.3357/job/477b1iicmwuy51l8) and there haven't been related code changes since then. Either way it's better to close the sink explicitly

    +1. It looks like Travis CI has some kind of apt problems tonight
