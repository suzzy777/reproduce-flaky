I still have this problem on each rebase.
I'am on Windows7 without proxy but I can't download google-web-fonts.

The only way to complete zeppelin-web build is to comment 'goog-webfont-dl' in Gruntfile.js or add --force in frontend-maven-plugin (but I don't like it beacuse it applies to all grunt build tasks).

I've found this: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin/issues/321
But it doesn't work.

In \zeppelin-web\node_modules\grunt\node_modules\grunt-legacy-util\index.js, line 182

    //args = opts.args || [];
    cmd = process.execPath;
    args = [].concat(opts.cmd, opts.args);

I edit the code and it works. 
so, I'm afraid that goog-webfont-dl or grunt-legacy-util don't supports on windows7.

I confirm that it works with your hints.
Probably it is a grunt problem that must be investigated.

The zeppelin-web module build is always tricky from a Windows env (not my choise).
I think it's important to have a clean build in order to foster enteprise adoption.

    üëç  Idea sounds great to me. It looks like https://github.com/optimalisatie/grunt-goog-webfont-dl is not maintained but https://github.com/Mika-/grunt-google-fonts had changes this year.
    
    I tried locally in dev mode (\wo maven) `npm i; npm run start` and the fonts were not loaded - could you fix that please?

    Same on current master works as expected (fonts are loaded).
    
    --------
    
    CI is failing on single profile \w flaky test `ZeppelinSparkClusterTest.pySparkDepLoaderTest`
    It will be handled separatly under [ZEPPELIN-1761](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1761).

    @bzz Thanks for your comment. The file 'google-fonts.css' is created during zeppelin-web build. 
    You need to run `npm run build`.

    @bzz I have checked it works in dev mode after grunt build.
    And I decided not to add the task 'googlefonts' to grunt serve.
    It's not need to download google fonts every server start in dev mode.
