Could this be related to KAFKA-7697 ?

The stack trace shows that the threads are not deadlocked, but making progress, just slow. Will increase timeout in the test.

   Stack trace generated from the test failure shows that the test failed even though threads were runnable and making progress, indicating that the timeout may be too small when test machine is slow. Increasing timeout from 10 to 15 seconds, consistent with the default wait in other tests. Thread dump also showed a lot of left over threads from other tests, so added clean up of those as well.
   
   I wasn't able to recreate the failure with or without the fix.
