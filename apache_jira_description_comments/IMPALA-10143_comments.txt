IMPALA-10143: TestAcid.test_full_acid_original_files is flaky

One of the test queries depended on the values of the row__id.rowid
field. In rare cases the files are written differently by Hive which
leads to different 'rowid' values for the rows.

I took out the test for the 'rowid' values in that particular query.

We have other tests for the 'rowid' field on static data files (from
'testdata/data'), therefore we still have coverage for that and they
shouldn't be flaky.
