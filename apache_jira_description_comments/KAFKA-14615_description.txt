Since Scala 2.12 is being deprecated in 4.x version, we can utilize some improved methods for comparing size of scala collections which were introduced starting 2.13.

This task is to find and replace usage of code paths where we use (IterableA.size == IterableB.size) having a complexity of O(IterableA size + IterableB size) with sizeCompare() method which has a complexity of O(min(IterableA size, IterableB size))

Some examples where sizeCompare() could be used are:
