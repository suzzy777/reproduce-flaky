IMPALA-11736: Copy data between ofs buckets

When Impala moves a file - such as for a LOAD DATA statement - it checks
whether the source and destination are the same filesystem. If the same,
it uses hdfsRename, otherwise it uses hdfsMove to move between
filesystems.

Ozone's ofs protocol supports referencing multiple buckets by path in
the same filesystem, but does not support rename between them. All other
filesystems Impala supports include the bucket name (if they use that
concept) in the authority. This patch updates the function used to
determine whether two paths are in the same filesystem to also check
that they're in the same bucket as a requirement for hdfsRename.

Testing: ran test suite with Ozone.

IMPALA-11794: Fix flakiness of TestLoadDataExternal.test_load by using dedicated table name

IMPALA-11736 adds TestLoadDataExternal that uses the same table name
used by an existing test (TestLoadData). These two tests both will clean
up the test tables at the beginning and at the end. If they run
concurrently, one of them will fail. Note that e2e tests are ran in
parallel by default.

This patch fixes TestLoadDataExternal to use a dedicated table name.

Tests:
 - Verified locally
