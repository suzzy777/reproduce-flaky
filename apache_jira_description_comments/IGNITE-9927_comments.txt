It might be the same problems as in [IGNITE-9928|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-9928]

[~gvvinblade], patch is ready for review. Tests look good. Spring suite is not a blocker - the same problems exist in the master branch.

[~rkondakov], looks like
 # "newValue" is set to GridCacheUpdateTxResult unconditionally, however it useful only if a continuous query needs the "newValue".
 #  there is a flag "needOldValue" (as mvccSet method param) that force us to retrieve old value for continuous query as the only purpose.

Les't refactor this flag and use as condition for return both "old" and "new" values via GridCacheUpdateTxResult, if it is possible.

I've found newValue is the value that passed to backups. So, PR is ok, we just have to add missed newValue() call.

Thanks.

The test will be broken with IGNITE-10976.
Let's make proper Mvcc write conflict checks after 10976 will be merged and re-run TC.

[~amashenkov], [~gvvinblade], I've merged patch with updated master and fixed MVCC write conflict handling. TC looks good. Patch is ready for review.

[~rkondakov], I've left a comment to the PR.

There are 2 places where you check Exception messages.
It is not clear, why transaction rollback is expected. 
Also we can add checks if exception cause belongs to certain TransactionException classes.

[~amashenkov]. I've removed tx rollback exception checking and left only write conflict check. Tests look good. Patch is ready for review and merge.

Oops! I've fixed exception handling only in the one place of two ones you mentioned. Will fix it soon.

Fixed. Patch is ready for review.

[~rkondakov], could you please re-merge the ticket with master and re-run tests? Probably it is a bit outdated at the moment.

[~vozerov], [~amashenkov], I've merged PR with a latest master and rerun tests. TC looks good. Patch is ready for review.

[~rkondakov], merged to master.
Thanks for contribution!
