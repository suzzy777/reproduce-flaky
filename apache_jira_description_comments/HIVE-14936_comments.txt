Similar issue exists in orc_ppd_basic. The diff is similar.


Added new PostExec hooks to print selective counters that are required for the PPD tests. 

[~sseth] Can you please review this patch?

Think it's worth investigating why these diffs occur, before removing them. HDFS_BYTES, numRercods should remain unchanged across runs?

I have updated the patch to remove some cases that can cause flakiness
- timestamp column can cause difference in file size when the files are generated across different timezones (orc's stripe footer stores timezone string)
- map aggregation is disabled for these tests as that may cause difference in intermediate record count
- in case where the test explicitly tests for timestamp, new post hook is added to print only the selected row group count

[~sseth] Could you take another look?

+1

Committed to master. Please reopen this if the flakiness is seen again.
