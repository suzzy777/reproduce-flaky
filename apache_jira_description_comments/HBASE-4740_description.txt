Running TestHFileOutputFormat more frequently seems to show that it has become flaky.   It is difficult to tell if this is because of a unrecoverable failure or a recoverable failure.   To make this visiable from test and for users, we need to make a change to bulkload call's interface on HRegionServer.  The change should make successful rpcs return true, recoverable failures return false, and unrecoverable failure throw an IOException.  This is an RPC change, so it would be really good to get this api right before the final 0.92 goes out.
