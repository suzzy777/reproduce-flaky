Capacity scheduler does not support DRF (Dominant Resource Fairness) ordering policy on queue level. Only "fifo" and "fair" are accepted for {{yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.ordering-policy}}.

DRF can only be used globally if {{yarn.scheduler.capacity.resource-calculator}} is set to DominantResourceCalculator.
