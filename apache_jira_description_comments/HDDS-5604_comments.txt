Uploaded the artefacts from a failed run. Also raised HDDS-5624 to disable the test for now, as its impeding progress on a lot of PRs.

Thanks [~sodonnell] for the initiative.

bq. Uploaded the artefacts from a failed run.

[~elek]'s repository stores artifacts from all failed runs on {{master}}, see links in issue description.

I think we can reduce overhead by using the same issue for disabling and fixing the test.  A oneliner change adding {{\@Ignore("HDDS-...")}} is straightforward enough.

[~adoroszlai] Thanks for the info. So do you think that for each flaky test we should create a single Jira "Fix test xyz". Submit a PR to disable it and commit, and then leave the Jira open for later fixing it?

I know you have addressed a lot of failing tests in the past - do you think we should create an umbrella / epic jira and move all these test problems under it? That way it would be much easier to see how many we have disable pending fixes etc.

Yes, I think so.  (I would go even further by disabling without PR, but at least now PR skips acceptance/kubernetes in these cases.)

I am managing the 1.2.0 release and we currently have more than 600 issues targeted for 1.2.0. I am moving the target field to 1.3.0.

If you are actively working on this jira and believe this should be targeted for the 1.2.0 release, Please reach out to me via Apache email or Slack.
