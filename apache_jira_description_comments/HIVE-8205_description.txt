In HIVE-7735, schema info was plumbed to ETypeConverter to disambiguate between hive Char, Varchar and String types, which are all represented as PrimitiveType "binary" and OriginalType "utf8" in parquet.

However, this does not work for parquet nested types (that map to hive Array, Map, etc.) containing these values, because schema lookup for nested values was not implemented.  It's also non-trivial to do that in the current parquet serde implementation. Instead of plumbing in the schema, we should convert 
these types to the same Text writeable and let the object inspectors handle the final conversion.
