[~txsing]
Thanks for adding the tests! (and sorry for the long review cycle)
Can you please check on the failing test? testRerunWithExistingConf(org.apache.oozie.command.wf.TestReRunXCommand)
Also, please update DG_WorkflowReRun.twiki to represent the changes in the code.


[~txsing] do you happen to have time to finish this JIRA soon? Thanks!

[~andras.piros], [~gezapeti] hey, sorry for late response. I just settled down in a new city, will finish this patch soon.
