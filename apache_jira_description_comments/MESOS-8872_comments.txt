    Made an operation reconciliation test more robust.

    `OperationReconciliationTest.AgentPendingOperationAfterMasterFailover`
    is currently flaky on slow machines.

    This patch temporarily resumes the clock after the master failover and
    until the agent reregisters. This should avoid deadlocks and make the
    test reliable.
