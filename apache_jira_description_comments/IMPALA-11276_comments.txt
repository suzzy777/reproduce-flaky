Hi [~LiPenglin], just encountered this last week, looks like it is caused by the sorting added in IMPALA-11256, could you take a look at this please?

Hi [~tmate] , I will try to reproduce this situation at master branch latest code, please assign it to me.

Commit 5a73401f3e3d27423109ad0478320efca7a459af in impala's branch refs/heads/master from LPL

IMPALA-11276: Fix TestIcebergTable.test_partitioned_insert became flaky

TestIcebergTable.Test_partitioned_insert test is not stable because
SHOW FILES on Iceberg table will sort the list of FILES. So restore the
original VERIFY_IS_SUBSET for some flaky cases.
