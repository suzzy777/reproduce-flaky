Looks like the condition that fails is *parsed <= now + threshold*

_assertTrue_("'now' timestamp not within expected tolerance.", now <= parsed && parsed <= now + threshold);

The issue is that the comparison is done between the output of {{System.currentTimeMillis}} and the output of the {{Clock}} used by the function. The test need to use the output of the {{Clock}} for computing the expected value. 

Linked a branch and 100 repeated runs in Circle.

+1 on this patch. Just wanted to mention that quick grep showed me we might have similar issue with other unit tests too. (even if they are not failing)

Not sure whether we want to address this as part of this ticket or another one.

I noticed the same, but there are over 300 instances, so  I made CASSANDRA-17123 for that.

Committed.
