TestStore#testDeleteExpiredStoreFiles failure seems to be related to the patch.

{quote}TestStore#testDeleteExpiredStoreFiles failure seems to be related to the patch.{quote}
Not sure if is related, since TestStore doesn't follow any code path for the FileLink. seems more a flaky test that uses sleep to verify the result...
but I'll take a deeper look at that.

Patch from Matteo.

@Ted When you say 'Patch from Matteo', what does that mean?  He sent it to you to upload?  Or you are doing something else?  Is Matteo indisposed, unable to contribute his own patch to Apache for some reason?  Just wondering.

Patch v5 was the latest version on review board.

You should ask Matteo to copy it over.  Its his patch.  Only he can contrib it to Apache.

Good suggestion.
Will do that next time.

[~jesse_yates] Can you +1 Matteo's last patch up on RB if you are down w/ it?  I'd like to commit.

[~mbertozzi] Is your most recent RB attached here Matteo?  Would like to have hadoopqa run it.  Thanks.

[~saint.ack@gmail.com] commented on RB - almost there, mostly nits (and possibly some matter of the late hour of the review).

do we want to roll this into the 0.96 or the snapshots branch? Seems like its only being used in snapshots, but given the breadth of code it touches, I'd be ok with it going into trunk and then ported over to snapshots (or vice-versa, as long as it happens in a short period of time).

[~jesse_yates] Thanks.   Good review.  I'd say roll this into trunk.  How do I get it into our snapshot branch.  Can you do that?

[~saint.ack@gmail.com] I can roll it into the snapshots branch (DM me if you want commit access to avoid bottle-necks).

[~jesse_yates] Whatever is easiest for you.  I wouldn't mind rolling it into trunk because its been well-reviewed.

[~saint.ack@gmail.com] trunk is fine, I need to rebase snapshots soon anyways. 
[~mbertozzi] another review is up. And don't sweat the test failure, this isn't related.

Trying v8 against hadoopqa

What I applied... org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ResourceCheckerJUnitRule is not needed in tests anymore (and moved to hbase-common so wouldn't compile).  Instead, nkeywal provided the same resource checking via a surefile 'Listener', a config added to the plugin in the pom.

Committed to trunk.  Nice one Matteo.  I made a pass at a release note.  Feel free to improve.   Nice reviewing Jesse (I think this one of the most reviewed patches in hbase history -- good going lads)
