I created 3 separate PR builds to replace the existing one:

https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk7-scala2.10/
https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk8-scala2.11/
https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk8-scala2.12/

Each build status is shown separately and they can execute concurrently:

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2231

A few advantages:

1. We are now testing JDK 8 as part of the PR builds as well
2. By running in concurrently, they should finish faster
3. Flaky tests will be more obvious as they are unlikely to fail in all builds


Works like a charm:
