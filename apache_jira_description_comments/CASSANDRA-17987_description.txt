CircleCI has a set of jobs for running specialiazed unit tests that are only run with Java 8:
 * utests_compression
 * utests_system_keyspace_directory
 * utests_trie
 * utests_stress
 * utests_long
 * utests_fqltool

It should probably be possible to run these tests with Java 11 tool.

Rather than creating a ticket for every job, it's probably easier to use a single ticket for all of them. This should give us an overall vision for deciding job names, approval steps, etc. Also, the required config changes should be quite minimal and doing all of them at once should save us both effort and test runs.
