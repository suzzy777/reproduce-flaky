To help with our support cases, I've built a tool that collects a bunch of job and other information from Oozie that throws it all in a tarball.  The idea is that the user can just click a button in Cloudera Manager, and it will run this tool.  

This tool could be useful for others as an easy way to get information out of Oozie, so I thought I'd contribute it here.  It's built as a "tool" (so it sits next to the sharelib and database tools), and simply uses the Oozie client for getting pretty much everything, so it doesn't require anything special.

Here's the information that it can get:
# Sharelib: {{ooze admin -shareliblist}} and {{oozie admin -shareliblist <foo>}}
# Oozie Server's resolved loaded configuration (from admin endpoint)
# Other admin commands output (queue dump, env vars, etc)
# Thread dump (HOST:11000/oozie/admin/jvminfo.jsp)
# Details from last n jobs and/or specific list of jobs
#- job.properties contents
#- XML definition
#- verbose status for each job and each action etc
#- Oozie logs
#- Unfortunately, we can't get the launcher jobs' logs from Hadoop
# Metrics/Instrumentation
