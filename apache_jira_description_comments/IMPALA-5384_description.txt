The coordinator has a central lock (lock_) which is used very liberally to synchronize state changes that don't need to be synchronized, creating a concurrency bottleneck.

Also, the coordinator contains a number of data structures related to INSERT finalization that don't need to be part of and synchronized with the rest of the coordinator state.
