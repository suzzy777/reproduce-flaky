Thanks for the contribution [~zuston]! Can you please upload the patch to ReviewBoard? Thanks!

Thanks [~andras.piros]. The review board link is [https://reviews.apache.org/r/69469].

Thanks [~zuston]. Overall direction is OK. Please add some unit tests, and sample {{oozie-instrumentation.log}} snippets.

Thanks [~andras.piros]. I have submitted the {{oozie-3393-2.patch}} and {{oozie-instrumentation.log}} snippets. In addition, I have uploaded the patch in review board.

But I don't know how to add unit tests, because the {{TestMetricsInstrumentation}} and {{TestInstrumentation}} classes are all general method, not to test specific metrics. If you know, please tell me. Thanks :D

[~zuston] you're welcome. Patch 002 looks good to me thus far. One remaining point being unit testing.

I'd create new test cases in {{TestCoordMaterializeTriggerService}} with following semantics:
 * setting things up and waiting till a task gets into {{CoordinatorJob.Status.RUNNING}} [like this|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/apache/oozie/service/TestCoordMaterializeTriggerService.java#L77-L84]
 * asserting that the service was instrumented by accessing {{Services.get().get(InstrumentationService).get().getVariables()}}

Thanks [~andras.piros]. Patch 003  has uploaded to review board, the link is  [https://reviews.apache.org/r/69469]. I am looking forward to your comment.

I change the status of the Jira to patch available, so PreCommit will pick up the patch and execute the tests.

Test error looks unrelated. [~asalamon74] :)

[~zuston] For me, the test error looks related, your new test case fails. Could you please check it.

[~asalamon74] Sorry, after recheck the test case, i have uploaded patch-4. In order to use the {{MetricsInstrumentationService.getMetricRegistry}} in the {{TestCoordMaterializeTriggerService.testCoordMaterializeTriggerService4}}, I have to change the scope of the {{getMetricRegistry}} method to public.

[~asalamon74] This test case looks unrelated. :D

Could you please review it [~asalamon74], thanks.

[~zuston] Yes, this test failure really looks unrelated.

Just one last request: Could could please add assert message to the {{assertNotNull}} calls?

[~asalamon74] oozie-3393-5.patch is ok. 

Thanks for the contribution [~zuston], +1, committed to master.

Sorry, i wrote a bug. Because {{GET_COORD_JOBS_OLDER_FOR_MATERIALIZATION}} only get the id to bean, the metric of mat_delayed_size is always zero.

Now i fix it. Please review the patch [~asalamon74]

Because {{GET_COORD_JOBS_OLDER_FOR_MATERIALIZATION}} only get the id to bean, the metric of mat_delayed_size is always zero.

Changing the status, so precommit can pick up the amend patch.
