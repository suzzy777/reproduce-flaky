This issue happens after YARN-8720.

Before that, AMS uses scheduler.getMaximumAllocation to do the normalization. After that, AMS uses LeafQueue.getMaximumAllocation. The scheduler one uses nodeTracker.getMaximumAllocation, but the LeafQueue.getMaximum doesn't.Â 

We should use the scheduler.getMaximumAllocation to cap the per-queue's maximum-allocation every time.
