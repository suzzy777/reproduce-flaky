Sometimes it is worth to allocate data region on specific numa node or on interleaved node (i.e. Intel Optane can be set up as a little bit slower, but cheaper than and have more capacity, than DDR, and unified as NUMA nodes). 

Need to write C++ wrapper around {{libnuma}} and extract common allocator interface and add as a configuration parameter to {{DataRegionConfiguration}}
