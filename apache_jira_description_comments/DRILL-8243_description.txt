As part of DRILL-8241, this PR moves the json configuration options out of the HTTP plugin and creates a file which can be used for other plugins that consume JSON data.Â 

The idea being that all such plugins, like Druid, ES, Mongo, can set the same JSON options for each plugin instance w/o having to duplicate config code.
