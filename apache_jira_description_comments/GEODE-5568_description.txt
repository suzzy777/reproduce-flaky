h2. Original Description

(original title of this ticket was *testCacheOpAfterQueryCancel in QueryMonitorDUnitTest fails intermittently*)

*We* should remove flakiness from test
*Before* we add more features around Query Monitor
*Because* flaky tests do not inspire confidence

*Notes*
When running [PR 2311|https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/2311], a test failed that passed on a rerun (see [here|http://files.apachegeode-ci.info/builds/geode-pr-2311/test-results/distributedTest/1534096152/classes/org.apache.geode.cache.query.dunit.QueryMonitorDUnitTest.html#testCacheOpAfterQueryCancel])

The build artifacts are available [here|http://files.apachegeode-ci.info/builds/geode-pr-2311/test-artifacts/1534096152/distributedtestfiles-geode-pr-2311.tgz]

Since it is a timing issue, it could be a few things so not sure on best path forward.

h2. Update October, 2018

After seeing more failures on October 2, we decided to fix this bug. We discovered an actual product bug in the {{QueryMonitor}}. We also discovered that the "hot path" of of monitoring and then un-monitoring a query scaled poorly: time complexity was O(N) where N is the number of queries currently being monitored. As a result, our fix entailed mostly rewriting the {{QueryMonitor}} class to use a more appropriate (off-the-shelf) data structure.
