[~tarmstrong] can you help triage and reassign if necessary?

Root cause of the OOM is IMPALA-2708. This will all change when the buffer pool patch lands, but I'll put rogther a temporary fix ahead of that.

Will close for now and reopen if we see it again.

IMPALA-5691: recalibrate mem limit for Q18

I ran the stress test binary search locally and it produced a slightly
higher number for Q18 than the hardcoded value. This is enough to move
it above one of the thresholds, so may reduce flakiness.

Testing:
I wasn't able to reproduce the flakiness locally, so can't confirm
this fixes it.
