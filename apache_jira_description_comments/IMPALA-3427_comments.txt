[~abehm], you're next in my shuffled list of people for this week's rotation; feel free to find another person or assign back to me if you're swamped.


[~lv] Jim is out of the office / PTO. I've taken this.

Also I suppose you weren't able to run this test locally because it requires the functional-query exploration strategy to be exhaustive; otherwise it's skipped.

    IMPALA-3427: test_insert_wide_table: use unique_database fixture
    
    test_insert_wide_table runs in parallel attempts to DROP/CREATE tables
    with the same name into the same database. A race thus exists in which
    one tests can stomp on each others' tables.
    
    The fix is to use the unique_database fixture, in which each test can
    run in parallel within its own database, and thus its own table.
