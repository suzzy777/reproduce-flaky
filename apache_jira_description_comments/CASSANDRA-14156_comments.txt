Failed again just now:

in 3.11 and trunk we need to run {{relocatesstables}} to move tokens to their correct places, then we need to run a major compaction to make sure that there are no overlapping tokens

[~jasobrown] could you review?

I was able to repro the flakey fail after 17 runs on my laptop. With [~krummas]'s patch, it ran 50 times without fail.

The [debug statement|https://github.com/krummas/cassandra-dtest/commit/42e9125c189f61dd31a2fc0a157b95e6ecea4cf1#diff-376c5cd8425c9b4b078f87a20db738b9R300] in the patch should be removed as it fails hard with the following error:

{noformat}
test_movement failed and was not selected for rerun.
	<class 'NameError'>
	name 'debug' is not defined
	[<TracebackEntry /opt/orig/1/opt/dev/cassandra-dtest/topology_test.py:300>]
{noformat}
 
As it's not essential, you can probably remove it. Otherwise, +1.
