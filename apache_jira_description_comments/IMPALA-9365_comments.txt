IMPALA-9617: Skip tests that use Hive on non-HDFS filesystems

Some tests are flaky due to timeouts in Hive queries on non-HDFS
filesystems. Until IMPALA-9365 is resolved we only run these tests
when the target filesystem is HDFS.

IMPALA-9365: Disable acid-negative.test on non-HDFS filesystems

It looks like IMPALA-9484 might have accidentally broken
acid-negative.test on non-HDFS filesystems. This patch skips this test
for all filesystems, except for HDFS.

The issue is that acid-negative.test was modified to run several Hive
queries, but Impala currently does not support running Hive queries on
non-HDFS filesystems.

IMPALA-10683: Skip test 'test_double_precision' for non-HDFS test env

TestHdfsParquetTableWriter.test_double_parser uses Hive statement.
IMPALA-9365 describes why HS2 is not started on non-HDFS test env
and therefore we need to skip this test for such test environments.
Hive statement is being used as Impala's result are converted
by python to string. In both HS2 and beewax, it only handles float
precision uptil 16 decimal digits and test needs 17.
