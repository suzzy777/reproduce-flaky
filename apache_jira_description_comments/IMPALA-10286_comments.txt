I think it would be just simpler to skip this test on S3 due to the unpredictability of listing times on S3. The test is pretty stable on HDFS runs so we should have the coverage on those builds.

Makes sense, thank you!

Commit c9ccb61acb6d0060de10833b4b37df096baa2cd3 in impala's branch refs/heads/master from Vihang Karajgaonkar

IMPALA-10286: Disable metadata.test_catalogd_debug_actions on S3

This patch disables metadata/test_catalogd_debug_actions
test on S3 builds due to its flakiness. The root cause of this
seems to be that listing time on S3 is variable and the test
becomes flaky because it measures the time taken by refresh
command after a certain debug action is set.

Testing:
1. Ran the test on my local environment to make sure it
compiles fine.
