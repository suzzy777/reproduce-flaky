There are a lot of Thread.sleep() calls in TestMemoryLocks.

For example:
{code}
        new Thread(l1).start();
        Thread.sleep(500);
        new Thread(l2).start();
        Thread.sleep(500);
{code}

This solution is very fragile. On a slower build machine, Thread2 might actually start earlier than Thread1, causing test failure.

Eliminate sleeps and use a more stable approach for start/stop coordination (possibly CountDownLatches).
