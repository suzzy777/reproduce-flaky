1. In ZOOKEEPER-1634 all properties names are in context of SASL. Now the context is broad and 3.6.0 is not released yet so i think we can change the property names. Giving new name to properties.  enforce.auth.enabled and enforce.auth.scheme
2. There is no need to do special handling for allowSaslFailedClients scenario. When enforce authentication is enabled allowSaslFailedClients is implied to be false. So we can take this as false in case enforce.auth.enabled=true
Moreover allowSaslFailedClients seems to be a testing property. It makes no sense to enable enforce authentication and allow failed SASL authentication. If someone wants to allow failed authentication he will not enable enforce authentication and vice versa.
3. I think it may not be required to introduce new response code SESSIONCLOSEDREQUIRESASLAUTH. Exploring bit more if we can use AUTHFAILED

Thanks [~anmolnar], [~eolivelli], [~ztzg] for reviewing the PR

 

I think this issue should be merged to branch-3.6 also. What is your thought [~hanm]

[~arshad.mohammad] To be honest I don't have much visibility on the criteria of cherry picking master commits to other branches these days ... [~eolivelli] might have more contexts as he's managing recent releases. Feel free to start a thread on dev list about this topic (I am curious myself).

It is ok, let it be only in master branch
