With the ability to provide names for all operators in a Kafka Streams topology ([https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-307%3A+Allow+to+define+custom+processor+names+with+KStreams+DSL]) coming in the 2.4 release, we also need to add this new feature to the Streams Scala API.

KIP-307 was refined via KIP-479 ([https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-479%3A+Add+StreamJoined+config+object+to+Join]) and this ticket should cover both cases.
