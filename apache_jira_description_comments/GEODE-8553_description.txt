During my troublshootings, I've seen that locking m_locatorLock for the whole scope of the class function members might cause some inter-locks.

Problem here and in many other places of the NC is that networking operations are performed while a mutex is locked. Therefore if *thread A* takes longer than expected in performing its network operation, it might block another one which does not requires any resource of the first *thread A*. Hence, the inter-lock.

This improvement is the first one of a series regarding to lock scope reduction when it comes with code regarding networking in NC.
