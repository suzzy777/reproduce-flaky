{{ItTableRaftSnapshotsTest.snapshotInstallationRepeatsOnTimeout}} became flaky on the main

I see from logs that node, that we try to restart, cannot join cluster. It happens because it cannot resolve peer of the leader when it tries to start CMG raft group service, {{getByConsistentId}} returns null.

{code:java}
ClusterNode node = cluster.topologyService().getByConsistentId(peer.consistentId());
{code}

Also I see from the leader's log, that this restarted node is removed from the topology


{noformat}
Node left [member=ClusterNodeImpl [id=64e75771-1f64-47d7-866f-14087ab182fa, name=itrst_sirot_2, address=127.0.0.1:3346, nodeMetadata=null], eventType=REMOVED]
{noformat}

When test pass successfully, we see logs like this 


{noformat}
Node left (noop as it has already reappeared) [member=ClusterNodeImpl [id=52a3656a-5bc6-4b20-8796-b92971ae84a4, name=itrst_sirot_2, address=127.0.0.1:3346, nodeMetadata=null], eventType=REMOVED]
{noformat}

The difference is that successful run contains this {{(noop as it has already reappeared)}}.
