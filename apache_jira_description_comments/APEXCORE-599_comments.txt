I could reproduce it on a Ubuntu VM by picking a specific test and run it long enough like this:

{code}
while mvn test -Dtest=ParDoBoundTranslatorTest#testMultiOutputParDoWithSideInputs; do :; done
{code}

Enable tuple tracing in the pipeline options and it will make it easier to see how the last tuple even though it was emitted by the input operator in the streaming window *before* shutdown never makes it downstream.



[~thw] Can it be caused by APEXCORE-645?
