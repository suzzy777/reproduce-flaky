A similar problem was observed in HIVE-24395 but unfortunately as it is revealed by this case the fix is not enough to guarantee that the database is ready.

A solution which seems to guarantee that the database is ready is to check in the log messages that the message _"database system is ready to accept connections"_ appears twice. The problem was fixed in testcontainers project in the same way (see the respective [commit|https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/commit/36613b88bcf3ab60ad046bfde7ee2eabd538dacf]).

Fixed in [a72db99676ca6a79b414906ab78963a3e955ae69|https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/a72db99676ca6a79b414906ab78963a3e955ae69]. Thanks for the quick review [~pvary] !
