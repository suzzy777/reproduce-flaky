[~nobigo] What was the exact command line which gave you this error message?

Hi，[~asalamon74],Can you help me release OOZIE-2338? Thank you very much.

[~nobigo] To keep the comments clean, please write a comment to OOZIE-2338 if your question is related to that jira.

Hi,[~asalamon74],I find this issue when run TestXLogStreamingService.java. It is about openjpa.Enhance.

Unfortunately if someone just uploads a patch the status will remain OPEN and precommit build will not be triggered. I try to submit a patch without really uploading a new file, hopefully it will change the status to PATCH AVAILABLE.

[~nobigo] Thanks for the patch. I was unable to reproduce the problem, this test class works for me (and for the precommit job) with the {{1.0}} and {{2.0}} versions as well. As the precommit checks states, this change will break backward compatibility, I don't think it's a good idea to do that. These orm files refer to a deprecated class ( {{org.apache.oozie.client.rest.JsonSLAEvent}} ) and I'm not sure if the files are in use, we long time switched to using JPA annotations. Probably we need to clean up this part of the database as a subtask of OOZIE-3336 .

[~nobigo], can you please share exactly how did you tried to run the test when it failed with this error? I have run the test from Maven and from Idea as well, and it passed in both cases, so I was unable to reproduce the issue as well.

I also agree with [~asalamon74] that even if we will need to update those files, we should check if we really need those, since using both XML and annotations for mappings in the same project is not really recommended. Maybe we should get rid of the xmls?

So I would suggest to do this cleanup/update as a subtask of OOZIE-3336.
