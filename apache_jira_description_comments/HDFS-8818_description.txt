The original design of Balancer is intentionally to make it run slowly so that the balancing activities won't affect the normal cluster activities and the running jobs.

There are new use case that cluster admin may choose to balance the cluster when the cluster load is low, or in a maintain window.  So that we should have an option to allow Balancer to run faster.
