I saw a few examples recently. 2 have the same error, but the third is different

The failure is like


{code:java}
java.lang.AssertionError: Did not receive all 5 records from topic output-stream-1 within 60000 ms, currently accumulated data is [] Expected: is a value equal to or greater than <5> but: <0> was less than <5>{code}

The other failure was
