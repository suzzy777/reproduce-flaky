I already created IMPALA-2991 to revisit the tests

IMPALA-2994: Temporary workaround for flaky spilling test

The test was recently reenabled in commit
71a0a7d998702781ae44270f8c742b10c34c0efc.

Continue running the test but loosen the memory limit and don't check
the runtime profile. The memory limits for this set of tests needs
revisiting in any case.
