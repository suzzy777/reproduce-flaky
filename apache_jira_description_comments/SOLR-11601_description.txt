Im switching my schemas from derprecated solr.LatLonType to solr.LatLonPointSpatialField.

Now my sortquery (which used to work with solr.LatLonType):

*sort=geodist(b4_location__geo_si,47.36667,8.55) asc*

raises the error

{color:red}*"sort param could not be parsed as a query, and is not a field that exists in the index: geodist(b4_location__geo_si,47.36667,8.55)"*{color}

Invoking sort using syntax 

{color:#14892c}sfield=b4_location__geo_si&pt=47.36667,8.55&sort=geodist() asc

works as expected though...{color}
