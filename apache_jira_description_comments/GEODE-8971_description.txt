When the gateway sender is stopped there is a high probability that batches with incomplete transactions are sent even if group-transaction-events is enabled.

The reason is that once the stop command reaches the gateway sender, it immediately stops queueing events, and this could happen in the middle of receiving events for the same transaction. If this is the case, some events for the transaction may have reached the queue right before the stop command was received and the rest of events for that transaction would not make it to the queue (they would be dropped) because they arrived right after the stop command was received at the gateway sender.
