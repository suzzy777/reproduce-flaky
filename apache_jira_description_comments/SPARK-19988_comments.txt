Attaching a trimmed version of the unit-test.log file, though nothing looks particularly notable in it to me.

also I tried running this test on my laptop in a loop, and it passed 100 times in a row.

It is probably some other test changing the current database to {{db2}}. This is super annoying to debug, and the only solution I see is that we fix the database names in the test.

With some help from [~joshrosen] I spent some time digging into this and found:

(1) if you look at the failures, they're all from the maven build.  In fact, 100% of the maven builds shown there fail (and none of the SBT ones).  This is weird because this is also failing on the PR builder, which uses SBT. 

(2) The maven build failures are all accompanied by 3 other tests; the group of 4 tests seems to consistently fail together.  3 tests fail with errors similar to this one (saying that some database does not exist).  The 4th test, org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveCatalogedDDLSuite: create temporary view using, fails with a more real error.  I filed SPARK-19990 for that issue.

(3) A commit right around the time the tests started failing: https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/09829be621f0f9bb5076abb3d832925624699fa9#diff-b7094baa12601424a5d19cb930e3402fR46 added code to remove all of the databases after each test.  I wonder if that's somehow getting run concurrently or asynchronously in the maven build (after the HiveCataloguedDDLSuite fails), which is why the error in the DDLSuite causes the other tests to fail saying that a database can't be found.  I have extremely limited knowledge of both (a) how the maven tests are executed and (b) the SQL code so it's possible these are totally unrelated issues.

None of this explains why the test is failing in the PR builder, where the failures have been isolated to this test.

Resolved by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17344 (which was merged with the wrong JIRA number, but should resolve this issue)

I might need to reopen it soon. We have a bug in the code, instead of the test case.
