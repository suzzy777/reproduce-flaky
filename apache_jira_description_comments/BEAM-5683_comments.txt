[~angoenka] I see you [previously worked on the [_populate_requirements_cache|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/5251] code. Can you help investigate this flake or find a more appropriate owner?

Looking at it.

As mentioned earlier, the test case seems to be failing because of pip.

 

pip is executed as a subprocess from python. Can we access pip subprocess logs?

[~pabloem] / [~robertwb] can either of you help out?

bq. Can we access pip subprocess logs?

I'll take a look in a bit

This failed again today: https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Py_VR_Dataflow/1303/

it's possible to get the output from the subprocess with `check_output` instead of `check_call`. We may also want to add retries to the command that fetches from pip...

I agree.

Shall we expose the pip logs?

I think exposing when failed should be ok.

check_output does that by default.

Another failure:

[~angoenka] ping

Can you please take a look?

This should be fixed after adding retry in [GitHub Pull Request #7043|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7043]

 

Please reopen if needed.
