An expected exception wasn't thrown in test_alloc_fail.py. It has happened twice recently.
The crash in the test infrastructure code is due to the fact that it's expecting {{test_section['CATCH']}} to be strings but it's in fact a list of strings. The flakiness in the test may be due to how the stress counter in {{free-pool.h}} is updated racily.
