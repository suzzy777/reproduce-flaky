I think these failed test cases are because of rootfs copy didn't complete in time.

Looks about right.  On most OS's, the copy seems to take ~0.5 seconds.  

{{LinuxFilesystemIsolatorTest.ROOT_ImageInVolumeWithRootFilesystem}}
On Centos7, it occasionally usually takes the full 2 minutes (it usually seems to take ~5 seconds):

I'll increase the timeout 2x.

    Increased the timeout in disk-heavy FilesystemIsolatorTests.
    
    Increases by 2x the amount of wait time in the
    `LinuxFilesystemIsolatorTest.ROOT_ImageInVolumeWithRootFilesystem` and
    `LinuxFilesystemIsolatorTest.ROOT_MultipleContainers` tests.
