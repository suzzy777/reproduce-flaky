In preparation to support Java 17 I would like to update ASM, ByteBuddy and Mockito on trunk.
 * ASM - from 9.1 to 9.3; From the [release notes|https://asm.ow2.io/versions.html] I don't see anything disturbing for us; 
 * ByteBuddy - 1.10.10 to 1.12.13; [Release notes|https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/blob/master/release-notes.md]; they support Java 17 since 1.12.0 but I did not see an issue updating to the latest version; 
 * Mockito - 3.2.4 to 4.7.0; [Release notes|https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases/]. The bump in the major version was due to removing outdated deprecated APIs which it doesn't seem that we use so this is not a breaking change for us.
