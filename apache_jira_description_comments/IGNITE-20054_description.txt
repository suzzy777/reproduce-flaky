*Motivation*

After https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-19506Â  was implemented some tests start to fail.

For example the test testScaleUpTimerIsRestoredAfterRestart use `blockUpdate` to prevent data nodes updating in the meta storage. Then it check the data nodes for the zone. But now dataNodes method returns nodes which even have not written to the meta storage. Because dataNodes use augmentation map. So I tried to fix this and similar tests by checking data nodes in metastorage, but after that this tests are flaky.

*Definition of Done*

Fix and enabled tests from ItIgniteDistributionZoneManagerNodeRestartTest.
