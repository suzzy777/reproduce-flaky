master used to be solid green. noticing that nowadays PRs and even some master merges fail with 

- No output received for 10m
- Exceeded runtime of 50m 
- VM exit crash 

We saw this earlier in the year as well. It was due to the apache org queue in travis being busy/stressed. I think we should shadow azure CI or circle CI parallely and weed out code vs environment issue.
