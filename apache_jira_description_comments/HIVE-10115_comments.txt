Removing fix version of 1.2.0 in preparation of release, since this is not a blocker for 1.2.0.

Attached a new patch to run all unit & integration tests on Jenkins as this patch is old.

Also, I removed the Configuration object to get the authentication string. There is already a HiveConf object that is passed to the constructor.

The JDBC spark tests that failed are not related to this patch. Seems that those tests are flaky. I looked at other jobs, and there are other JDBC spark test classes that fail in the same way.
I run this test in my machine and it works.

Another failed test, {{TestTxnCommands2}}, is not related to this patch either. It does not touch anything from HS2 authentication, and the failure is due to a NullPointerException that happens in getting transactions from the metastore.
I run this test in my machine and it works.

The other 2  tests failed in previous jobs as well.
I'll do a +1 to this patch.

[~xuefuz] Could you confirm that the Spark tests are not related?

It doesn't seem the spark failures are related to the patch. +1 on the patch as well.

Thanks [~mkazia] for your contribution. 
I submitted this patch to master, and it will appear on 2.1.0 version

Does this need to be documented in the wiki?  If so, please add a TODOC1.3 label.

Perhaps it belongs in one of these sections:

* [HiveServer2 Clients -- JDBC Client Setup for a Secure Cluster | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-JDBCClientSetupforaSecureCluster]
* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Advanced Features for Integration with Other Tools | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-AdvancedFeaturesforIntegrationwithOtherTools]
* [Setting Up HiveServer2 -- Authentication/Security Configuration | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Setting+Up+HiveServer2#SettingUpHiveServer2-Authentication/SecurityConfiguration]

Thanks [~leftylev]. The wiki contains the information needed. Our current documentation did not specify that LDAP+Kerberos were incompatible, so this patch fixes such bug. 


Okay, thanks Sergio.

Committed to branch-2.0 as well, now that it is open again, to be part of an eventual 2.0.1 if so.
