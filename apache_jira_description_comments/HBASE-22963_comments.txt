Looked at the code, seems in all the code path we will call cleanupConnection before dereference the NettyRpcConnection...

Maybe something wrong when shutting down the rpc client. Let me dig more.

OK, I think the problem is cancelConnections...

Let me provide a patch...

Pushed to branch-2.1+.

Thanks [~stack] for reviewing.
