Change [1] introduced user attributes for various thin clients. {{control.sh|bat}} script uses {{GridClient}} to connect to cluster, but it's impossible to set user attributes in corresponding {{GridClientConfiguration}} currenly. I suggest to add {{.properties}} file support, so that user attributes could be set in a file specified by {{--user-attrs-file /path/to/filename.properties}} as {{attrName=attrValue}} lines.
