[~agura] could you take a look?

[~dmekhanikov], [~agura], is it actual?

[~amashenkov] It still looks reasonable to me.

I resolved the conflicts in the PR. Should be good to merge. The failing tests clearly can't be a result of changed comments.

[~agura], could you help with a review/merge? Here's the PR: https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/9432

[~nizhikov], maybe you can take a look? 

[~nizhikov], thanks for the review! I fixed your comments.

Could you help with a merge?
