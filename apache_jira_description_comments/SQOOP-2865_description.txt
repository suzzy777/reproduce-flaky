Our integration tests are currently running with [one hour timeout|https://github.com/apache/sqoop/blob/sqoop2/pom.xml#L796]. That seems fine on my laptop, but Apache build slaves seems to be slower and the build is quite frequently timing out. I don't see a need to limit the number of tests as I would much rather have better quality then faster tests, so I would like to propose to increase the timeout.
