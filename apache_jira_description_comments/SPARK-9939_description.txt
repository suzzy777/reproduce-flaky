The following SQL test suites fork subprocesses and have been flaky for quite a while and fail now and then due to mysterious timeouts:

- {{CliSuite}}
- {{HiveThriftBinaryServerSuite}}
- {{HiveSparkSubmitSuite}}
- {{HiveThriftHttpServerSuite}}

One of the possible reasons of this is a known bug of Scala process API  ([SI-8768|https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8768]). Resorting to Java process API may possibly fix these flaky tests.
