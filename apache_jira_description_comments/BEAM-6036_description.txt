I have followed the example provided here [https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/guide-to-common-cloud-dataflow-use-case-patterns-part-1]Â in the "Pattern: Slowly-changing lookup cache" section. I've converted the pseudo-code from the article into this Java code:


return p
.apply("GenerateSequence", GenerateSequence.from(0).withRate(1, Duration.standardHours(1)))
 .apply("GenerateSequenceWindow",
 Window.<Long>into(new GlobalWindows()).triggering(
 Repeatedly.forever(AfterProcessingTime.pastFirstElementInPane()))
 .discardingFiredPanes())
 .apply("RetrieveKVs",
 ParDo.of(new RetrieveKVs()))
 .apply("ToMap", View.asMap());

RetrieveKVs() queries BigQuery table and outputs KVs. 

The issue here is that the resulting map mixes up KVs from different periods (i.e. the sequence is generated every 1 hour, the resulting map includes KVs from 2 adjacent hours).

In an attempt to solve it I tried using View.asSingleton() instead.

        return p
            .apply("GenerateSequence", GenerateSequence.from(0).withRate(1, Duration.standardHours(1)))
            .apply("GenerateSequenceWindow",
                Window.<Long>into(new GlobalWindows()).triggering(
                    Repeatedly.forever(AfterProcessingTime.pastFirstElementInPane()))
                    .discardingFiredPanes())
            .apply("RetrieveMap",
                ParDo.of(new RetrieveMap()))
            .apply("ToMap", View.asSingleton());

RetrieveMap queries data from BigQuery and outputs the complete map. The issue with this is it not only results in flaky tests with the exception 1 times out of 10:

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Empty PCollection accessed as a singleton view. Consider setting withDefault to provide a def
ault value

but also it doesn't seem to work. In the logs I see the RetrieveMap is called every hour, but the pipeline using the side input gets stale data. 

Is there a real working example for how to make a side input refresh periodically?
