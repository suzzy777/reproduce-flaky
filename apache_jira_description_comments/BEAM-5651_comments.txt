This test task started at [2018-10-04 4:00:11am PDT|https://scans.gradle.com/s/bfqknnt245izk/console-log?task=:beam-runners-spark:runQuickstartJavaSpark] (roughly 10/4 11am UTC) and ran for [2m 20.296s|https://scans.gradle.com/s/bfqknnt245izk/timeline?task=locjwcrjlbjlg]. 

I don't see any artifacts in [maven central|https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/beam/beam-model-fn-execution/2.8.0-SNAPSHOT/] with similar timestamps, so I don't think this is a  timing issue for the snapshot currently being generated.
