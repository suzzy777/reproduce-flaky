There are a few tests now that fails, they should maybe be moved

Also add a note to the 3.10 upgrade guide, you can find it in the docs folder

[~davsclaus] , the failing tests mentioned are actually flaky ones that are not linked to this commit.
 I would suspect a kind of race condition where concurrent running tests using "System.setProperty(XPathFactory.DEFAULT_PROPERTY_NAME..." are mixing up.
 However, I was not able to find any evidence, nor a fix.

Back to this ticket, I'm proposing an [update|https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/5605] of the 3.11 upgrade guide. I don't this there is community interest in backporting to 3.10 ?

No backport.

Okay about those unit tests, ah yeah if JVM system properties are changed then they can't run in parallel tests etc. 
I think junit5 has some kind of annotation to mark a test as non-parallel.

The removal of the useless dependency is solved [here|https://github.com/apache/camel/commit/3b3a9a00e401b97a17fcacf3d52c3af3969f2927].

The migration guide has been updated [here|https://github.com/apache/camel/commit/1fd27b28bf6890fe4f5724653d61ec1bcee6aa51].
