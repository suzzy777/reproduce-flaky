Removed Fix Version 2.2.1 as this issue is not blocking that release.

Since this is not a blocker issue, as part of the 2.6.0 release process I'm changing the fix version to `2.6.1` and `2.7.0`. If this is incorrect, please respond and discuss on the "[DISCUSS] Apache Kafka 2.6.0 release" discussion mailing list thread.

No failures reported for this in over a year. As part of the 2.7.0 release process, I'm optimistically closing this ticket. If another failure occurs, we can re-open.
