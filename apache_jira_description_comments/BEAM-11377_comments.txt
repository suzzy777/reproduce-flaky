One solution may be to simply retry more via {{-Dmaven.wagon.http.retryHandler.count=5}}

Perhaps a better solution is to not wipe out the local repository. This means we need {{.m2}} to live outside the wiped area of the workspace (this is safe as it is a transparent cache of immutable things) and also need to change [this line|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/3de140f908295706bb3bf0e8bd42630c1ed815f1/release/src/main/groovy/TestScripts.groovy#L199] which sets it to a subdirectory of a deleted temp dir.

It would be fine to cache all the dependencies and not wipe the local repository, but I expect the snapshot jars, like .m2/repository/org/apache/beam/beam-sdks-java-core/2.27.0-SNAPSHOT/beam-sdks-java-core-2.27.0-SNAPSHOT.jar should not be cached, if possible.

Since the workspace is wiped when the job finished, how about a workspace-local .m2 repo?

The workspace-local {{.m2}} wouldn't have any effect if it is wiped.

Snapshots are not an issue. They are not published under names like {{beam-sdks-java-core-2.27.0-SNASHOT.jar}}. They are published with dated jars like {{beam-sdks-java-core-2.27.0-20201210.070217-43.jar}} (see https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/beam/beam-sdks-java-core/2.27.0-SNAPSHOT/). The maven flag {{--update-snapshots}} forces a check to see if there is a newer one.

Oddly, in the console log it seems that we pass that flag for {{mvn archetype:generate}} but not for {{mvn compile exec:java}}.

Kenn, who could look into this? Is this a flake or a permanent failure?

Seems like a flake, since it passed most recently. Unless someone fixed it.

This test seems to be failing quite often. I have not looked at the recent failures and I am not sure the if the root cause is the same. But it will be worth fixing this.

5 retries reduced the problem but it is still failing. Only 1 of the tasks failed this last run as opposed to 5 of them.

Disabled httpkeepalive, so far the last execution passed successfully. I'll close this issue for now and reopen if there is a regression again.

Still failing. Going to try disabling the wagon keepalive next.

Alright! Tests passing now.
