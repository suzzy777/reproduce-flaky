Would you mind taking a look, [~kuaw26] ? 

[~sdarlington] Not sure that we should fix this.
According to this: https://superuser.com/questions/169051/whats-the-difference-between-c-and-d-for-unix-mac-os-x-terminal
 Ctrl+C - means “interrupt”, i.e., stop what you're doing.
 Ctrl+D - means end of file.
So, why we need to support Ctrl+D?
VisorCmd is not a linux Utility - it is a 'sh' script that starts a program in JVM.
So it looks for me that bash and|or JVM do not support "Ctrl+D".

[~kuaw26], it already _does_ support ^D. It only fails if you're connected to a cluster when you press it. Why should ^D only work sometimes?

Also, visor is as much a Unix utility as, say, the Scala REPL or Python, both of which support ^D. My guess is they also support ^Z when run in Windows, which is the convention on that platform.

[~sdarlington] After looking around, I found this issue: "Customizable Ctrl-D handling #201" https://github.com/jline/jline2/issues/201
There 2 possible workarounds: 
 1. Handle EOFException (see org.apache.ignite.visor.visor#readLineOpt)
 2. Update to jline3. Current version is jline 2.12.1 (may help without fixing code, but may be incompatible with VisorCmd current code)

The attached patch ([GitHub Pull Request #6877|https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/6877]) offers a third way: when it falls out of the main loop, disconnect from the cluster if it's connected.

[~sdarlington] Looks good to me.

Can you provide TC results and can we proceed with the merge?

Is there anything else I need to do to help get this merged?

Not sure what the status of this ticket should be, but it _is_ in [2.10|https://github.com/apache/ignite/blob/ignite-2.10/modules/visor-console/src/main/scala/org/apache/ignite/visor/commands/VisorConsole.scala#L258], [~mmuzaf], so I switched the tag back.

Thanks, I've missed that. So, can we resolve the issue?
