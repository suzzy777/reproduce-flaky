I get this error sometimes:
DataflowAssertException: Failed assert: 3.150432 not in [3.130000, 3.150000] [while running 'assert_that/Match']
root: WARNING: A task failed with exception.
 Failed assert: 3.150432 not in [3.130000, 3.150000] [while running 'assert_that/Match']

This is probably related to the reduced trial size, We can relax the upper/lower bounds a little bit.
