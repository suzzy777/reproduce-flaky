Currently the [ParquetRecordWriter|https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/a98da39dd5a8fa368afd8765f4e981826bbfcc0f/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/parquet/ParquetRecordWriter.java] receives one record at a time and then turns that into columns.
Which means we convert from Drill columns to rows and then to Parquet columns.
Instead we could directly convert the Drill columns into Parquet columns in a vectorized manner.
