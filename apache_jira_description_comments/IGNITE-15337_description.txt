 ODBC ssl tests randomly (ubuntu 20.04) or constantly (win 10) fails on openssl 1.1.1k with failed handshake. 
On openssl without tls 1.3 support all works flawlessly.

WA: disable TLS 1.3 on ignite side 
{code}
-Djdk.tls.server.protocols=TLSv1.2
{code}

It will be also great to implement an ability to set TLS version on C++,  nowadays default one is choosen.
