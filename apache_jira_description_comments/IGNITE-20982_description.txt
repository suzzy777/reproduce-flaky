The following rules help with javadoc comments
{code}
<module name="JavadocStyle"/>
<module name="JavadocMissingWhitespaceAfterAsterisk"/>
{code}
Apart from that we want to check the style of ordinary java comments (start with //).
Common rule: 
- A space between // and the beginning of a sentence
- The sentence starts with a capital letter.
- The sentence/paragraph ends with a period.
