Our Hadoop module can interact with IGFS in several ways:
1) Over TCP (Linux, Windows).
2) Over shmem (Linux only).
Actual mode is selected based on file system URL.

We need to ensure that both modes work fine at the moment. Some unit tests sohuld already exists for this. We must ensure that they cover both cases.
