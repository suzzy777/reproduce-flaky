Stack trace only shows verification failed, whereas what we want to know about is the stack trace of origin issue (java.lang.StackOverflowError here).

[~dongjoon] Would Jenkins store unit-test.log files for modules per build somewhere? I guess some tests are really hard to find the origin reason without log file, so I wish we have it somewhere.

Maybe, [~shaneknapp] knows that~

[~dongjoon] Ah yes, I guess you have been dealing with build system recently so thought you know this. Thanks for forwarding!

ARGH i just messed up and accidentally overwrote all of these logs.  :(

i'll retrigger a build and if it happens again let me know here and we can investigate fully.  i'm not really sure what's happening, as i'm not a java/scala experten, and other pull request builds are successfully running on this worker.  the system configs for these machines hasn't changed in a long time, either.

hmm, i see that https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25901 has been merged in.

Thank you for investigation, [~shaneknapp]. Yes. I merged that PR because I though it's irrelevant to this flakiness. Do you want to re-trigger on that PR? Then, sorry about that~

Since I'm monitoring Jenkins jobs, I'll ping you if I see this failure again.

it's ok...  let's try and keep an eye on these tests for other PRs and see if it pops up again.

Could we expose a way to store these unit-test.log files in all modules to somewhere, like build artifacts? For example, see files under "container 0" in this page: [https://circleci.com/gh/HeartSaVioR/spark-state-tools/68#artifacts/containers/0]

I understand Amplab CI runs plenty of builds so space might be matter - they would be mostly only needed for failed builds. Zipped file would be also OK - even better than nothing.

I think we can close this as with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31363 the exception is extended with the stack trace of the stuck thread and by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31397 a fix is provided.

I agree with you, [~attilapiros].
