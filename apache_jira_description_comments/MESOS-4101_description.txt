Presently, some tests pause the clock before they do timing-sensitive operations, only calling explicitly {{Clock::advance()}} to help ensure that dependencies on the clock don't cause the test to be non-deterministic. (Using {{Clock::advance()}} is typically also faster than waiting for the equivalent amount of physical time to elapse.)

However, most tests do not pause the clock, which contributes to the ongoing flakiness witnessed in many tests. We should investigate whether it is feasible to pause the clock in all/most tests (e.g., have the clock paused by default), and only enable the clock when the test cannot be implemented with {{Clock::advance()}}, {{Clock::settle()}}, and similar functions.
