[~vozerov], [~al.psc], who can take a look to these failures?

[~vozerov], do you mind removing Dynamic*Test suites from Queries 2 run? Seems this failures are not important as there is no response.

[~dpavlov], we should not remove or mute these tests. While being flaky, they still pass in the most cases and test important piece of functionallity.

[~vozerov], then is it ok to exclude queries 2 from run-all and from monitoring process?

whole suite can't pass because of these tests.
