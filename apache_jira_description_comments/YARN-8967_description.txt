The PlacementRule interface was introduced to be used by all schedulers as per YARN-3635. The CapacityScheduler is using it but the FairScheduler is not and is using its own rule definition.

YARN-8948 cleans up the implementation and removes the CS references which should allow this change to go through.
This would be the first step in using one placement rule engine for both schedulers.
