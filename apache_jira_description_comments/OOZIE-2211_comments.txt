failing test is unrelated, passes locally.

Thanks for the contribution [~dbist13]!

As {{TestV2ValidateServlet}} and {{TestOozieCLI#testValidateWorkflowCommand()}} both test {{V2ValidateServlet#doPost()}}, I suggest to remove {{TestValidation}} in its entirety instead of having it there doing no real work.

[~dbist13] having looked at a wrong patch. +1 for patch 002.

Committed to {{master}}. Thanks for the contribution [~dbist13]!

Closing issue; Oozie 5.1.0 is released.
