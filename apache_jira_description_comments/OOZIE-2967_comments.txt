This test has an interesting problem: even though certain services are excluded in {{setUp()}}, the {{Service}} object is re-created and re-initialized in the test. It means that {{StatusTransitService}} will be started which sometimes interferes with the test.

There's also a completely unnecessary {{sleep(1000);}}.

[~gezapeti] [~andras.piros] please check the patch.

It is sometimes necessary to re-initialize the Services within a test. It's not a good practice though - we should create new test classes in these cases.
