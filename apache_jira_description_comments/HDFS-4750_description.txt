Access HDFS is usually done through HDFS Client or webHDFS. Lack of seamless integration with clientâ€™s file system makes it difficult for users and impossible for some applications to access HDFS. NFS interface support is one way for HDFS to have such easy integration.

This JIRA is to track the NFS protocol support for accessing HDFS. With HDFS client, webHDFS and the NFS interface, HDFS will be easier to access and be able support more applications and use cases. 

We will upload the design document and the initial implementation.
