    Fixed flakiness of resource provider ContainerTerminationMetric test.
    
    Plugin restarts can currently fail if the resource provider is killed
    before it has performed minimal reconciliation steps. This patch adds
    additional synchronization to ensure the plugin container can safely be
    killed to safely perform the desired test.

Fixed flakiness of resource provider ContainerTerminationMetric test.

While we addressed one source of flakiness of this test in
`2117f671c450d7c74edc53078e8c0ed6035020aa` we introduced a new source of
flakiness (agents send more than the expected number of
`UpdateSlaveMessage`s since they failed a timeout in registration with
the master).

This patch ensures that the agent registers successfully before
continuing with the test.
