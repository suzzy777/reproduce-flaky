Please ignore. I tested against the wrong version of ZooKeeper and this was resolved by ZOOKEEPER-1653

-We have noticed on internal executions of the integration tests rare failures of org.apache.zookeeper.test.CnxManagerTest.testWorkerThreads.-

{code}
java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to run quorum server 
	at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer.loadDataBase(QuorumPeer.java:565)

	at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer.loadDataBase(QuorumPeer.java:546)
{code}

-along with this strange stack trace in the logs:-
{code}
java.nio.channels.ClosedByInterruptException

	at sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl.force(FileChannelImpl.java:380)

{code}

-It appears that this failure is related to the usage of {{((FileOutputStream) out).getChannel().force(true)}} in {{AtomicFileOutputStream}}. {{FileChannel#force}} appears to be interruptible, which is not desirable behavior when writing the epoch file. The interrupt may be triggered by the repeated starting and shutting down of quorum peers in {{testWorkerThreads}}. Branch 3.5 uses {{FileDescriptor#sync}} which is not interruptible and does not appear to have the same problem.-

-I was able to find another JIRA ticket describing a similar issue here:' https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-4963-

-There is also interesting discussion in ZOOKEEPER-1835 (where the change was made for 3.5) although these discussions appear to be Windows centric (we noticed the issue on Linux)-https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1835

-The failure appears to have popped up on "ZOOKEEPER-2297 PreCommit Build #3241" but jenkins cleared out the logs (I only still have the test report from the mailing list).-

-In addition, {{testWorkerThreads}} appears to be failing every few months on Solaris on Apache Jenkins (for 3.4 ZooKeeper_branch34_solaris - Build # 1430  and 3.5 ZooKeeper_branch35_solaris - Build # 387), but at the time I wrote this Jenkins had cleaned out the logs from the latest failed run so I have no way of determining if the cause is the same.-
