I can occasionally reproduce this, with the additional error {{assertion failed: 0 == pthread_setspecific(tls->key, (void*)value)}} that should have been fixed in ARROW-7689. Maybe we should mark the TLS tests as flakes (on OSX only?) since it seems gRPC itself struggles with this platform.

Yes, I think we can do that (skip the TLS tests on macOS). It would also be worthwhile to report the two issues to gRPC.

For the record, the "Handshaker factory creation failed" error log is a red herring, it's displayed even in successful runs.
The real issue is the crash.
