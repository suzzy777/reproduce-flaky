moved things out to 1.5.2 in jira.

current flaky looks unacceptable:

https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-1/564/artifact/dashboard.html

In paticular {{TestMasterNoCluster}} and {{TestCatalogJanitor}} are failing all the time.

tracked those down to HBASE-23185 and reverted it. both tests now pass locally. started some flaky test runs  to confirm.

both tests look solid now since the revert.

based on this thread:

https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/cc66ce601a0bcd4fc809139f3f79f63607ee9f5bb4dcffcb1a92b2e6@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E

I'm going to repurpose this for relesing 1.6.0. If anyone wants a 1.5.1 please feel free, but start a new jira.

Taking this over, thanks [~busbey]

Unit tests generally look good. Some of the rsgroup tests time out but this is a known issue when they are executed in parallel with each other. 

Please add the release data here? So it will be easy for generating the board reports...

Haven't seen 1.5.0+ releases on the list...
