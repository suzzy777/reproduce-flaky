Can you elaborate? HBase provides an option for structured keys w/type support and correct multi-field ordering (as of 0.96 IIRC, [~ndimiduk] might know more).
Using these, if they fit the use case, might be nice for both sides (they are already there so no new code, and this will provide the real use case for them).
We (ok, at least myself) can volunteer to fix things quickly to make it work :)

Hi Sergey,

This bug is similar to other two bugs[1][2] that I logged to get an out-of-the-box support for querying structs stored in HBase. The other two issues mainly deal with supporting protobufs, thrift and avros which can be deeply nested while this one was for simple structs that don't fall in either category (fix being pretty similar to one suggested in HIVE-2599). I kind of already have something which is working but I can completely throw it away if we can come up with a better strategy. :)

[2] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6147

How is this not a duplicate of HIVE-3211?

I think it would be trivial to create Avro and Protobuf implementations of [{{org.apache.hadoop.hbase.types.DataType}}|https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/hbase-0.96.0/hbase-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/types/DataType.java]. The details will be similar to what's already provided in [{{Struct}}|https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/hbase-0.96.0/hbase-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/types/Struct.java] (which I suggested you examine over in HIVE-2599). If you build on top of that interface, all HBase users will benefit from from you code, not just Hive + HBase users.

Patch attached.

[~brocknoland][~xuefuz] If you guys get a chance to review this, I would highly appreciate that. The above one test failure is unrelated to my patch.

Thank you! Comments on RB.

Thanks for the review [~brocknoland]. Addressed comments and patch updated.

The above test failure is unrelated to the change.

Patch looks good and I am +1, but I still see:

which doesn't seem to make sense?

I had actually added that to ensure that the deserialization stuff goes along fine because that was a statement which seemed to be called on select * style of queries. In the latest patch, added assertions around SerDeUtils.getJSONString

The failed test seems flaky and unrelated to my changes here.

+1

Thank you very much Swarnim! I have committed this to trunk!
