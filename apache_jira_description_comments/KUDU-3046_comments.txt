KUDU-3046: deflake TabletServerQuiescingITest

The test was flaky for a number of reasons including:
- Slowness in TSAN mode along with a low Raft timeout meant workloads
  would fail to even create tablets.
  - Addressed this by increasing the heartbeat interval in TSAN mode.
- Not hitting the exact number of scanners when running the tool because
  of a TOCTOU race between checking the number of scanners and running
  the tool.
  - Addressed this by reducing the number of read threads and thus
    reducing the degrees of freedom with which the tool can run (either
    0 scanners or 1 scanner).
- TestAbruptStepdownWhileAllQuiescing failed because the test would step
  down a leader without the guarantee that it was the latest leader, so
  a leader could still exist even after stepping down.
  - Addressed this by stepping down on all tablet servers just to be
    sure, and retrying if necessary via ASSERT_EVENTUALLY.

There appears to be another source of flakiness that are less specific
to this test, but this dropped flakiness from failing 4/100 to failing
9/2000 (all due to a TSAN issue in the TestWorkload that I'm still
getting to the bottom of).
