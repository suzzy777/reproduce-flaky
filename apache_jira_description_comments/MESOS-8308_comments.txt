This has gone from flaky to failing consistently.

+1, failing consistently on my updated/new review requests.

Fix submitted in Code Review #66415.  Changed the test from using powershell Start-Sleep to using ping.

    Windows: Changed `SLEEP_COMMAND` to use `ping`.

    We have gone back to `ping` as the `sleep` command on Windows, because
    PowerShell is too slow to startup, and can crash when the machine is
    overloaded. This time, however, the output of `ping` is redirected to
    `NUL` so that the tests aren't spammed with spurious output when
    sleeping.
