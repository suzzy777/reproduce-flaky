Now Gavin from the infra team has already set up one machine called hbase1 and can only take jobs from the 'HBase'.

Let me switch one job first to see if it works. If everything is fine, will soon allocate the other 9 machines so we could migrate more jobs.

Will migrate more jobs when he remain nodes are avaiable.

We have 10 machines now.

https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/label/hbase/

Let me move more jobs.

In general, since we are still allowed to use the Hadoop nodes, I plan to leave the main pre commit job on Hadoop node for now, until we have more nodes for hbase only.

And  for other jobs, I think we could make the flaky tests run more aggressively? In the past it was every 4 hours and then increased to 12 hours because we are warned by the infra team...

Makes sense!

All works are done.

Thanks all for helping!
