https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/741992238 for https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1494 failed with:

SavingsWorkbookPopulateTest > testSavingsWorkbookPopulate() FAILED
    java.lang.AssertionError: 1 expectation failed.
    Expected status code <200> but was <500>.

I suspect that is NOT due to a change in that PR, but that test is just "flaky".
