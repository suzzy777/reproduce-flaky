I have found that on certain machines (in my case, on a 32-core machine but not on an 8-core machine), {{session-expiry-test}} is flaky if no minicluster is running. We tend to expect backend tests like this one to not require the minicluster, but in Jenkins runs, I believe the minicluster is running, hiding this flakiness.

Oddly, I found adding {{--alsologtostderr}} to the test to make it fail more reliably, on my machine. If you don't specify {{--alsologtostderr}} it mostly runs fine.

Here's the quick log:
{code}
$ be/build/debug/service/session-expiry-test --alsologtostderr
...

{code}

I've not looked into it deeply, but naively it looks like on a slower machine, the test finishes before its impala server class has a chance to talk to HDFS.

I've attached the full log output from successful and unsuccessful runs.
