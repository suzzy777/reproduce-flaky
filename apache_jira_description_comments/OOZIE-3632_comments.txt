Hey [~medb]

thank you for your change. Can we use OOZIE-3599 instead of this one. I saw you cloned OOZIE-3599 but I think the cleaner approach would be to change the original's title and work on that. I happily add you to the contributor list of the Jira. :) 

One more thing: [https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-project/pom.xml#L40] As Oozie is a component in Hadoop ecosystem what do you think about having the same version of dependencies which Hadoop has?

 

If you agree I am closing this Jira as a duplicate and change the title of the OOZIE-3599. Please let me know your thoughts.

 

Thanks,

Denes

Hey [~dionusos],

I cloned OOZIE-3599 just because I can not attach patch files to OOZIE-3599 and kick off CI on them, so to test my changes somehow I cloned OOZIE-3599 (GitHub PRs also lack CI integration).

If there a way to give me permission to submit patches to OOZIE-3599 then this will be ideal and I will not need this Jira.

Sure, I can use the same Jetty version as Hadoop uses.

Hi [~medb]

thanks for your answer. I added you to the contributors group. Could you please try attaching path to OOZIE-3599? If yes, then I'll close this Jira.

Thanks,

Denes

[~dionusos], thanks, I can attach patches to OOZIE-3599 and I have closed this issue as its duplicate.
