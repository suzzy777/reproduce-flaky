[~fhussonnois] Do you have any plans to pick this up soon? I would rather make sure that the Scala API does not lag too much compared to the Java API (in fact, it would be best to keep in in-sync in every release...)

Since this is not a blocker issue, as part of the 2.6.0 release process I'm changing the fix version to `2.7.0`. If this is incorrect, please respond and discuss on the "[DISCUSS] Apache Kafka 2.6.0 release" discussion mailing list thread.

Not a blocker issue so as part of the 2.7.0 release I'm clearing the fix version.  When we have a PR for this ticket we can set the appropriate fix version then.

can't find the "submit patch" button, so ... ping [~mjsax]

Thanks for the PR [~mathieude] – you could not see the button, because you were not added to the contributor list yet (just added you, and assigned the ticket; you can now also self assign).

Btw: in general, you should first assign a ticket to yourself before you start working on it – otherwise, two people might work on the same thing what would be a waste of time. :) 

Thanks.
Patch is ready, but some of the builds are red for reasons that are not related to this change. Not sure how to move forward (sorry, kind of newbie-contributor question :-D )

Don't worry about flaky tests. We will try to review your PR shortly. – Kafka is a very busy project and it sometimes takes some time until we get to review PRs. Thanks for your understanding, and feel free to nag us again if it takes too long and nothing happens.
