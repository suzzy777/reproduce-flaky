IMPALA-10783: Fixed flakiness in run_and_verify_query_cancellation_test

The issue was that after the impala-shell is started in a seperate
process and an error is encountered then the process lingers on
and a long running query can hold on to resources and potentially
affect other tests running on the impala cluster.
This patch just makes sure that the impala-shell process is killed
regardless of any errors encountered.
