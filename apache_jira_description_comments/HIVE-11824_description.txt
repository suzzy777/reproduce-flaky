While running tez_insert_overwrite_local_directory_1.q test under tez and llap, the results were flaky. The reason being insert into local directory copies .staging directory to destination directory. This causes dfs -cat dest-dir/* to fail, failing the tests. Non local insert directory works fine as MoveTask performs move operation with hidden files removal filter before moving whereas local directory insert uses DFS.copyToLocalFile without hidden files filter.
