* In the class name can you correct "Programm" to "Program"
* When you initialize arrays, can you use the abbreviated form "Foo[] foos = \{ ... ]}" rather than "Foo[] foos = new Foo[] \{ ... \}".
* I do think you should add it to the standard suite, even now while things are flaky. Because if code is not run then it breaks. Run it with a fixed seed and (small) iteration count so that there are no failures.
* I think you should remove the class name from the commit message. It is possible to describe the test in terms that someone who has not read the code would understand.
