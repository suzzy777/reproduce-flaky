In the root pom we define {{hadoop.version}} and use this for several hadoop artifacts. The version is not defined for {{hadoop-yarn-registry}} so if we compile Oozie with {{-Dhive.version=2.1.0 -Dhadoop.version=2.8.5}} most of the hadoop jars will use version 2.8.5, but {{hadoop-yarn-registry}} will use version 2.7.1 Let's harmonize this.
