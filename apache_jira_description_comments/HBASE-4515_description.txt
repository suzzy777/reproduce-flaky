When testing with miniclusters that shutdown and are restarted, sometimes a call to User.getCurrent().getName() NPEs when attempting to restart hbase.  Oddly this happens consistently on particular branches and not on others. I don't know or understand why this happens but it has something to do with the getCurrentUGI call in  o.a.h.h.security.User.HadoopUser sometimes returning null and sometimes returning data.

{code}
   private HadoopUser() {
      try {
        ugi = (UserGroupInformation) callStatic("getCurrentUGI");
        if (ugi == null) {
          LOG.warn("Although successfully retrieved UserGroupInformation" 
              + "  it was null!");
        }
      } catch (RuntimeException re) {
{code}

This patch essentially is a workaround -- it propagates the null so that clients can check and avoid the NPE.
