This may be caused by IMPALA-4063. In particular, the coordinator fragment instance didn't complete until the query handle is explicitly closed and the query is unregistered because the test didn't pull any of the results. In which case, other completed fragment instances running on the coordinator may not have their latest profiles recorded in the backend state until the query state thread wakes up to send them every {{--report_status_retry_interval_ms}}. By default, that period is 5 seconds. Before IMPALA-4063, the completed fragment instance will independently send the fragment instance's profile upon its own completion. It's a conscious decision in IMPALA-4063 to batch all fragments' profiles together.

IMPALA-7852: Fix some flakiness in test_hash_join_timer.py

test_hash_join_timer.py aims to verify the timers in the
join nodes are functioning correctly. It does so by parsing
the query profile for certain patterns after the query has
finished.

Before IMPALA-4063, each individual fragment instance will
post its profile to the coordinator upon completion. After
IMPALA-4063, the profiles of all fragment instances are sent
together periodically and the final profile is sent once all
fragment instances on a backend are done.

The problem with the existing implementation of the test is
that it doesn't actually fetch results before closing the
query. As a result of it, the coordinator fragment never gets
a chance to complete as it will block forever when inserting
into the plan root sink. The lack of completion of the
coordinator fragment causes the final profiles of fragment
instances on the coordinator to be not sent before the query
is closed. As a result, the profile of a fragment instance
on the coordinator could be stale if it completes between
two periodic updates, leading to random test failure.

This change fixes the flankiness by always fetching results
before closing the query. Ideally, if we fix IMPALA-539 and
wait for all backends' final profiles before completing query
unregistration, we should get the final profile from the
coordinator fragment too.
