[~krishaudt14] There's very little/no value in tickets like these. We run CI for every PR, every merged commit, and nightly builds, and test instabilities are logged. If we can't reproduce this in our CI, then let's not spend time on these tickets but focus on the other open tickets. I'm closing this as Can't Reproduce since this requires an additional plugin to be reproduced, which we aren't using in Flink. 

Hi Martijn : I can understand that currently this problem is not exposed in the CI, because this kind of 80% problem we detected exposed mainly because the change of the test environment (and more dangerous for lower-version JDK), while for the CI the test environment won't change. In detail, ~50% of problem we address is because the non-deterministic of the Hash (Set and Map), this is one example Apache repo [wicket|https://github.com/apache/wicket/commit/ed64e166dcba6715eafcbb7ca460d2b87e84cffc] had encountered and addressed, this is kind of problem resolved for the long-term gain :) . Here is a list of this kind of this problem : https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/idoft

[~hannahchi] Looking at the number of open tickets with actually reported test instabilities, I don't see why adding more tickets that don't have a direct reproducer is valuable for the project. It just creates noise for the maintainers who are already trying their best to keep Flink in a good shape

[~hannahchi] I feel like you're not actually responding to my comment, but just trying to convince me/the community that we should use your tool. I'm more then happy to have a meaningful discussion, but I don't think that's currently happening so I'll refrain from commenting, but I will close more tickets if they follow the same paradigm as I've seen recently. 

Okay! have a good day! :D
