Before IMPALA-9655 scan ranges were statically assigned to intra-node fragment instances based on Longest-Processing Time algorithm:

From IMPALA-9655 we use dynamic intra-node load balancing for HDFS scans. It means fragment instances have a shared queue of scan ranges and the fragment instances grab the next scan range to be read from this queue.

IMPALA-9655 got rid of the LPT-algorithm which means  the scan ranges are in a random order in the queue. This can lead to a skew if there are large scan ranges at the end.

We could mix the above two by using a priority queue for the scan ranges, so each fragment instance would grab the largest scan range in the queue. This could further mitigate intra-node skewing.
