I understand from the discussion that this is a feature rather than an unwanted side effect of giving time for application to create childrens, and I won't dispute that.

What led to reporting this is a problem we encountered when using Curator's {{PersistentTtlNode}} that creates a container and adds a child to it, but doesn't do it as a transaction.

So I'll address this issue in Curator.

I believe this should be solved in the server. I have an idea for a backward compatible way of handling this. PR coming soon.
