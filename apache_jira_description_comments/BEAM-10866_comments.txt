Raised priority to P1 per priority guide.

This happened again on macos/py3.8 in https://github.com/apache/beam/runs/1094299629

Note in that case it occurred in FnApiRunnerTestWithGrpc

[~ajamato@google.com] could you take a look at this? It looks you added test_register_finalization in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8062

This was hit again here: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12656/checks?check_run_id=1114521792

I am seeing this in a precommit as well.

 

https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_PVR_Flink_Commit/605/testReport/junit/apache_beam.runners.portability.flink_runner_test/FlinkRunnerTestStreaming/test_register_finalizations/

(noticed this was assigned to me, i dont recognize this, and the PR seems to just move the test around within the file, so the blame history is a bit incorrect here).

Looks to me though, like this test is trying to finalize a bundle with a few elements and record this. So possibly processing is flakey and the elements are not making it to finalization, or the element recorder has a bug.

Sorry Alex! It looks like this test was actually added by [~boyuanz] in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7937 

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-11070 seems to duplicate this as well.

The description for BEAM-11070 seems to indicate the flake is Flink specific, but we're seeing this on the fn api runner as well
