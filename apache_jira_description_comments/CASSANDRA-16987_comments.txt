+1, tested with 3.10.

Hey [~Bowen Song], thank you for reporting the issue and submitting a patch!

To help you, I submitted Jenkins dev CI run for you [here|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1141/]

[~e.dimitrova] Thank you. I can see the test result is 7 failures (+4) , 960 skipped (-36). However I don't see how is this change in any way possible to have any effect on the failed tests:
{quote}org.apache.cassandra.distributed.upgrade
org.apache.cassandra.net
dtest.scrub_test
dtest-upgrade.upgrade_tests.upgrade_through_versions_test
dtest-novnode.scrub_test{quote}

I clicked open some of these failed tests, and it appears to be something totally irrelevant to the changes made in the commit, for example, org.apache.cassandra.distributed.upgrade.CompactStorageUpgradeTest.compactStorageUpgradeTest failed because java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded.

Are these just flaky tests? Were they broken before my change? How do I know if any is caused by my change?

 

[~Bowen Song] all valid questions and comments. Let me clarify a bit.

I submitted your patch to Jenkins dev which is accessible for testing patches pre-commit by PMC and committers. In that sense the comparison you see is to other patches tested there and not to the official [Jenkins post-commit builds history|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/]. What we do is comparing to the post-commit builds whether we introduced something new or there is history around some of the tests If we are not sure whether the test was broken by us or not. We also look at already opened tickets for tests issues - [this Jira filter|https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12350869], linked by Josh in one of the [project updates|https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r681bcfcfa938569ae7fb86c0c309ee7d84558f1cc07eb2c1a30468c7%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E] on the mailing list. On a side note, we try to open also tickets for unrelated to our patch failures that no one has reported yet. 

Unfortunately, only committers and PMC members can submit Jenkins dev CI runs. But you might want to explore Circle CI. (Just please bear in mind that if you use LOWRES resources not all dtests will be able to run as they require more resources. Please contact me in Slack if you need more help with this or some info for the higher resources.)
 More information about our test environment can be found [here|https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/testing.html]

 

I also agree that the mentioned failures are not related to your patch.
 * [dtest-novnode.scrub_test.TestScrubIndexes.test_scrub_collections_table|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1141/testReport/junit/dtest-novnode.scrub_test/TestScrubIndexes/test_scrub_collections_table/] - CASSANDRA-16954
 * [org.apache.cassandra.net.ConnectionTest.testMessageDeliveryOnReconnect|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1141/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.net/ConnectionTest/testMessageDeliveryOnReconnect/] - CASSANDRA-16677

The rest of the failures seem like infrastructure known issues.

[~brandon.williams], if you don't have any other opinion, I can push also 4.0 CI and commit. I don't expect any difference to what we saw already for trunk but for completeness and to prevent any future unpleasant surprises.

bq. Brandon Williams, if you don't have any other opinion, I can push also 4.0 CI and commit. I don't expect any difference to what we saw already for trunk but for completeness and to prevent any future unpleasant surprises.

Totally agree with all of that, +1.

Cherry-picked to 4.0 [here|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commit/ed801da8a590178110f02952124b77f474399414] and submitted CI run to Jenkins [here|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1143/].

I believe no of the failures is related to this patch.
 * [dtest.repair_tests.incremental_repair_test.TestIncRepair.test_multiple_repair|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1143/testReport/junit/dtest.repair_tests.incremental_repair_test/TestIncRepair/test_multiple_repair/] - this test is known as being sometimes time sensitive so I will leave it for now
 * [ org.apache.cassandra.distributed.upgrade.MixedModeReadTest.mixedModeReadColumnSubsetDigestCheck|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1143/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.upgrade/MixedModeReadTest/mixedModeReadColumnSubsetDigestCheck/] - this seems something with the infra maybe?
 * [org.apache.cassandra.net.ProxyHandlerConnectionsTest.testExpireSome|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1143/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.net/ProxyHandlerConnectionsTest/testExpireSome/]. - I think we can open ticket for this one to revise it as it might have similar issues to those identified for testExpireSomeFromBatch in CASSANDRA-16538 (to be checked, I did a very, very quick skim here)

If there are no objections I can commit the patch to 4.0 and trunk later.

bq. this seems something with the infra maybe?

I think we need a ticket for that too, as it seems CASSANDRA-16803 didn't entirely solve this. I created CASSANDRA-17000.

bq. If there are no objections I can commit the patch to 4.0 and trunk later.

Looks good to me, +1.

Thank you [~Bowen Song]

Thank you [~brandon.williams] for opening a ticket, I also opened one for 

[dtest.repair_tests.incremental_repair_test.TestIncRepair.test_multiple_repair|https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1143/testReport/junit/dtest.repair_tests.incremental_repair_test/TestIncRepair/test_multiple_repair/]  - CASSANDRA-17005
