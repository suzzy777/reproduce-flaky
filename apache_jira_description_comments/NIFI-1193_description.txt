When the Kite processors were initially added in NIFI-238, we removed support for sending data directly to Hive tables because the dependencies were too large. Contacting the Hive MetaStore pulled in all of hive-exec and hive-metastore. I've created an alternative that increases the size by only 6.7MB (about 10% of what it was before).
