{{org.apache.ignite.internal.rebalance.ItRebalanceRecoveryTest}} is flaky on TC, see [TC history|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/test/5525445229026025351?currentProjectId=ApacheIgnite3xGradle_Test_IntegrationTests&expandTestHistoryChartSection=true&branch=%3Cdefault%3E].

After some invsetigation, I found out that the problem is the following:

# Imagine two threads: A and B.
# Thread A executes an update from the test. Primary replica generates a timestamp, creates a Raft command and tries to apply it, but the thread stalls for any reason.
# Thread B performs idle safe time sync. Primary replica generates a timestamp (larger than the timestamp from the previous step), creates a Raft command and successfully applies it.
# Thread A resumes its execution and applies its command. This means that the Raft command from thread B will be applied before the command from thread A, despite their timestamps being ordered differently.
# According to the test protocol, a node gets restarted and needs to apply the missing Raft log part, which means re-applying the two commands above. However, the second command (which inserts data) will be ignored, because there's code in {{PartitionListener}} that ignores storage updates if their timestamp is smaller than the current timestamp (which got updated by the first command).
 
Therefore, this bug is definitely caused by IGNITE-20116
