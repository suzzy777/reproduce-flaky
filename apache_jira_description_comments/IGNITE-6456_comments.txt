[~vozerov], [~isapego], [~ptupitsyn], please review. And if patch is ok, please add relevant changes to the other platforms.
[TC run|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1024378&] is almost OK, except {{ClientConnectorConfigurationParityTest.TestConnectorConfiguration}} in .NET suite  which was expected configuration  API changes, and some flaky tests in Queries2 suite.

I've added new config properties to .NET, tests should be green now.

May be we should include configuration property name in the exception text so that user knows where to look?
Like {{Thin client connection is disabled, see ClientConnectorConfiguration.thinClientEnabled.}}.

I've added more informative error messages as [~ptupitsyn] advised.

[~rkondakov], my comments:
1) There were no JavaDocs to new public methods. I added them.
2) Why do we return -1 as version? How is user supposed to understand it? Current version should be returned. 
3) [~ptupitsyn], as version in response may vary, please change the test so that it doesn't depend on returned server version.

[~ptupitsyn], [~vozerov], I fixed the returning version. Please review.

.NET test fixed. Waiting for TC run,

[~isapego], does it make sense to add C++ test as well?

[~ptupitsyn], sure. I'll add it.

[~rkondakov] I see some issues with {{onHandshake}} method:
* Duplicate response writing code.
* Incorrect {{clientType}} check. We should return an error immediately if {{clientType}} is not valid.
* Method is too big.

Let's refactor and fix these.

[~ptupitsyn], I refactored this method. Please review. Waiting for [TC run|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewQueued.html?itemId=1033689].

[~rkondakov]
* Can we avoid using exceptions for control flow? I mean, we throw exception and catch it right there.
* Unsupported version error looks dirty now: {{Client handshake failed: 'Unsupported version: ClientListenerProtocolVersion [major=-1, minor=-1, maintenance=-1]'. Client version: -1.-1.-1. Server version: 1.0.0}}, it was {{Client handshake failed: 'Unsupported version.'. Client version: -1.-1.-1. Server version: 1.0.0}}.

[~ptupitsyn],
* Exceptions look appropriate solution for this case due to multiple possible causes of failure - wrong client, disabled client or unsupported version. And exception here is a quite convenient way to stop execution and transfer an error message back to the client.
* I've fixed error message.

[~vozerov], [~ptupitsyn], please review. [TC run|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1034773&] is not OK, but failures are caused by problems in the master branch. JDBC tests are ok.

Looks good to me.
