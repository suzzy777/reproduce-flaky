> ParquetIOSuite fails consistently with master branch.

I'm a bit confused. Most PRs still have tests green.

Actually I think it's flaky.

Another failure: https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark/runs/7337786485

Maybe the test suite started flaky after SPARK-39195 was merged. I revert it and ran "SPARK-7837 Do not close output writer twice when commitTask() fails" dozens of times without failure. Still  investigate  the root cause.
