This RTE is not harmless. It will cause the internode connection to break which will cause all in flight requests between these nodes to die/timeout.

    - Due to changes in schema migration handling and the storage format after 3.0, you will
      see error messages such as:
         "java.lang.RuntimeException: Unknown column cdc during deserialization"
      in your system logs on a mixed-version cluster during upgrades. This error message
      is harmless and due to the 3.8 nodes having cdc added to their schema tables while
      the <3.8 nodes do not. This message should cease once all nodes are upgraded to 3.8.
      As always, refrain from schema changes during cluster upgrades.
