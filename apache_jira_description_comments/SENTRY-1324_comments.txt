Adding tests to make sure NotificationLog is capturing the information correctly for the commands which change <Obj,Location> mapping. This exercise is mainly to understand if NotificationLog works for us. I did hit some bugs, but seems like some of them are fixed in Hive 1.2.0. Will bump up Hive in jira SENTRY-1323 as I see there are more changes we need to make as part of hive dependency change.

Nice work!

{code}
public class TestNotificationLog extends AbstractMetastoreTestWithStaticConfiguration {
{code}
Hmm.  Would it make more sense to call this {{TestHmsNoticationLog}} to emphasize that it's testing the Hive notification log?  Or is that clear already

{{Assert.assertEquals}}: might make sense to static import this and other stuff in {{Assert}}, to shorten some long lines?

{{CurrentNotificationEventId NId}}: should we verify that this is monotonically increasing?

Thanks for the review [~cmccabe]! Made the following changes:
1. Added more tests and comments.
2. Disabled tests which need hive >= 1.2.0
3. Renamed the class to be more descriptive.
4. Added tests to make sure id is monotonically increasing.

We should be able to commit this without having to move hive dependency to >= 1.2.0. 

Also, as you can see in the tests, there is some information missing in the notification event log. Some of these can be obtained by doing another getTable()/getDatabase() call to HMS. But some of these are permanently lost if we do not capture them during the event. For example, for the command "Alter table location", we need the old location in Sentry to make sure we revoke the table related grants on this old location. We cannot jut delete all paths corresponding to this table in Sentry, as there might be some partitions which point to this table and hence <Obj,Path> is a many-many in Sentry. Also, capturing the location would allow to see have the entire context in notification log entry without having to do another HMS RPC to get missing information. Hence, I propose adding additional info in the notification log entry. Thoughts?

I think adding additional info to the notification log makes a lot of sense.

Is the {{TestDbPrivilegeCleanupOnDrop}} failure related?

Yes, the failure is related. It is because we are not using the Sentry, post event listener which communicates with Sentry service when a table is dropped. Need to make changes, so that only this test uses the DbNotificationListener. Will update the patch.

Addressed review comments and attaching a new patch and RB link.

Test failure does not look related. Filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SENTRY-1385 for fixing the flaky test.

+1, thanks Sravya.
