It is needed to fix flaky tests:

SystemViewSelfTest.testContinuousQuery test  – [TC history|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&testNameId=2075278944640125900&tab=testDetails&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F7696%2Fhead]

SqlViewExporterSpiTest#testContinuousQuery – [TC history|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&buildTypeId=&tab=testDetails&testNameId=-5486808152570919536&order=START_DATE_DESC&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F7622%2Fhead&itemsCount=50]

JmxExporterSpiTest#testContinuousQuery – no failures so far but the same test scenario is used as above.

It seems that QueryCursor#close method 
 gives no guarantees that CQ routine will be cleared from all nodes before its returning. This behavior is due to StopRoutineDiscoveryMessage is immutable and so StopRoutineAckDiscoveryMessage can be received (QueryCoursor#close method returns) before GridContinuousProcessor#processStopRequest completion on all nodes.
