4.0 comes without thrift (after [CASSANDRA-11115]) and COMPACT STORAGE (after [CASSANDRA-10857]), and since Compact Storage flags are now disabled, all of the related functionality is useless.

There are still some things to consider:
1. One of the system tables (built indexes) was compact. For now, we just added {{value}} column to it to make sure it's backwards-compatible, but we might want to make sure it's just a "normal" table and doesn't have redundant columns.
2. Compact Tables were building indexes in {{KEYS}} mode. Removing it is trivial, but this would mean that all built indexes will be defunct. We could log a warning for now and ask users to migrate off those for now and completely remove it from future releases. It's just a couple of classes though.
