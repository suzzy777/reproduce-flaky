TL;DR: the CM RestartRS action timeout is only 60 seconds. Considering the RS must connect to the Master before it can be online, this is not long enough time in an environment where the Master can also be killed.

Failure from the console says the test failed because a RestartRsHoldingMetaAction timed out.

This is only reported at the end of the test run. There's no indication as to when during the test run this failure happened. The timeout on the start RS operation is 60 seconds.

Hacking out the start/stop messages from the logs during the time window when this test ran, it appears that at one point the RS took 2min 12s between when it was launched and when it reported for duty

The RS came up without incident. It spent 1min 4s of that time waiting on the master to start, attempted to report for duty from 14:54:28 to 14:55:24.
