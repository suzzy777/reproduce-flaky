This follows up on ARTEMIS-2990 to address the underlying data structure for the wildcard address map. In place of a map of addresses with lists of cross references (which grow linearly), a tree map reflecting the hierarchy of addresses and wildcards is used. This partitions the search space in a natural way with the address hierarchy.

in place of collections, a visitor allows access to contained bindings for processing allowing parallel work.

the read and update paths to access bindings are also separated out to allow the read to do minimum work.
