Since https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-21433, there are four s390x Jenkins build nodes available. Could the HBase CI be extended to build on s390x as well?

There is an old issue open about adding s390x support to the HBase CI but it has not received any update in quite some time. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-25192. There was some interest in starting by adding s390x to the nightly builds. Would that still be the best way to start?

Let me know if there are any questions. I'm happy to help in any way I can.
