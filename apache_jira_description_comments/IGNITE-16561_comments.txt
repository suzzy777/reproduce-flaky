Not a blocker, because current tx protocol in Ignite3 will be reworked, there’s no much sense in fixing all it’s issues.

I’ve run test on TC more than 100 times (test is quite long, app. 2 minutes on TC, 300 minutes in total), issue has not been reproduced, so I would close the issue. [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/buildConfiguration/ignite3_Test_IntegrationTests_ModuleRunner/6621656?]

Resolved as "cannot reproduce"
