A flaky test has been discovered with recent modernizations of the sandbox components. It lives in 'nlp-utils' and the problem signals a fragile test setup or potentially numerical instabilities:
{quote}Error: org.apache.opennlp.utils.regression.GradientDescentUtilsTest.testConvergence Time elapsed: 1.156 s <<< ERROR!

The problem (sometimes) occurs on different platforms / environments (Win, Lin, Mac).

Aims:
 * Investigate the cause of the flakyness
 * Fix the test (environment / setup) so it runs reliably.
