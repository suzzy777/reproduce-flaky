The test for the commit log segment size when the specified size is 32MB. It fails for me locally and on on cassci. ([cassci link|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/trunk/job/trunk_dtest/305/testReport/commitlog_test/TestCommitLog/default_segment_size_test/])

The command to run the test by itself is {{CASSANDRA_VERSION=git:trunk nosetests commitlog_test.py:TestCommitLog.default_segment_size_test}}.

EDIT: a similar test, {{commitlog_test.py:TestCommitLog.small_segment_size_test}}, also fails with a similar error.

The solution here may just be to change the expected size or the acceptable error -- the result isn't far off. I'm happy to make the dtest change if that's the solution.
