We start webservice in a goroutine [https://github.com/apache/yunikorn-core/blob/db70ca6e0ed46eb93362fc1bf48545781146f534/pkg/webservice/webservice.go#L71-L77].

Sometime, client sends request before webservice is running (client.GetEvents faster than webservice in ms.Init) [https://github.com/apache/yunikorn-core/blob/db70ca6e0ed46eb93362fc1bf48545781146f534/pkg/scheduler/tests/application_tracking_test.go#L45-L50].

In this case, we will get `application_tracking_test.go:51: assertion failed: error is not nil: Get "http://localhost:9080/ws/v1/events/batch": dial tcp [::1]:9080: connect: connection refused`.
