Since this is not a blocker issue, as part of the 2.6.0 release process I'm changing the fix version to `2.6.1` and `2.7.0`. If this is incorrect, please respond and discuss on the "[DISCUSS] Apache Kafka 2.6.0 release" discussion mailing list thread.

Since this isn't a blocker and there isn't another reported failure and no PR submitted,  as part of the 2.7.0 release process I'm clearing the "fix version" field.  When there is a PR for this issue, we can set the "fix version" at that time.
