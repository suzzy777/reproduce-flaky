comments.q is a known flaky test which is being fixed in HIVE-16256. [~aihuaxu] Can you please review the patch?

Looks good to me. +1

[~vihangk1]: Sorry to not chime in before, but I have used this function previously to hide configuration entities: {{HiveConfUtil.dumpConfig}}. Should not we use dumpConfig instead, or extend it if needed?

Thanks,
Peter

Thanks [~pvary]. Seems it's a good idea to use HiveConfUtil.dumpConfig() which will hide hiddenSet. [~vihangk1] how do you think?

{{HiveConfUtil.dumpConfig}} uses a StringBuilder to dump the config values while {{Configuration.dumpConfiguration}} dumps the configs in a JSON format. Also it adds some msgs like {{"sb.append("Values omitted for security reason if present: ").append(hiddenSet).append("\n");
"}} I didn't feel it would be a good idea to like duplicate the JSON conversion logic in Hive when Hadoop Configuration object already provides utility method for that. There is a another method called {{HiveConfUtil.stripConfigurations}} which replaces the hidden configs values with empty Strings. This I thought is little confusing because the user doesn't know if the config value is really an empty string or it was stripped for security reasons. So thought of adding a new util method which uses {{***REDACTED***}} string so that it is clear that it was indeed redacted for security reasons. Let me know if I should remove  {{HiveConfUtil.redactConfigurations}} and use {{HiveConfUtil.stripConfigurations}} instead.

Hi [~vihangk1],

One solution could be:
- Add a new parameter to stripConfigurations - replaceString: the string which should used instead of the hidden ones. Maybe we should rename the method too, to match the new function
- Use the dumpConfiguration in {{FileSinkOperator}}, {{RemoteHiveSparkClient}}, since the functionality seems the same to me.
- Use this stripConfigurations method with "***REDACTED***" in case of the {{ConfServlet}}

Another thing that occurred to me after taking a second look on the patch:
- Is it planned, that we hide the configuration values in the {{ConfServlet}} only in json format, and not in xml format?

Anyway, thanks for catching this issue, I thought I already removed all of the unstripped configuration dumps!

Thanks,
Peter

All good suggestions [~pvary]. Incorporated most of those, except that we cannot re-use HiveConfUtil.dumpConfiguration() in RemoteHiveSparkClient and FileSinkOperator because they are dumping JobConf object not HiveConf object.

Had a discussion with [~aihuaxu] and he thinks it will be better if we stick to one approach which we have already in the source code to redact sensitive information from the configs. The current approach is replace the sensitive keys with EMPTY strings. Re-using existing methods instead. [~aihuaxu] can you please review the latest patch?

+1 on patch-3. Pending test.

Pushed to master. Thanks Vihang.

Thanks for the review [~aihuaxu] and [~pvary]
