Hi [~rohini], can you make me a contributor for Oozie. Would like to provide a patch for this issue.

[~prabhujoseph] I could help you uploading patch file. Please let me know if I can help you.

Hi [~dionusos], can you assign this to me. If not, please feel free to assign to yourself.

[~prabhujoseph]   I cannot find you in the list.
 [~andras.piros] Can you please help us? Thanks.

[~rkanter] can you please make [~prabhujoseph] an Oozie contributor within JIRA? Thanks!

Done.

Thanks [~rkanter]. Have included both avro and avro-mapred jars into Sqoop Sharelib so that Sqoop Avro import works fine. Need your help in reviewing the patch.

[~prabhujoseph] the test is flaky, most likely can be ignored. Can you provide the workflow and sqoop query, I may be able to test this patch. Also, why not use Avro 1.8.1 instead?

[~dbist13] Yes, changed the Avro version to 1.8.1. Have attached Workflow and the Sqoop command to import from Mysql VERSION table to an Avro file.

Hi [~dbist13], have you had a chance to look into this.

[~prabhujoseph] not yet, have to stand up an environment to test this.

[~andras.piros] Can you review this when you get some time. Thanks.

[~prabhujoseph] thanks for the contribution! Can you think of an automated test case?

[~andras.piros] Have tried a simple test case by just adding the " --as-avrodatafile" into the SQOOP_COMMAND part of TestSqoopActionExecutor.java but it succeeds. Looks the avro import runs fine on local mode but not on actual distributed mode.

SQOOP_COMMAND = "import --connect \{0} --table TT --as-avrodatafile --target-dir \{1} -m 1";

[~prabhujoseph] is it still an issue in Oozie 5.2 as well?

[~prabhujoseph] OOZIE-3553 fixed a very similar bug.

[~kmarton] [~asalamon74] Looks OOZIE-3553 will fix this issue. Will close this as duplicate. Thanks.
