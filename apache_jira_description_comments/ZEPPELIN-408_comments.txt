    ZEPPELIN-408 Fix configuration bug of notebook and interpreter directory

    Detail description of this issue is in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-408). This PR removes some lines of code to set directory configuration in `common.sh`. Although we remove the codes, configuration will be okay because `ZeppelinConfiguration` object has default values.

    Could you guide me to merge this pull request? I couldn't find why CI fails.

    @chiwanpark It seems like that Spark cluster doesn't run successfully, but I don't know the correct reason because of none of spark's log. Could you please trigger CI again?

    @jongyoul I triggered Travis again and got an error in `ZeppelinIT.testAngularDisplay:183`. Is this error relative to this changes?

    @chiwanpark Sorry for late reply. I think it would be a kind of flaky test. I'll test this in my local machine.

    That failure looks related other tests that set some properties like `System.setProperty(ConfVars.ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_DIR.getVarName(), mainNotebookDir.getAbsolutePath());`
    I think it could be resolved simply by using `System.clearProperty(ConfVars.ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_DIR.getVarName())` before creating ZeppelinConfiguration.
