would it be possible to test against Apache 11.3 ?

I have the same issue. I have done the exact same steps as OP.

Using:
 * Apache Netbeans 11.3
 * Java 11
 * Maven 3.6.1

 

Here's Netbeans about info:
{noformat}
Product Version: Apache NetBeans IDE 11.3
Java: 11.0.6; Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.6+8-LTS
Runtime: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 11.0.6+8-LTS
System: Windows 10 version 10.0 running on amd64; Cp1252; en_US (nb)
User directory: C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\NetBeans\11.3
Cache directory: C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\NetBeans\Cache\11.3
{noformat}
 

Here's my Java version output: 
{noformat}
java version "11.0.6" 2020-01-14 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.6+8-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.6+8-LTS, mixed mode)
{noformat}
 

Here's the popup it shows:

Here's the output Netbeans is giving me:
{noformat}
cd C:\Users\User\Documents\NetBeansProjects\albatross-auctioneer; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.6" "M2_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Maven 3.6.1" cmd /c "\"C:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Maven 3.6.1\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -Dexec.args=\"-agentpath:\\\"C:/Program Files/Netbeans 11.3/netbeans/profiler/lib/deployed/jdk16/windows-amd64/profilerinterface.dll\\\"=\\\"C:\\Program Files\\Netbeans 11.3\\netbeans\\profiler\\lib\\\",5140,10 -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\NetBeans\\Cache\\11.3\\mavencachedirs\\811406648\\org-netbeans-modules-profiler -classpath %classpath com.chronolab.albatross.auctioneer.Main\" -Dexec.executable=\"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.6\\bin\\java.exe\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"C:\\Program Files\\Netbeans 11.3\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 process-classes org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.5.0:exec"
The syntax of the command is incorrect. {noformat}

Profiling appears broken in NB12.0 but works fine in NB11.3.

The bundled Maven went from 3.3.9 to 3.6.3

I get the same problem with Windows 7, NetBeans IDE 12.3, bundled maven version is 3.6.3, JDK is 14.
So no profiler in NetBeans. Maven is preferred project type. What to do?

Same issue 
 * *Product Version:* Apache NetBeans IDE 12.4
 * *Java:* 11.0.11; OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.11+9
 * *Runtime:* OpenJDK Runtime Environment 11.0.11+9
 * *System:* Windows 10 version 10.0 running on amd64; Cp1252;
 * *Maven:* 3.6.3+

Same problem windows 10
 The only way that i found to run profiler is manually attach the project, in my example *profileTest* is the name of my project.

3- Copy de arguments

4- Click on properties of the project, paste the arguments
 !image-2021-07-21-03-01-40-283.png|width=746,height=309!

 

5- Now execute the project

!image-2021-07-21-03-03-15-783.png|width=361,height=131!

You will see a message like that:

6- Now click on Attach,and the application will start.

I'm investigating the source code, till now no success, below the modules that i believe that are related with the bug:

*Module*: Maven Projects
 *Path:* netbeans\java\maven
 *Class*: MavenCommandLineExecutor

 And

*Module*: Java Profiler (Common)
 *Path:* netbeans\profiler\lib.profiler.common
 *Classes*: IntegrationUtils, SessionSettings

On Linux, everything works fine.

Tried again with NetBeans 12.4 and bundled Maven. Breaks. I get output:
Files\NetBeans-12.4\netbeans\profiler\lib\\"" was unexpected at this time.

The beginning of the line is the truncated "C:\Program Files\NetBeans-12.4 ..."

I would not know whether this is actually a NetBeans problem or a Maven problem because the error output is different depending on which Maven version is used.

This is sad because NetBeans has switched to Maven as its main / preferred build system.

So clearly we cannot deal with spaces in paths. We Java people are stupid. We cannot even get out of bed. Let alone deal with complex programs. Back to sleep. Good night... ZZZZZZ

With IDE 12.4 on Windows, if I extract and run it in a directory without spaces, then with bundled Maven I get a different error "The syntax of the command is incorrect.".

But then at least I can get around this error by using the older Maven version 3.3.9.

So we have TWO issues. At least one is a Maven issue. I also remember this vaguely from about a year ago because I used this workaround then with IDE 12.3 I think. From my notes then (sorry I am getting tired, have to go back to sleep):

https://issues.maven.apache.narkive.com/u1YebYNI/jira-created-mng-6385-windows-mvn-cmd-fail-with-incorrect-command-syntax
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13756224/splitting-the-parameter-in-a-batch-file-multiple-times/13779820#13779820]

This is the sort of thing that happens if one lets things slip for too long. Total meltdown. I would suggest to create a blocking dependency such as NOT to ship a Windows installer until it is verified that the profiler works WITH THE BUNDLED MAVEN VERSION.

In other words this has to be escalated and cannot be dealt with purely by looking at the profiler alone.

[~sdedic] can you confirm what the state of play is with this since changes in 12.5? And close if fixed. Thanks.
