We could check in minidumps, because they should contain the ThreadDebugInfo objects.

I think it should be easy to crash an impalad from a test (or just make it to write a minidump), but a lot depends on the timing.

Maybe we could poll on some metrics, then send USR1 signal to the impalad to write a minidump. But I'm afraid that this still depends too much on timing, so the test will be flaky.

Using SIGUSR1 to write a minidump should work. We can run a query with a long enough sleep in it, then write a minidump, wait for it to be finished. The utility code in the minidump tests should already allow us to do that.
