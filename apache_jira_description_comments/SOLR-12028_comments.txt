Do we really need to close the individual test issues as well? That lets us link to the individual issue for a test in the annotation and keep discussion and history related to each test separate as necessary. We can still have an overall tracking issue like this, but it doesnt seem like a great substitute for having issues individually for bad tests.Â 

[~markrmiller@gmail.com] Yeah, as I was going through the linked issues I realized that ones with discussion were valuable. So I left the ones that had any discussion or investigation info open and didn't change the annotation (except perhaps to change from AwaitsFix to BadApple). The ones I closed had no information/investigation info, they were just "BadAppling because it fails too often"...

The attached patch is what it's looking like so far. Below is a list of all the BadApple and AwaitsFix annotations in the code base currently. I have to go over this again and run the test suite, but wanted to post them in case people want to keep some running because they're actively getting attention. Some of the failing tests are in areas getting a lot of active work so may be good candidates for leaving in, just let me know.

Assuming that tests pass, I'm probably going to check these in Monday sometime after making another pass to see whether I put them in the right category.

I intend to post the below info to the dev list each Sunday (or so) so these tests don't get lost forever.

[~steve_rowe] Right, but this is expected since tests.badapples=true is the default. I'm setting up a mail filter to funnel any report that does _not_ have tests.badapples=false to a special folder.

[~thetaphi] Are we going to set up some number of runs with badapples=false? Any of _those_ that fail need immediate attention.......

bq. Steve Rowe Right, but this is expected since tests.badapples=true is the default. 

Um, clearly I haven't been following closely enough, but: a regime that guarantees failed Jenkins runs 100% of the time is the opposite of useful.

bq. Uwe Schindler Are we going to set up some number of runs with badapples=false? Any of those that fail need immediate attention.......

IMHO, the vast majority of Jenkins runs should be configured with badapples=false.  I'll go change every one of the existing jobs right now.

[~erickerickson], I think your question should be rephrased: "Once all Jenkins runs are configured badapples=false, are we going to set up some number of runs with badapples=true?"

[~steve_rowe] Fair enough. I expect it to take a bit to make this smooth. Here's the goal as I see it, subject to negotiation. How we work it out is TBD:

Tests that are always broken are AwaitsFix. These won't be run regularly. I'm going to provide a report each week (just an e-mail to the dev list) with the current tests with either AwaitsFix or BadApple annotations.

BadApple tests should be run often enough to give various summaries something to report on (e.g. Hoss' report, your work). Personally I'm going to filter them to a special folder that I can examine at leisure.

Anything run with tests.badapples=false that fails requires immediate attention. For a short while that may just be adding BadApple annotations. When things settle down, adding more BadApple annotations should only rarely be done.




bq. BadApple tests should be run often enough to give various summaries something to report on

I think I saw weekly frequency suggested elsewhere for badapple tests, but then Hoss's 7-day summary won't have much to work with.  I think daily is a better frequency.

I'll set up daily job with badapple=true for master and branch_7x, and another set of weekly jobs with nightly=true & badapples=true (there are a few tests with this annotation combination), on both Apache and my Jenkins.

[~thetaphi], do you want to host badapple tests on Policeman Jenkins?


bq. Uwe Schindler, do you want to host badapple tests on Policeman Jenkins?

Yes, sure. I'd prefer {{@daily/2}}. When this is commit I will duplicate Master and 7.x Jobs. For release branches it makes no sense to run BadApple tests. But that's my opinion.

[~steve_rowe], with this patch you don't need to change the existing jobs. If you run "ant jenkins-hourly" ant task it will not run bad apples. If you run "jenkins-badapples" it's the new variant. It's all in build file!

[~thetaphi] This is committed, I'm keeping it open for a bit while we adjust.

SOLR-12028: Fix typo in property name


Hi [~steve_rowe]: There was a typo in property name, the ANT tasks are setup correctly. I removed the useless property from jenkins, it should just run "ant jenkins-hourly" or "ant jenkins-badapples", nothing more.

I did not touch ASF Jenkins. I will setup daily jobs calling "ant jenkins-badapples" on policeman later!

Thanks [~thetaphi], I'll remove the useless property from ASF Jenkins jobs.

SOLR-12028: add jenkins-nightly-badapples target


Good idea with the extra target.

Hi, I just noticed that the reproduce line was not consistent with all test groups. Also the sysprop defaults were initialized differently to the undelying annotations. This patch fixes this and makes the defaults "dynamic" (from annotation): [^SOLR-12028-sysprops-reproduce.patch]

Will commit in a moment.

SOLR-12028: BadApple and AwaitsFix annotations usage

(cherry picked from commit b732f06)


I've very confused by some of the changes made under the banner of this issue, and since SOLR-12016 was evidently deleted, it's hard to find the "long discussion of this topic" to see if it's explained there (i could have tried to piece it together from mail archives, but instead i'm just going to take the summary in *this* jira at face value) ...

I draw attention to this comment...
{quote}This JIRA is a placeholder for BadApple tests to point to between the times they're identified as BadApple and they're either fixed or changed to AwaitsFix or assigned their own JIRA.
{quote}
...and yet, when i look at {{ZkControllerTest.testPublishAndWaitForDownStates}} I can not wrap my head around the changes made to that test as part of this issue.

Prior to the creation of SOLR-12028...
 * {{ZkControllerTest.testPublishAndWaitForDownStates}} was disabled using {{AwaitsFix}}
 * The {{AwaitsFix}} anotation pointed to SOLR-7736 which was an OPEN issue because the test was known to be broken
 ** admittedly, the issue didn't have much in the description, but it was explicitly open knowing that this test was currently broken
 * As a result, this completely broken test was never being run and never failing.

As a result of SOLR-12028...
 * SOLR-7736 is now marked "Resolved:Duplicate"
 ** even though there is no "Duplicates" link to any other jira ??????
 * The {{AwaitsFix}} annotation was replaced by a {{BadApple}} annotation which links here to SOLR-12028 *and* to SOLR-7736...
 ** even though the guidelines of both annotations (as i've always understood them) are that they aren't suppose to link to closed issues???
 * so now this test is running for all developers, even though it was known in advance to be broken and "awaiting fix"

In short: this test already met the "end goal" of "either fixed or changed to AwaitsFix or assigned their own JIRA." and yet now it's in a worse state then when we started...

*WAT?*

What am i not understanding about this process?  what is the point of mucking with tests like these that were already {{AwaitsFix}} pointing to *OPEN* issues???

Well, the process is evolving. I saw no use in keeping a separate open JIRA that simply said "this test doesn't succeed very often". I thought that pointing people at the uber-JIRA would provide more context. Whether that's the right call or not is an open question.

SOLR-7736: Right, I linked it under "related to" rather than "duplicates", we can add a duplicates link in if you'd like. I put in both JIRAs to allow a complete record, if it's too confusing we can remove, say, the 7736 reference.

As for AwaitsFix, the theory (which I may not have adhered to completely, feel free to correct) is that when something is actually known to be broken, i.e. code we can point to and say "this code is broken" doesn't need to be run until, well, the code is fixed. This would include dependent libs, code where the root cause is known but not fixed and the like. AwaitsFix aren't run periodically so disappear from sight.

BadApple, OTOH, is "this test doesn't run reliably, we have no clue why". These are also run periodically for the various reports to be able to see. That way they don't get lost.

It looked to me like AwaitsFix and BadApple were applied somewhat interchangeably so this is an attempt to bring regularity to the annotations.

I reconstructed SOLR-12016 under SOLR-12037 BTW.

bq: so now this test is running for all developers

As it should IMO unless and until we do one of the following
1> decide it's just a crappy test and remove it
2> identify the root problem is and move it to AwaitsFix and link it to a JIRA with the RCA.
3> fix it and remove the annotation altogether.

Note that for <3>, I'm starting by commenting out the annotation and providing the date it was commented out on the theory that if the test starts failing again it would be good information to have. OTOH if we look at this in 6 months and it hasn't failed in that time, the commented-out annotation can be removed.

My two main goals are:
1> surface any tests that fail regularly with no RCA for reports etc.
2> get clean runs with BadApple=false to catch regressions

I don't particularly care what the mechanics are. You'll see, every Sunday, a report to the dev list for the current BadApple and AwaitsFix annotations, file and method. This should complement your reports (which are way cool BTW).

So that's all the theory, I expect a few things to shift around before it all settles out...

bq. As for AwaitsFix, the theory (which I may not have adhered to completely, feel free to correct) is that when something is actually known to be broken, i.e. code we can point to and say "this code is broken" doesn't need to be run until, well, the code is fixed.  ...

isn't that exactly the situation SOLR-7736 was in before you started this?  the test was known to be broken and reliably fails 100% of the time, and had an open isssue to track fixing it in the future?

As i said: SOLR-7736 already had a jira -- the description was sparse, but FWIW: it did link back to another jira that explained the problem with the test ... AFAICT it already met the "end goal" you were aiming for.

----

Bottom line...

* I understood the initial motivation to: identify flaky tests; mark them as BAdApple to get them off the regular jenkins builds; maybe mark them as AwaitsFix.
* I also understand the value in saying "AwaitsFix pointed at a closed issue is useless" -- let's assess those, maybe try them as BadApple, open new issues / re-AwaitsFix if needed
* I do not understand what happened with this test...
** why should *ANY* test that was _already_ marked AwaitsFix, pointing to an *open* jira have been changed to BadApple?
** why should any _open_ jira saying "this test is broken" have been resolved just to redirect here / open a new issue later?

if the concern was that some issues didn't do a "good enough" job of explaining why the test was broken, then that should have been raised in those jiras.  it just doesn't make much sense to me at all to resolve them (to just open new ones later).  Like wise it seems completely bizare to me to take a test that's already marked AwaitsFix, which can easily be demonstrated to fail 100% of the time and change it to "BadApple" so that it starts getting in the way and failing for all devs.

Then change it to point back to 7736, I really don't care. My initial changes were essentially straw-man. I'm perfectly happy to have that late-night judgement call reversed if you feel strongly about it.

Here's the tests that have failed since 12028 (not even including the Lucene "can't delete file" list), we have far more productive things to do than argue over that one.

bq. why should any open jira saying "this test is broken" have been resolved just to redirect here / open a new issue later?

As I mentioned above, I also don't think this is the way to go. It's fine to open an issue to track all this work, but makes no sense to close the issues per problem test.

bq. why should ANY test that was already marked AwaitsFix, pointing to an open jira have been changed to BadApple?

The only reason I believe that should happen is because the test does not fail very often vs failing a lot.

bq.  we have far more productive things to do than argue over that one.

I don't think any of us are interested in arguing, just taking the best approach. Our annotations are made to point at a single issue where we can discuss what is wrong with a test and attach patches, etc. When it's closed we can remove the annotation. Closing those kinds of issues for this bulk issue is not something I want to argue about - it's something that seems ... wrong.

This issue should be about annotations. Let the other issues live and be about fixing the individual tests. They close when the annotations go away.

[~erickerickson], I'd like to consider removing BadApple forÂ BasicAuthIntegrationTest, it's been tagged for a month. How can I check whether it still fails and for what reason?

(cherry picked from commit e04a28e1400514e104a867f5d6c76f8761ff348a)


FWIW: It's my intention to review all of the issues still annotated with {{@BadApple(SOLR\-12028)}} to see how many of them are problematic, and if so why.Â  
For tracking purposes, I'll make sure to include mention of this Jira in any commits to either remove or change the annotion (ie: if i identify an underlying bug and promote to {{@AwaitsFix}}

TestDistributedStatsComponentCardinality: Remove @BadApple anotation

This test was originally anotated @BadApple ~2018-10-14 as pat of SOLR-12028.

So far in 2019, it has failed in 62 jenkins-BadApple builds, but all prior to 2019-06-14.

Since we no longer have logs from those older jenkins builds, it's hard to be certain how/why
this test was failing, or why exactly it *stopped* failing -- but a likely suspect is that
the root cause of the problem may have been fixed as part of the Jetty upgrade in SOLR-13541.

HdfsRecoveryZkTest & HdfsNNFailoverTest: Remove @BadApple anotation

These tests were originally anotated @BadApple in early 2018 as pat of SOLR-12028.

Neither test has failed since 2018-12-28.

Since we no longer have logs from those older jenkins builds, it's hard to be certain how/why this
test was failing, or why exactly it stopped failing â but it's possible the underlying issues were
addressed by general hardening of SolrCloud and the associated base test classes around the same time.

(cherry picked from commit 1ca7067a810578d4e246b5434b9cdcec7145d230)


I'm not changing annotations nearly as often as previously. Between that and SOLR-14636, this Jira has outlived it's usefulness.

Going forward, we can open up a new one if necessary.
