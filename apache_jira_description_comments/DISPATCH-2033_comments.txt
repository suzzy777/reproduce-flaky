Review comment:
       That's a surprising fix. If 1 is connected to 2 then how can 2 not be connected to 1?
   Not to say that this is not a fix but maybe it's just the time spent executing the wait allows for some other thing to stabilize and not that 2 was not connected to 1.

Review comment:
       If you look here - https://github.com/apache/qpid-dispatch/blob/main/tools/qdstat.in#L1052
   The has_nodes() function returns False if the number of nodes is less than 2. And the string "UTC" is being displayed if has_nodes() is True, hence this PR. Also take a look at this output when we print the output of qdstat, one of the routers is missing. That being said, I have been unable to reproduce this problem locally and based on the evidence, I am hoping that this PR would fix the problem.
