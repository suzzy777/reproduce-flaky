[~mpercy] any thoughts on this, as master of all things RemoteBootstrap?

Sounds like we are missing a check in the followers if they have been deleted with TABLET_DATA_DELETED ... we should probably reject requests to bootstrap in that case, since it's only supposed to be used for permanent deletions.

I don't think this will work; isn't a tablet deleted with TABLET_DATA_DELETED gone from the tablet map? Seems like TSTabletManager::StartRemoteBootstrap won't find the existing tablet, at which point it can't tell this case apart from remote bootstrapping a brand new tablet.

Todd's suggestion was to add a cache of some kind that holds the most recently deleted tablets. The followers would use this cache to decide whether to accept or deny an RB request that just came in. It'd be important to get the TTL of cache right, otherwise we'd prevent RB of a tablet that was explicitly deleted with the goal of using RB to fetch it anew.

What do you think?

I was thinking the cache could be used only for the case of TABLET_DATA_DELETED. That kind of deletion indicates that the table or tablet is gone and never coming back, so there's no reason for us to "fetch it anew".

Mike posted a patch for this, so assigning it to him :)
