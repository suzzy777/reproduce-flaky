[~gilbert] please make sure this ticket has a shepherd.

Leave a note here, this flaky test cannot be reproduced in 7300+ iterations on my Ubuntu 14.04 VM. 

I am not sure whether this is because we use {{tar -czf}} to create tar and use {{tar -xf}} to extract tar or not. We create a gzip compressed tar and extract it in normal way. tar could use gzip to decompress automatically. But I not sure whether it doesn't work in some case.

I think need replace 
{code}
    ASSERT_SOME(os::tar(".", "../layer.tar"));
{code}
to {{command::tar}} to keep consistent.


Yes, I am also thinking either use `command::tar` or deprecate this test case.

It occur again:

My feeling is that this one and MESOS-3578 look as if they were the same issue, should we mark a duplicate?

The problem persists it seems; observed it on Ubuntu 16.04Â (internal CI):
