The way some structs like CreationMetadata, CompactionInfo, ColumnStatistics are defined in hive_metastore.thrift is that these structs are used before they are defined. While this works for the java code which is generated, it does not work for the generated cpp code since Thrift does not use pointer/references to the forward declared classes.

The easy fix for this would be to reorder the struct definitions in the hive_metastore.thrift so that they are always defined before they are used.
