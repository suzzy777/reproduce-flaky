I'm seeing this quite frequently in ASF CI. Looks like this test was written as part of reservation refinement. [~bmahler] can you get this into resource mgmt backlog?

    Fixed a flaky master volume authorization failure test.

    The authorized function matcher would sometimes match a retry of
    the agent registration authorization. To ensure the matcher only
    matches the appropriate CREATE_VOLUME operation, we now specify
    that the argument should have the CREATE_VOLUME action.
