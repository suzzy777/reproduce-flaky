Yesterday the Maven PreCommit job failed for me for two unrelated PRs. Both cases the failing test case was {{org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerMainTest.testFailedTxnAsPartOfQuorumLoss}}

Re-running the precommit job helped, so I think the test is flaky.

 
{code:java}
java.lang.AssertionError: create /zk2 should have failed
 at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerMainTest.testFailedTxnAsPartOfQuorumLoss(QuorumPeerMainTest.java:822){code}
