This is an assertion failure so it could be a cassandra problem or just a test code issue.

Local testing seems to confirm it's a timing problem with the test flapping when things are a bit slower. A wait time increase on the test appears likely to fix, will investigate a bit more.

fix at https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/834

looks like initial fix wasn't quite right. looks like possibly a small race condition in the test code, vetting a fix now.

better fix here: https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/836

fixed on dtest pr above.
