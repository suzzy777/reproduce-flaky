[~shellberg] don't set Fix Version (it's not fixed); Target version is for committers as well.

Sean : apologies, re: Fix Version and Target Version.  I was led astray in interpreting their purpose given they were present on the Create issue template.
Fix Version makes complete sense: until the fix is integrated its not fixed; Target version... I'd interpreted that as where I'd hope to see the fix released/is suitable for being applied.  I know this issue arises in the 1.4.x release (and probably before) but I'm mostly interested in seeing this addressed in current/future releases; my fix is likely sufficient in prior releases equally, so what criteria is used to suggest how far back a committer would backport into prior releases (given only Affects Versions)?

Yes, the problem is anyone who submits a JIRA presumably wants to see it addressed and soon. Few are actually actionable, valid, and something that the submitter follows through on. Hence Target Version ought to be set only by someone who is willing and able to drive to a resolution. Then the view of JIRAs targeted at a release is a somewhat reliable picture of what could happen in that release. It's still used unevenly but that's the reason.

If it's likely to be resolved rapidly like this one I usually don't even bother, but, it'd be valid to target at 1.6 / 1.5.2 after seeing it's probably a fine change that passes tests, etc (still some style failures)

Thanks for the clarification Sean.  And, I've given my patches' comments a bit of a haircut... Sorry, I probably err on verbosity.
(Ahem, some would likely consider that a stylistic failure ;-) ).

I've also had a go at getting to grips with  the dev/lint-scala tool applied to the codebase with my proposed (revised) patch, which passes now.

Added some indentation to those comments for alignment... hopefully in-line with SPARK practice!
