We want to enable Ratis to run on high-performance RDMA networks. There has already been quite a bit of activity in leveraging RDMA networks in modern data processing stacks. Distributed consensus is one of the problems that can be accelerated using high-performance/RDMA messaging. 

We start by implementing a Ratis RPC implementation using DiSNI and DaPRC modules (https://github.com/zrlio/) for RDMA networks.
