The memory manager tests are flaky, depending on the heap allocation for the JVM they run in. This is caused by over-specific tests that assert the memory allocation down to the byte and the fact that some assertions implicitly cast long values to doubles to use the "within" form of assertEquals.

The tests should not validate a specific allocation strategy, but should instead assert that:
1. The allocation for a file is the row group size until room runs out
2. When scaling row groups, the total allocation does not exceed the pool size
