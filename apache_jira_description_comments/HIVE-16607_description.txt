Creating a new {{QueryState}} object regenerates the HIVEQUERYID stored in the {{HiveConf}}.

In HiveServer logs it makes hard to follow the life of the query since a new queryid is assigned to the query during the execution.

Since BeeLine is showing the operation logs based on the queryid, only the first several line of the logs is showed in BeeLine.
