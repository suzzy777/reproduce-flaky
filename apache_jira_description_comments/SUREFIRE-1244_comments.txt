Pls check it out with the latest version 2.19.1.

I am not 100% sure if I've seen it with 2.19.1 - we switched to 2.19.1 a week or so before I filed this bug report, and I didn't notice any failures with this cause after the 2.19.1 switch.  But I don't look at every failure in the build system, so I can't guarantee it didn't occur with 2.19.1.  (And it's also something that only occurs once or twice a week across our build system, so even if there weren't any failures in that period, one week isn't enough observation time.)

I haven't seen any occurrences since I removed {{runOrder}} from the configuration file, so I'm optimistic that removing that does fix the problem.  But it's certainly possible that switching to 2.19.1 had an effect as well.

I will check the parts of code as you mentioned. Version 2.19.x changed a lot so the behavior may differ from 2.18.1.
