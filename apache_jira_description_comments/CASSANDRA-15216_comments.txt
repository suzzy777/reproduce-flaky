I'd be interested in providing a patch. Could someone provide some pointers?

Thanks for the offer.  This is a two word change, though (from {{false}} to  {{true}}, in {{cassandra.yaml}} and {{Config}}), and probably too trivial to even bother with submission and review; it can probably be ninja'd in.  The only requirement is a brief discussion to confirm nobody disagrees this should happen.

[~benedict] The proposed change and reasoning looks good to me.

[~aleksey] [~ifesdjeen] [~JoshuaMcKenzie]  any thoughts?

[~e.dimitrova] go for it. We could have a wider discussion, but it's hard for me to imagine why someone would object to this default switch.

 

Just make sure to update NEWS.txt to note that the change has taken place.

Patch available for trunk [here|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/tree/trunk-CASSANDRA-15216]

[Pull request|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/pull/17]

Screenshots from the CI ran attached. If you look at the failures of "test all", there are some which I don't see when I am running CI on trunk but most of them are marked as flaky. I think it should be good. NEWS.txt updated as agreed earlier. 

Looks good to me (except you want to trim your CHANGES.txt entry to one shortish line preferably). If Brandon is a bit busy, I can +1 and commit myself - just lmk on Slack or here. Cheers.

I committed this yesterday, but did not trim the CHANGES.txt entry.
