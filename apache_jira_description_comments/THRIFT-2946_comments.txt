Thank you Nobuaki!
This is a great work you have done, testing and review is in progress.

Thank you Nobuaki!
This is a fantastic work and a great improvment for my long running dream, a cross test suite. I guess we can completely remove test/test.sh now, what do you think?

Good to hear you like it !
Yes, if you find it ok, then I think it's ready.

Small note for everyone is that you can run only what you need by supplying flags like:

{code}
$ test/test.py --server cpp,java --client nodejs
$ test/test.py --server nodejs --client cpp,
{code}

(Example is for those interested in nodejs only)

Maybe I should provide README.

adding a *make fail* target to update the known failures file

[~nsuke] Could you review the patch [^THRIFT-2946_add_make_fail.patch] ?

Sorry, didn't notice until now.

Although it seems that it's already merged, a possible concern is that single test run with {{--update-expected-failures=overwrite}} may exclude flaky tests that occasionally fail.
Tests that involve C++ http server or nodejs buffered transport are major examples of such flakiness.

To avoid this, running tests several times with {{--update-expected-failures=merge}} after the first {{--update-expected-failures=overwrite}} run might be a reasonable solution.
I think I can submit a patch myself shortly after.

Alternatively, manually tracking list of flaky tests may be better in that we don't need to run the whole test multiple times and then hope we are lucky enough to catch every occasional failures.
But I'm not sure it's worth the complexity and the work (i.e. manual maintenance of the list) it introduces.

edit:
It turned out c_glib were only failing for clang (THRIFT-3091).
I updated the pullrequest to include the patch because it's needed for the correct list anyway.
