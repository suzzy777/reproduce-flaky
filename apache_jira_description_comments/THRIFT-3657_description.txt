prioritySend is used in TFileWriterTransport close method.
A possible problem with this is that even synchronized calls that are strictly before close call can be ignored in rare occasions.

The author has put a comment "FIXME: Should use normal send here" and there's no reason not to.
I suspect it is a remnant of old implementation or local debug stuff.
