[~dionusos] I agree that using a random port number could cause problems.

The test is called testConnectionDrop and as far as I understand, it creates a BrokerService, stops it, creates a new one. Your patch removes the stopping and creating a new one part, so it does not check the drop anymore. Why is that? Could we keep this part from the original test?

Thanks for noticing this error [~asalamon74] . Sorry for that. :(
