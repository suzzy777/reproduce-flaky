+1, if a test is flaky, we should just apply {{AwaitsFix}}. 

It is really confusing today that you can apply this {{BadApple}} annotation and the tests still run by default anyways and will sporadically fail. Turning flaky tests off only in certain CI builds but still leaving them flaky for devs is wrong IMO.
