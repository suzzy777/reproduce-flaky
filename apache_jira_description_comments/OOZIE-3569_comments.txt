Please check this bug. [~asalamon74]. I will upload patch laterly

[~zuston] Yes, this is a bug, I also had a problem with it, but forgot to open a jira. Thanks for opening this jira, waiting for the patch.

Please review it. Thanks [~asalamon74]

Thanks for the patch [~zuston] I like this approach.

The success file checking is rather similar to the error file checking (which is good of course), could you please extract this to a new method?

Have you checked your modification in a working environment? We don't have a working ssh action unit test, so it would be important to check it.

[~asalamon74] OK, i will extract error file checking to a new method.

In the production environment, we are gradually applying this patch, but this change is harmful. If the SSH action was run before applying this patch, so the success file is not generated, then after the action ends, the success file will be checked, finally the action will be misjudged as a failure.

So I first added the touch success file, but the success file was not verified at the end of the action. After one week, I applying this patch completely with the checking success file strategy.

After 2 weeks of stable running,  I will reply here. 



[~asalamon74] I modified code and upload v2 patch according your suggestion. Please review it. According to our practice, this patch works well.

Thanks [~zuston] for the new patch, I like the change.

The harmfulness of this patch makes me wonder. [~gezapeti] Do we have some best practices for these kind of patches?

This would be a good improvement in the reliability of the ssh actions. We could call out the possibility of false errors during the upgrade from 5.2.0 to a higher version of Oozie because of this change in the docs: https://oozie.apache.org/docs/5.2.0/DG_SshActionExtension.html

We could add a small section about the creation of these files there as well.

*The harmfulness of this patch makes me wonder.*

This patch can’t upgrade smoothly. [~asalamon74]. See above for detailed reasons. 

Yes [~zuston] I understand the upgrade difficulty, that's why I asked [~gezapeti].

I think his suggestion is good. This is a very useful patch, we should only document this difficulty.

Could you please modify the documentation and add a small section which describes this files and also point out that Oozie 5.3.0 introduced the new file which might cause problems during update.

[~asalamon74] Of course, we use Oozie on a large scale in our production environment and accumulate some practice and experience.  I'm pleased to contribute to the community.

Closer to home, v3-patch was uploaded.

[~zuston] It's always great if someone contributes to the upstream community, thanks for that.

Seems to me the link is not correct in the documentation, you're linking to OOZIE-3574. Could you please check it.

Sorry, i fix it. [~asalamon74]
