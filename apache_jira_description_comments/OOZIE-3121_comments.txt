The full output of the test-patch run is available at

. https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-OOZIE-Build/209/

all tests pass locally, will address findbug issues in a separate jira.

I'm retargeting this to 5.0.0 so it's not blocking the 5.0-b1 release.
I'll look into the test failures because this looks way too many.
