The [Thrift-precommit|https://builds.apache.org/job/Thrift-precommit] job now runs in the build/docker/ubuntu container and the [lib/cpp/test/SecurityTest|https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/lib/cpp/test/SecurityTest.cpp] fails most - but not all - of the time.

Failures can be seen in the following jobs
* https://builds.apache.org/job/Thrift-precommit/60/console
* https://builds.apache.org/job/Thrift-precommit/59/console
* https://builds.apache.org/job/Thrift-precommit/58/console
