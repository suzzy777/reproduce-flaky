[~fredyw] I have assigned this ticket to you because you added the test in https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/10939/
Feel free to assign it back to me if you do not have time to deal with it at the moment.

I'll work on it.

IMPALA-7428: Fix flaky test_shell_command_line::test_large_sql

This patch fixes the flaky test by rewriting the test to perform a
large query from a non-existent table instead since the test focuses
on Impala shell performance and not Impala performance in general.
This patch also reduces the time limit from 30 seconds to 10 seconds
and increases the number of columns in the query to 10K.

Testing:
- Ran all shell tests
