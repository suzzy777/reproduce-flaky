These two tests don't pass. Turns out the cause was interesting.

We added a workaround for case where procedure WAL could have procs out of order.

HBASE-18216 [AMv2] Workaround for HBASE-18152, corrupt procedure WAL

If we find a procedure that is not 'increasing' -- of a later timestamp or procid -- then we'd skip the application of the 'old' proc. The workaround was until we figure in what scenarios we can write procedures out of order (seems to be rare and high-concurrency... TBD).

These two tests trip FAILs and ROLLBACKs (double delete of table or disable of an already disabled table). They are good tests. But procedures that get marked FAIL or ROLLEDBACK will have procids that are less than current. Makes it so we skipped adding the ROLLBACK and so finishing up the procedure.
