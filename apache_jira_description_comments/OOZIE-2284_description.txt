  OOZIE-2205 added support to not automatically add *-default.xml and *-site.xml to the actionConf (just pig and hive for now) and pick them from classpath of the hadoop node. This makes rolling upgrades work well as it will pick up latest config changes without having to upgrade Oozie server. But HBaseCredentials ends up adding the *-default.xml and *-site.xml to the actionConf.
