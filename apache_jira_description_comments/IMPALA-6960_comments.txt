Yep it looks like the profile for "Instance be45f2c7cbf5354f:44e7abd300000002 (host=ip-172-31-21-122:22000)" is empty.

Ideally we can fix IMPALA-6338 and solve all of these flakes. I'll keep this open to track this specific test - if it keeps failing in this place maybe we can mitigate it somehow.

I'll mark this as a dupe. If we see this specific failure happen again, I'll look at mitigating it.
