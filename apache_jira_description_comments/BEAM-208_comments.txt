This flakiness occurs due to the combination of using System.currentTimeMillis when assigning timestamps, the use of FixedWindows of 1 hour with no offset, and the assumption that the output will be in exactly one window. If a test run aligns on an hour boundary, certain elements may end up in a second window and thus show up in the output as a second element.
