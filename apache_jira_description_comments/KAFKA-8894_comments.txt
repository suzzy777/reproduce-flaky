stanislavkozlovski commented on pull request #7330: KAFKA-8894: Bump streams test topic deletion assertion timeout from 30s to 60s
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7330
 
 
   We have seen rare flakiness in this assertion - all of streams' internal topics would not get deleted within the 30 second window. Increasing to 60 seconds should reduce the occurrence.
