The {{BlockPlacementPolicy}} considers specific storages, but when the replica is written the DN {{VolumeChoosingPolicy}} is unaware of any preference or constraints from other policies affecting placement. This limits heterogeneity to the declared storage types, which are treated as fungible within the target DN. It should be possible to influence or constrain the DN policy to select a particular storage.
