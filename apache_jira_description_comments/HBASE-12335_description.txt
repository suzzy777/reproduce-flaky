I find that this test often fails; the assertion that running with read replicas should complete faster than without is usually false. I need to investigate further as to why this is the case and how we should tune it.

In the mean time, I'd like to change the test to assert instead on the average of the stdev across all the test runs in each category. Meaning, enabling this feature should reduce the overall latency variance experienced by the client.
