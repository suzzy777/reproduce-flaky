While running gradle unit tests, we found the test method LogValidatorTest.testCompressedV1 can fail sometimes. Upon investigation, it turns out the test method uses one set of timestamps, say t0, t1 and t2, for the records, while using a separate timestamp, say t3, for the "now" parameter when invoking the LogValidator.validateMessagesAndAssignOffsets method. The validateMessagesAndAssignOffsets validation method also takes a parameter timestampDiffMaxMs=1 second, that specifies the maximum allowed time different between t3 and the timestamps in records, i.e. t0, t1, and t2. While running unit tests, especially when multiple tests are run simultaneously, there is no guarantee that the time difference between t3 and t0 is within 1 second, causing the test method to flaky sometimes. Many other test methods in the LogValidatorTest can suffer from the same problem.
