I am not able to reproduce this one and I didn't see it anymore failing. I am un-assigning it as I work on different work now and someone else might want to try to work on it with more success in reproducing the problem. 

Looks super [stable|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/294/testReport/dtest-novnode.materialized_views_test/TestMaterializedViews/test_resume_stopped_build/history/] lately

Hi [~aholmber], Thanks for taking it!

When I raised the ticket there were no failures recorded in Jenkins. It was only a single failure observed only in CircleCI.

So just wanted to make a heads up that there might be a late commit which led to these Jenkins failures.Â 

Contrary to my deleted comment, the test still seems stable in Jenkins. I had fuzzy searched and found a test with a similar name failing.
This one is still showing "Stability 100%" in Jenkins [history|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/37/testReport/dtest-novnode.materialized_views_test/TestMaterializedViews/test_resume_stopped_build/].

Time to close for now?

I think we can close it then. I didn't manage to reproduce it and I haven't seen it failing anymore, I think enough time passed since then. (Anyone else?) Looks like timeout related to the infrastructure (not happening for the first time)

I'm assuming Berengeur still agrees with himself.
Closing for now. We can reopen if it crops up again.

+1 to closing flaky tests that happened once and never again.
