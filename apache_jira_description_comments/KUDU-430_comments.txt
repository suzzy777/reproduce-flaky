Also need to implement the following in consensus:
{code}
- Timestamps issued by quorum leaders must be disjoint, as specified in the
  Google Spanner paper [2] in section 4.1.1 and Appendix A. Therefore, when a
  new leader is elected, the leader must do a "commit-wait" style pause before
  replicating new writes.
{code}

Made this an umbrella ticket for timestamp/snapshot related issues.



David:

Last week finished timestamp propagation to replicas and reuse on replay but still hitting a couple of serialization issues on long tests, which I'm looking into.
Hope to finish most of the timestamp propagation stuff along with safe timestamp propagation and the doc by the time Todd comes back (since he's the one that has to +2 them).

David:
- Basically done, minor flakiness issues, tests are passing, next patch will have to be reviewed by Todd, already addressed Adar's review.
- Next, safe timestamp propagation between leader and replicas (even if nothing happens, still need to move the clock forward).

Safe time advancement and timestamp reuse were merged in e67c31a26e930a2bf186e6600132ea3d76b0c7da, the subtasks can now advance

David:
* Timestamp assignment is being moved to consensus, right now it's in transactions but consensus needs to be involved.
* Safe timestamps: hard to test, trying to come up with a good integration test.
* Working on KUDU-120, adding checks for flush, adding undos.
* This week: push the pre-requisite patch for KUDU-120, stretch is to fully push it. Also, working on not fsync'ing COMMIT message.

We should evaluate remaining work here, and if we think it's more than a week or two total, we should just doc the aberrations as known issues. Consistency isn't our #1 selling point in the initial beta release.

I pushed this to GA. We'll have to document where we fall short.

This JIRA is orthogonal to KUDU-1497 but they complement each other.
