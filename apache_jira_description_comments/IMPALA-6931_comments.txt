IMPALA-6931: reduces races in query expiration tests

Recent tests ran into flakiness when testing query expiration.
This change makes two changes:
1) query state is retrieved earlier; a flaky test skipped
the expected state.
2) bump the timing; a flaky test had queries expire before
it could check them
