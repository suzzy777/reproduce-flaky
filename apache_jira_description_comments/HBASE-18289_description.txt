Started looking into this today, spend about half the day, and couldn't finish it off, but am filing this JIRA so that I can record progress somewhere and maybe somebody else with more contextual knowledge can chime in.

I'll attach a truncated log file from one of the flaky job runs that focuses on only this test.

We enable the regions are down simulation at 16:31:30 in the file, and we can see that reads on the primary fail and then succeed on the replica for a while. There's a lot of stack traces starting at that point, so I have trouble keeping track of when exactly the replica disappears. Scans of the meta replica look like they work the whole time, it's the user table that fails.
