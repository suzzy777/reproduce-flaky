Looks to be due to the fact that a task submitted to an executor may not immediately begin execution even if capacity exists to do so. Repro's reliably when run in Docker with restricted cpu and adding a spin assert with a short timeout seems to fix it. It's probably of little value, but I've linked a Circle run with the medium config as in the original report.

Hi [~samt],

Thank you for the patch!

I will do a review later today.

One thing I was thinking around the flakiness - can you loop the test with the patch like 10 times(10 should be enough if it was failing consistently I guess) or something in your environment? (Or you already did that?) 

 

The patch looks good to me.  Unfortunately, we rely on timing, so as suggested in my previous comment, please, loop it to check for flakiness.

 

bq. can you loop the test with the patch like 10 times

yep, I did that already and saw no failures.

Thanks for the review [~e.dimitrova], committed to trunk in {{c6fc6714eea73d94e6befd13b52a15cd48e28f7a}} with the typo fixed.

Thank you [~samt]
