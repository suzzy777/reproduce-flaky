[~satishsaley] I believe the real problem is that 0 tests were executed and 0 out 0 failed, that's why... {{bin/test-patch-20-tests}} shall updated to detect this (i.e. number of executed test cases is not realistic). Regarding rerunning: could be done through Maven surefire since 2.19 , filed OOZIE-3148.
