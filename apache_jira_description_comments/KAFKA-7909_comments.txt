   KAFKA-7909: Coordinator changes to fix flakiness of Connect Integration Test
   
   This commit introduces a change and reverts a recent one. First, in
   GroupCoordinator, we attempt to complete JoinGroup when the last member
   joins. Second, we revert a recent change in AbstractCoordinator
   that changed how a Generation is determined to be valid. The second
   change is required in the following situation: a group of consumers
   are killed when they are in the midst of a JoinGroup operation, and
   the consumers that correctly initiated the JoinGroup request, that are
   just waiting for the last member(s) to join, try to LeaveGroup, but
   are unable to do so because they are not considered valid. If these
   consumers are restarted, these old consumers are still in the group, and the
   new JoinGroup never succeeds.

   After these changes, we are able to run the flaky [test](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/dc935c4/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/integration/ExampleConnectIntegrationTest.java#L105) more than 300 times without seeing any failures.
