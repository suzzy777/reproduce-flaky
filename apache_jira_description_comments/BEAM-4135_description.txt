The "engine" consists of the components which determine where to schedule work and route it to the appropriate processors, such as WatermarkManager, DirectBundleProcessor, and associated.

These engine components never inspect the actual characteristics of the packaged work (e.g. the PCollection is a token, rather than a rich object), so they should not require use of a PCollection directly - instead, they can be generic.
