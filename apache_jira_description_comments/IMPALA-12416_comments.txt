IMPALA-12416: Fix test failures caused by
IMPALA-11535

Fixed the test failures in Java unit tests caused by incorrectly
setting the config 'enable_sync_to_latest_event_on_ddls' to true. This
flag has to be reset to its original value at the end of the test since
BackendConfig.INSTANCE is shared by all the FE tests. Also, increased
the hms polling interval to 10sec for the test_skipping_older_events()
end-to-end test to avoid flakiness.
