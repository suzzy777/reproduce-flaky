Test is timing out here:Â [https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/runners/flink/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/runners/flink/translation/wrappers/streaming/io/UnboundedSourceWrapperTest.java#L354]

Thanks for reporting this. This should be fixed. Feel free to ping me here if it fails again.

[~mxm] timed out in https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Commit/11590/ which was a couple weeks after your comment. I cannot say if the root cause is related.

I'm reopening just because it is recent enough you probably have context on this.

And marking P1 due to flaky test policy.

Thanks Kenn. I was assuming a recent change to the shutdown behavior would also fix the flakiness but that doesn't seem to be the case. I'm going to take a look.

Closing because this is a duplicate of BEAM-9164.
