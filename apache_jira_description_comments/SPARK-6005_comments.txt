Looks virtually identical to SPARK-5731; same issue or just closely related?

Looks similar, but unless I miss something, that fix didn't fix this one. The failure I report is from a recent build that includes the fixes in 3912d332464dcd124c60b734724c34d9742466a4


[~cody@koeninger.org] Can you check this out?

Given lack of updates, and that I can't recall seeing this fail in recent memory, resolving.
