[~nobigo] ，you do not need to change the fixed version. It would be set when the new release is realsed.

[~Chunwei Lei]  Sorry. Thanks for your reminder. I will check the merged issue lately.

Hi [~Chunwei Lei], [~nobigo], actually when an issue is marked as resolved the fix version should be set (see [merging guidelines|https://calcite.apache.org/docs/howto.html#merging-pull-requests]) otherwise the release manager cannot know what was resolved in this release.  

Oops, thank you for your kindly reminder, [~zabetak] .  Sorry for the wrong tip, [~nobigo] .

Resolved in release 1.29.0 (2021-12-26)
