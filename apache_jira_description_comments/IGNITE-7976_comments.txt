Hi [~alex_pl], 

Is it possible to prepare the fix relatevely quickly? 

Or is it worth while to disable this test?

Sincerely,

[~dpavlov] fix is ready. Some tests on TC are still not passed (due to another flaky tests). I hope today I will move ticket to PA.

[~alex_pl], Thank you. Let's keep test non-muted.
