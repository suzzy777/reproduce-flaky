Flink needs access to shared storage.

In many cases, this is HDFS, but it would be nice to also support file URIs on an mounted NFS for example.

Mesos exposes APIs for adding volumes, so it should be relatively simply to add this.

As an example, here is the spark code for supporting volumes: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/resource-managers/mesos/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/cluster/mesos/MesosSchedulerBackendUtil.scala#L35
