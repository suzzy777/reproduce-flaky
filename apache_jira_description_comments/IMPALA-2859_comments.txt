Filed JIRAs for separate failures: IMPALA-2871, IMPALA-2872

The build now succeeds aside from a known flaky test: IMPALA-2870

PromiseTest still throws an exception


IMPALA-2859: don't use DCHECK in unit tests

DCHECKs are removed in release mode, so it is incorrect to use them in
unit tests that will be run in release mode. This caused promise-test to
randomly fail, since a function call was wrapped in a DCHECK and
therefore removed by the preprocessor in release mode.

This patch converts all DCHECKs in unit tests to either ASSERT (where
possible) or EXPECT (otherwise). In one place we use EXPECT_TRUE(... !=
...) because EXPECT_NE tries to take the address of a constant.
