URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6475
 
 
   ## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
   
   Fix flaky test cases in `WorkerTest` by mocking the `ExecutorService` in `Worker`.  Previously, when using a real thread pool executor, the task may or may not have been run by the executor until the end of the test.
