    Thanks - why did you remove jdk9?


Github user acoburn commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-tamaya/pull/24
  
    I replaced jdk9 with jdk11 since jdk9 is already obsolete. Would you prefer to continue testing under jdk9? Or perhaps test on jdk8, jdk10 and jdk11?

TAMAYA-349: Cleanup travis build file

    mmmh - build seems to fail on various JDKs:
    https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/431841974/log.txt
    https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-tamaya-sandbox/jobs/431841974
    
    Any connection to your changes?!


Github user acoburn commented on the issue:

    It seems that the failures are related to the Vertex tests, which I've seen to be inconsistent. That is, they often pass but sometimes fail for no apparent reason. I believe this has more to do with timing than the particular JDK the test is run on.


Github user peculater commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-tamaya-sandbox/pull/8
  
    I've seen the Vertex tests be flaky in my own work on jdk 8, but I don't know much about what it's trying to do or why it's flaky.
