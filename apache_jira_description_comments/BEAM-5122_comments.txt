Synced with Anton. He suggested to disable the test for now while he is working on proper fix.

Another timeout but for a different test (PubsubJsonIT.testSQLLimit). Should we disable this test as well ?

Can you please take a look?

This issue is assigned but has not received an update in 30 days so it has been labeled "stale-assigned". If you are still working on the issue, please give an update and remove the label. If you are no longer working on the issue, please unassign so someone else may work on it. In 7 days the issue will be automatically unassigned.

Re-opening this. I just re-enabled the test in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12750.

I'll monitor over the next week to see if it increases flakiness, if it does I'll @ignore it again and use this jira to track the fix. If it doesn't I'll resolve this jira.

This issue was marked "stale-assigned" and has not received a public comment in 7 days. It is now automatically unassigned. If you are still working on it, you can assign it to yourself again. Please also give an update about the status of the work.

Looks like this hasn't flaked since re-enabling (https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_SQL/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/junit/org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.sql.meta.provider.pubsub/PubsubJsonIT/testUsesDlq/history/). Closing the ticket now.
