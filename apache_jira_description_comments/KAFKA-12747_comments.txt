Looks like this test is flaky because it assumes no two UUIDs have the same prefix, where the prefix is only the first four digits of the UUID (which of course greatly cuts down on the UUID's probability of uniqueness). We can fix this up by just testing both UUIDs to see if the prefix should apply to just one of the entries in the RocksDBStore, or both.

I'd like to try to solve this one.
