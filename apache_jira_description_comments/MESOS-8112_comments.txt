{{ContentType/AgentAPITest.GetContainers/1}} might also be fallout from the same changes in MESOS-7963

The first failure in this test run is {{../../src/tests/default_executor_tests.cpp:1460: Failed to wait 15secs for failed}}. This indicates that we got the {{starting}} and {{running}} status updates but the final {{failure}} took too long.

However, the master forwarded the {{RUNNING}} update here:

{noformat}

So from the master's perspective, the test framework disconnected? Or did this happen once the test failed and we started tearing it down?

Later in the test log:
{noformat}
../../src/tests/default_executor_tests.cpp:1427: Failure
Actual function call count doesn't match EXPECT_CALL(*scheduler, update(_, _))...
         Expected: to be called twice
           Actual: called once - unsatisfied and active
{noformat}

This seems to indicate that we only got 1 of 3 expected status updates, but if that was true I would expect to see a failure on {{AWAIT_READY(running)}} and I can't find that here :(

{{GetContainers}} should be fixed by [ab3728f |https://github.com/apache/mesos/commit/ab3728f3adcd199cc0dd9c481a2946efffacdb0d] and [439825f|https://github.com/apache/mesos/commit/439825f9e1a8339f040d816c6424dd0aeb69e304].

[~jpeach@apache.org], Don't be confused by the number of expected status updates: {{TASK_STARTING}} change has been introduced in-between. 

Regarding the failure, it looks like  he agent started to cleanup the offending container 90s after limitation was reached!
