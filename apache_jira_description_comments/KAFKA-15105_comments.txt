I would like to work on this issue. I'm still trying to understand how the build infrastructure works. Can someone give me a hint, how to reproduce the behavior?

Hi [~riedelmax], feel free to assign this issue to yourself :)

In this rely part of the problem, many times these issues are not easily reproducible on your machine. Usually they occur on CI.

The test itself is under the core module, so one way to try to reproduce it would be running `./gradlew core:test` or `./gradlew core:test --tests integration.kafka.server.FetchFromFollowerIntegrationTest.testFetchFromLeaderWhilePreferredReadReplicaIsUnavailable`repeatedly until failure. IntelliJ (if you have it and use it) has a similar feature where one can run a test until failure.

Is this answering your question? Or you wanted to know some other specific details?

Hi [~josep.prat]Â 
Thanks for giving me the necessary Jira rights. I was able to assign the ticket to me now.

So far, all test runs I did on my local environment passed. But I will try the option to run until failure and see what I can learn from that.

My question was about the CI. Is it correct that we are not able to rerun builds there or get more detailed output? I couldn't find the error message "Topic '__consumer_offsets' already exists." in the standard output of the test run

Hi [~riedelmax] ,

Only maintainers + a subgroup of collaborators can rerun builds in CI, but even for them, they can just run them as they are (no more detailed output). And sorry, I just realized I copy pasted the wrong ci build link. This is the right one: [https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka-pr/job/PR-13865/2/testReport/junit/integration.kafka.server/FetchFromFollowerIntegrationTest/Build___JDK_11_and_Scala_2_13___testFetchFromLeaderWhilePreferredReadReplicaIsUnavailable___2/]

I'm updating the description of the Jira issue.+
