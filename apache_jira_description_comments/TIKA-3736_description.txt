We are fairly frequently getting build fails on SolrPipesIterator tests. Specifically, the right number of docs are not indexed.  This is sometimes with zk and sometimes not. I can't tell if this is a race condition...er, the docs are sent to solr but not yet committed, or if something else is going wrong.

Here's the most recent from a failed github action build:
