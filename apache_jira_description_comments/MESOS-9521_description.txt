The recently added test {{MasterAPITest.OperationUpdatesUponAgentGone}} is flaky, e.g.,
{noformat}../src/tests/api_tests.cpp:5051: Failure
Value of: resources.empty()
  Actual: true
Expected: false
../3rdparty/libprocess/src/../include/process/gmock.hpp:504: Failure
Actual function call count doesn't match EXPECT_CALL(filter->mock, filter(to, testing::A<const MessageEvent&>()))...
    Expected args: message matcher (32-byte object <A0-5E 83-06 00-00 00-00 24-00 00-00 00-00 00-00 24-00 00-00 00-00 00-00 41-63 74-75 61-6C 20-66>, 1-byte object <A0>)
         Expected: to be called once
           Actual: never called - unsatisfied and active
{noformat}

I am able to reproduce this reliable in less than 10 iterations when running the test in repetition under additional system stress.

Even if the test does not fail it produces the following gmock warning,
{noformat}

GMOCK WARNING:
Uninteresting mock function call - returning directly.
    Function call: disconnected()
