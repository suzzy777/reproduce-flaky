I think it could be useful to have an optional CircleCI job to run some specific tests n times. That way, tickets could attach CircleCI runs showing that the changes don't make a certain ticket flaky or, conversely, that they fix a flaky test. Doing this systematically should mitigate the risk of introducing new flaky tests, and I guess it would be more convenient and easy to share than running the tests locally or on a private CI system.

It would also be nice to have something similar in Jenkins, but I'm focusing this ticket on CircleCI because it's available also for non-committers, so assignees can run their tests before setting the tickets as ready for review.
