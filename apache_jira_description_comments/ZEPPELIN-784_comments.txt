While {{src/tests/resources}} directory is included in our source release, i think binary (.jar) can not be there. Will there be any other solutions?

I think it's ok to put to {{src/test/resources/}} a small .jar file, in case it's needed for our tests. After all this is a particular kind of tests that load dependencies, so it make sense to keep them to reduce flakiness. What do you think?

Even though it's for testing and the binary is small, i'm not sure it's good idea to have binary in the source release.
(also it's bit hard to say what size is small)

As an alternative, we can leverage cache capability of travis to reduce the network error. What do you think?

Do we have any update on this ticket ?

Are we going to leverage the cache capability in Travis ?
