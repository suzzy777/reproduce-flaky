The test concurrently runs iterations of gfsh commands to deploy and undeploy .jar's from 3 gfsh clients to the same server, then waits up to 5 minutes for the gfsh clients to finish. Sometimes in the CI pipelines one or more of the clients don't complete their iterations within the 5 minute wait.

Test timing and/or client iterations needs to be adjusted for variations in machine and network speed.
