I was trying out email action executor. I've made sure that I'd set all the properties on oozie-site.xml and in the workflow definition too. Please find below the details I set, the stack trace and some of my findings. Any advice on how to resolve this would be really appreciated.

Details set:
host = smtp.gmail.com

port = 587

both to and from are gmail addresses...

oozie.email.smtp.auth = true

oozie.email.smtp.username = same as From address(Gmail ID)

oozie.email.smtp.password = <password>

Stack trace:

Findings:

I was able to develop a standalone class using javax.mail and send emails successfully...The only difference I could see is I'm setting the following property additionally in my standalone test:
props.put("mail.smtp.starttls.enable", "true");

If I dont set this property, my standalone example also fails with the same exception as Oozie does.
