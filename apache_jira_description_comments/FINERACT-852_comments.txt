This is still happening, e.g. on [https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/fineract/builds/674153587] which was for [https://github.com/apache/fineract/compare/c9a1b38b0ea2...26b619eea70e] from [https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/719] for FINERACT-809 which I think is unlikely to have directly caused this, so I'm assuming it must be "flaky".

[FINERACT-885|https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-885] has an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in another test, perhaps these are related?

[FINERACT-723|https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-723] has something interesting that may be related to this? Even though in [https://github.com/apache/fineract/blob/develop/.travis.yml#L42] we set {{export TZ=Asia/Kolkata}}.

This happened again today to 3 of my PRs:
{code:java}
org.apache.fineract.integrationtests.ClientSavingsIntegrationTest > testSavingsAccount_DormancyTracking FAILED    java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at ClientSavingsIntegrationTest.java:1977 {code}
It's interesting that line 1977 of ClientSavingsIntegrationTest has nothing that should be causing an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.. there is only a catch (InterruptedException e) and e.printStackTrace() - this doesn't make any sense?!

[https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/761] proposes to {{@Ignore}} the ClientSavingsIntegrationTest > testSavingsAccount_DormancyTracking ... but that PR itself failed, due to:
{code:java}
org.apache.fineract.integrationtests.SchedulerJobsTest > testSchedulerJobs FAILED    java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at SchedulerJobsTest.java:116 {code}
and in that case, the {{ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException}} makes a lot more sense now... I'm just very puzzled what could possibly mix up these two tests like that?

Let's first try to ignore this one, without ClientSavingsIntegrationTest, and see if that helps... so proposed in https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/764.

Could it be that Scheduler Job itself is broken somewhere as reported here:Â [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-894]

Both ClientSavingsIntegrationTest and SchedulerJobsTest have no Ignore anymore and seem to working well now (after some of my and/or Petri's recent work), so closing this.

> Both ClientSavingsIntegrationTest and SchedulerJobsTest have no Ignore anymore

neither {{@Disabled}} which is what we actually use now ;) with JUnit 5 instead of {{@Ignore}} like we used to with JUnit 4.
