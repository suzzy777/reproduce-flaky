The {{Utilities.getInputSummary}} method has a configuration to use multiple threads to get the content summary of tables and partitions. This configuration variable, {{mapred.dfsclient.parallelism.max}}, is disabled by default and there are no tests that validate the quality of using multi threads.

This JIRA is used to add tests to such method with multiple threads and fix any issue found.
