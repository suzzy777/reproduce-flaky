Returning variable substituted properties via iterator() breaks phoenix.

This version does not perform variable substitution on the properties returned by iterator(), as this seems to break Phoenix.

I have added asMap() to the unit tests, so that it now checks for the fixed behaviour.

I am pretty sure that release audit and core problems found by the bot are unrelated to my changes.

Looking at the past few test runs, the UpgradeIT test seems to be flaky, while the release audit warnings are about files that I have not touched.
