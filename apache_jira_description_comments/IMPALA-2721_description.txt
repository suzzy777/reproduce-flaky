impala-master-code-coverage-cdh5 has been broken since Nov16 due to failure of 3 timing sensitive tests. [~henryr] mentioned that [~mgrund_impala_bb91] knew what's going on. The first failure also seemed to overlap with jenkins switching to using a different toolchain. Not sure if python version was changed or if the toolchain change brought out latent bugs in some flaky tests but it would be great if [~mgrund_impala_bb91] can take a look first.
