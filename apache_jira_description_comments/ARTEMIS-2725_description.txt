Some tests are asynchronously flaky, mainly when you add slower boxes or have longer GC cycles running on long running tests.

 

For that reason I'm adding a profile called tests-retry

 

Which will activate the optional Rule called RetryRule(defaultRetries=?)

which can be used in conjunction with @RetryMethod(retries=?)


please use it only if you must. Try to fix the test first.
