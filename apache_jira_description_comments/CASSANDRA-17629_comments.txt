Hm, I think 100 runs of the test to confirm being not flaky anymore is low. Normally I test at least 500

I don't think it matters in this instance, it doesn't fail on circle.  But as I said on 17606, waiting for schema is correct regardless, so it's some kind of progress. :)

This isn't actually as I first thought with CASSANDRA-17606 a schema issue, or at least not one there is control over.  This is happening when 2.2 is [checking for existing roles|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.2/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/auth/CassandraRoleManager.java#L388] and the schema for them hasn't been loaded on the receiving node yet.

On node3:
{noformat}
WARN  [MessagingService-Incoming-/127.0.0.1] 2022-05-18 18:36:04,397 IncomingTcpConnection.java:100 - UnknownColumnFamilyException reading from socket; closing
org.apache.cassandra.db.UnknownColumnFamilyException: Got slice command for nonexistent table system_auth.roles.  If the table was just created, this is likely due to the schema not being fully propagated.  Please wait for schema agreement on table creation.
{noformat}

On node2, about a second later:
{noformat}
INFO  [OptionalTasks:1] 2022-05-18 18:36:05,660 CassandraRoleManager.java:378 - Created default superuser role 'cassandra'
{noformat}

If anything, this is a bug in 2.2 but it's not relevant now so I've added this to the ignore fixture [here|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/tree/CASSANDRA-17629].  I'll check back when the 500 circle runs that are going [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/489/workflows/ee33f6d5-e4a9-4021-aed5-a92a32ced896] finish.

CI looks good.

I think this will solve CASSANDRA-17627 as well.

LGTM +1

Committed, thanks!
