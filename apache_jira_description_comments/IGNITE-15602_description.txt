The TcpDiscoveryKubernetesIpFinder hard wires the port passed to the KubernetesServiceAddressResolver to 0, rather than a configurable DiscoveryPort specified in KubernetesConnectionConfiguration. This means if there is a client to more than one grid deployed to Kubernetes, that client can only see one of the grids due to the port being hard wired to 0 causing it to use the default port to locate the grid to join.

 

KubernetesConnectionConfiguration should define a property, DiscoveryPort, which the Ignite Kubernetes finder can use to locate a grid deployed in Kubernetes. 

 This work item makes the following changes:
 * Adds a DiscoveryPort property to KubernetesConnectionConfiguration
 * Passes that DiscoveryPort configuration value to the KubernetesServiceAddressResolver
