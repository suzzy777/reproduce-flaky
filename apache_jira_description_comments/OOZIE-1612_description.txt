We were recently looking into an issue and noticed that the same log message had printed different date objects with different timezones, which makes it hard to compare the two.  Which leads to the bigger picture, which is that we should be printing any Date objects in log messages with the {{oozie.processing.timezone}} timezone (there's a method for that in {{DateUtils}}).
