This is a sub-task for ZEPPELIN-1344. The deliverable will be a custom matplotlib backend which natively supports inline plotting in zeppelin notebook cells (for the python and eventually pyspark interpreters). More information regarding matplotlib backends can be found here:

http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend

The focus of this issue will be getting support for plotting just static images similar to those generated in a Jupyter notebook cell when {{%matplotlib inline}} is used. Getting support for more interactive plotting will also require a custom backend that will be based off of this one.
