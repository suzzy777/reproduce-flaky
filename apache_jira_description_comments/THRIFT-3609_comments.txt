    lib/cpp/test/SecurityTest is flaky in jenkins Thrift-precommit build.

    Previously, the server socket might not be fully closed from a prior
    test, leading to flaky port bind failures in CI.  Avoid the issue
    altogether by binding an ephemeral port.
    
    Add a TODO to TestPortFixture.h to warn folks away from its usage
    and link THRIFT-3609 to track the work of removing or replacing it.
