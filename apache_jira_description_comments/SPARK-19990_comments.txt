the root cause is [the csvfile path in this test case|https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/command/DDLSuite.scala#L703] is "jar:file:/home/jenkins/workspace/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-2.6/sql/core/target/spark-sql_2.11-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar!/test-data/cars.csv", which will failed when new Path() [new Path in datasource.scala |https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/DataSource.scala#L344]

and the cars.csv are stored in module core's resources.

after we merge the HiveDDLSuit and DDLSuit  in SPARK-19235   https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/09829be621f0f9bb5076abb3d832925624699fa9ï¼Œif we test module hive, we will run the DDLSuit in the core module, and this will cause that we get the illegal path like 'jar:file:/xxx' above.

it is not related with SPARK-19763

I will fix this by providing a new test dir which contain the test files in sql/ , and the test case use this file path.

thanks~
