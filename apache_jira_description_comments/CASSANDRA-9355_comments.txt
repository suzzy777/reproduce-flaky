This test looks like it passes in trunk, currently.

[~mshuler] is it still relevant?

This does appear to fail periodically:
http://cassci.datastax.com/job/cassandra-2.1_utest_compression/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.db/RecoveryManagerTruncateTest/history/

I added a CL sync to each test before the reset and recovery since the others have been flaky historically.

It looks like the CL replayer looked for the sync entry and the sync entry is only written if there is a sync.

Assigning to Benedict for review since he is familiar with the CL and this isn't a rush job.

Posted my comment that precedes the patch submission under CASSANDRA-9358 and also misnamed the branch. Will fix it. Here is the comment.

Adding a commit log sync before reseting and restoring from PIT fixes this test. It's not super reproducible on my Linux box although it will happen in a loop. On OS X it fails pretty reliably.

I am going to dig a little deeper into why a sync is necessary for the commit log contents to be usable. 

When it fails I see this in the log
{code}
    [junit] WARN  17:32:49 Encountered bad header at position 16 of commit log /home/aweisberg/cassandra/build/test/cassandra/commitlog:0/CommitLog-4-1446831167254.log, with invalid CRC. The end of segment marker should be zero.

{code}

We only replay mutations up to the last correct sync header, mutations made after that will follow an empty or invalid sync header which is treated as an end marker. I think this was done to ensure we don't replay data from the previous write cycle on this segment when they were being reused.

The test is not failing in 2.2 and later, because a sync is part of closing the segment during CommitLog shutdown. 2.1 will also sync once after shutdown is requested, but not during {{resetUnsafe}} as used by tests. Perhaps a more thorough solution is to include a sync (and wait for it to complete) as part of the latter?

We could try that. It's a pretty invasive change in that tests that weren't expecting a sync would be getting a sync and might no longer test what they were expecting to test.

Alternate version

The links don't appear to be pointing to the right place (did the push succeed?).

Sorry wrong branch name

Both options look good to me. I personally prefer the latter as that's what we do in 2.2+, but it's up to you to choose the one to go with.

It's not 100% clear from the comments above which branch exactly is "ready to commit". Is that https://github.com/aweisberg/cassandra/commits/CASSANDRA-9355-2.1-v2 ?

We are going to go with v2 (the one you linked). Also only merging this to 2.1 as it appears to pass in later versions.

I did accidentally put 'reviewed by Aleksey Yeschenko' instead of 'reviewed by Branimir Lambov' in the commit message. My apologies to [~blambov].
