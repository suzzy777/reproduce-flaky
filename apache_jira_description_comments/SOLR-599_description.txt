SolrJ provides a SolrServer implementation backed by commons-httpclient which introduces many dependency jars (commons-codec, commons-io and commons-logging). Apart from that SolrJ also uses StAX API for XML parsing which introduces dependencies like stax-api, stax and stax-utils.

This enhancement will add a SolrServer implementation backed by java.net.HttpUrlConnection and will use BinaryResponseParser as the default response parser. Using this basic implementation out of the box would require no dependencies on either commons-httpclient or StAX. The only dependency would be on solr-commons making this a very lightweight and distribution friendly Java client for Solr.
