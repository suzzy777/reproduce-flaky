ServicesTest.TestDeploy(False):
Sometimes service is cancelled immediately after deployment. Not sure if this is caused by a failure in Execute method, which in turn is caused by failed "Assert.IsFalse(Cancelled);". There might be a race on Cancelled property. I've added locks to check this assumption.

BinaryCompactFooterInteropTest.TestFromJava(True):
This happens purely on Java side. Reproduced in a Java test, filed IGNITE-4377.

* ReconnectTest.TestClusterRestart, ReconnectTest.TestFailedConnection, ExecutableTest.TestInvalidCmdArgs fixed (increased timeouts).

* TestLockSimple - never failed in master.

* EntityFrameworkCacheTest.*Multithreaded - reduce duration to avoid overloading SQL CE.



Reopened, current test issues:
* Possible hang in examples tests
* TestClusterRestart is flaky


TestClusterRestart fixed; IGNITE-4494 created to address examples test issue.

TestClusterRestart still fails, investigating.
