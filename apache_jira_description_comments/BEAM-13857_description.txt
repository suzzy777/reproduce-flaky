Currently a separate debezium io expansion address flag needs to be passed to the runner when running cross-language debezium IO pipelines from Go SDK. Find a way to do this in a better way so that we could have it started along with java io expansion service while spinning up the test without bulking :sdks:java:io:expansion-service.

In particular, needing to add a flag per expansion service jar to our integration tests will eventually become quite cluttered, so we may wish to settle on some kind of KV map flag approach instead to reduce copypasta code overhead.

Edit: Decided on going with the KV map flag approach within the Go SDK instead of in a bash script, and moving expansion service startup into the codebase as well.
