We have several tests that rely on TestPubsubSignal.signalStart as an imperfect signal that a pipeline has created a subscription to a PubSub topic, and it is safe for us to start injecting data. This has the potential to be flaky.

We should instead poll pubsub until we can observe a subscription was created. This can be implemented via a method TestPubsub.waitForSubscription
