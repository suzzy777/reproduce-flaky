Create a sample project that can help get users started with .NET and Gremlin. Should probably be added to the series of gremlin-archetype projects. It seems .NET already has something analogous to archetypes with "dotnet templates". I'm not sure how those work or are built/deployed/distributed but we would probably want to ensure that those aspects are somehow still handled by maven if we can.
