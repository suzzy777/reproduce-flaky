We worked on router based federation security as part of HDFS-13532. We kept it compatible with the way namenode works. However with HADOOP-16314 and HDFS-16354 in trunk, auth filters seems to have been changed causing tests to fail.

Changes are needed appropriately in RBF, mainly fixing broken tests.
