More info about the error (from pytest output, which I ran in circleci):

{noformat}
>       assert 'Live: 6' in out_node1_dc1
E       AssertionError: assert 'Live: 6' in 'Cluster Information:\n\tName: test\n\tSnitch: org.apache.cassandra.locator.PropertyFileSnitch\n\tDynamicEndPointSnitc...ons:\n\t\t185761b8-eaf9-3380-8e13-45e608976901: [127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3, 127.0.0.4, 127.0.0.5, 127.0.0.6]\n\n'

Consistently failing for cassandra 2.2, 3.0, and 3.11. Haven't researched why trunk is passing.

The problem is because CASSANDRA-13853 is only committed to 4.0. Adding {{@since('4.0')}}:
[diff: 14484 |https://github.com/cooldoger/cassandra-dtest/tree/14484]
Please review.

The test is flaky in trunk:

I'm +1 on [~jay.zhuang]'s patch.

wrt to the timeout he observed, I ran this dtest on my laptop and ended getting a different flaky behavior. I will open up a new ticket for that in order to unblock this patch (and get non-trunk patches closer to green). Updating title of this ticket, as well.

Thanks [~jasobrown] for the review. Patch is committed as [bed040c|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/commit/bed040c543b25984d9bcaf87e597fc1315b59008].
