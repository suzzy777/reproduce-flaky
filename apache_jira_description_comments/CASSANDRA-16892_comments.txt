I ran the patched {{upgrade_tests/thrift_upgrade_test.py}} using the repeated_upgrade_dtest runner 100 times and did not get any failure. Results are [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/blerer/cassandra/195/workflows/a9c26e1f-01e6-4af5-84c3-a0314c08ed59].

The fix looks good. +1

Thanks for the patch [~stefan.miklosovic]
