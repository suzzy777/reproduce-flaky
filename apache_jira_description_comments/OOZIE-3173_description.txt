Using a coordinator with cron based {{frequency}}, when in catchup mode (job is still in {{PREP}}), {{startTime}} lies in the past, next materialize time lies also in the past), would create only one action, independent of {{throttle}} value.

As many actions should be created in catchup mode, as many times {{frequency}} would fit in between {{startTime}}, {{Math.min(Math.min(now, endTime), startTime + frequency * throttle)}}.

Some examples, {{frequency="0 * * * *"}}:
* when between {{startTime}} and {{endTime}} there are 10 hours, both lie in the past, and {{throttle}} is {{1}} -> one action should be created
* when between {{startTime}} and {{endTime}} there are 10 hours, both lie in the past, and {{throttle}} is {{3}} -> three actions should be created
* when between {{startTime}} and {{endTime}} there are 10 hours, both lie in the past, and {{throttle}} is {{15}} -> ten actions should be created
