The problem in this test (and perhaps other flaky test which fail in the same way) is that creating the superuser may happen too late, actually after we try to connect to the cluster with the driver. In this case, we end up with exceptions like that. 

I managed to reproduce this problem by increasing {{cassandra.superuser_setup_delay_ms}} to 30 seconds.

My plan to fix this is to make the tests wait at most {{cassandra.superuser_setup_delay_ms}}, asserting the existence of the superuser (for the distributed tests), and reducing that delay to 0 for the unit tests.

Yes. There appear to be many tests which do that already. For example: [https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/test/distributed/org/apache/cassandra/distributed/test/UpdateSystemAuthAfterDCExpansionTest.java#L118]

I wonder if dtests should just always set the delay to 0.
