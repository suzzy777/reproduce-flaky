I haven't been able to identify from the Netty docs which was the lowest version where JDK17 was added but we are about 40 versions behind in netty 4 so I suspect we better update. 

-We need to consider there was an issue with class cast exceptions when building with JDK17 with newer versions of netty (the newest available in March 2022). For the record, we didn't see those when running CI on JDK8 and JDK11. We also need to carefully revise the changes between the netty versions. -->- CASSANDRA-18180

Upgrading will cover also a fix in netty that was discussed in [this|https://the-asf.slack.com/archives/CK23JSY2K/p1665567660202989] ASF Slack thread.
