Unfortunately with this patch I introduced a duplicated configuration of Surefire plugin in hadoop-common/pom.xml, effectively discarding a part of configuration. Attaching a patch which fixes this.

Hey Andrey, thanks a lot for noticing this and providing a fix. Since this is a newly-discovered bug, I think we should open a new JIRA for this change.

Good point, I'll open a separate one. Thanks.

HADOOP-9242 is created to track the additional fix
