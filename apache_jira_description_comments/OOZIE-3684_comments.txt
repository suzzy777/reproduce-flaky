Commit 87b812465fb05d2b77230a58bc1bf49bb86acdd3 in oozie's branch refs/heads/master from Denes Bodo
[ https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=oozie.git;h=87b812465 ]

OOZIE-3684 Migrate to commons-lang3 again (jmakai via dionusos)


Thanks [~jmakai] noticing this. Your change is merged to master.

We may need to implement a precommit check to see if there are any duplicated dependencies and if they are allowed (like commons lang is different on package level between lang and lang3) then we should ensure we use the latest version in Oozie.

Thank you :)
