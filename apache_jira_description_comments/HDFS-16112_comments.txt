Hi [~sodonnell], these unit test TestDecommissioningStatusWithBackoffMonitor#testDecommissionStatus and TestDecommissioningStatus#testDecommissionStatus recently seems a little flaky, could you please take a look when you have time. Thanks a lot.

This was fixed by [HDFS-16171|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-16171].

Hi [~weichiu] [~tasanuma] [~ferhui] , may I ask how to close this issue? Thanks.

closed it for you. You are already granted contributor privilege and you should be able to close it yourself (that is my understanding)

Thanks [~weichiu] for your help.
