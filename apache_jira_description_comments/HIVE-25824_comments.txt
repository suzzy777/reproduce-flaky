Apache Beam is also using 2.3.x, we'd be interested in a patched 2.3 release with log4j dependency bumped to 2.17.0

[~elukey] Feel free to create a PR for this and I can help review & merge: what man package failures did you encounter?

BTW the latest version in branch-2.3 is 2.3.10.

[~csun] Hi! Thanks a lot :)

Filed https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/2908, I added the build failure in its conversation.

[~csun] Hi! If you have time to help: for some reason I end up in a a no-class-def issue with the new patch (while testing 2.3.6 in some environments) - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-3619

I am still not able to reproduce with the Apache Bigtop's testing Docker images, any suggestion? I checked the datanucleus jars, they are there and they contain the .class files needed (I also checked that they are included in the Hive metastore's classpath inspecting the STARTUP_MSG log).

Found the issue, it was liblog4j-extras1.2-java (on Debian) added to the classpath by mistake.
