Based off several mailing list threads (see "[POLL] Vector type for ML”, "[DISCUSS] New data type for vector search”, and "Adding vector search to SAI with heirarchical navigable small world graph index”), its desirable to add a new type “VECTOR” that has the following properties

1) fixed length array
2) elements may not be null
3) flatten array (aka multi-cell = false)
