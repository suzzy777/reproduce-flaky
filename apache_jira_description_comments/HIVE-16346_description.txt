Right now, a lot of the logic in {{Hive.java}} attempts to set permissions of different files that have been moved / copied. This is only triggered if {{hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms}} is set to true.

However, on blobstores such as S3, there is no concept of file permissions so these calls are unnecessary, which can hurt performance.

One solution would be to set {{hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms}} to false, but this would be a global change that affects an entire HS2 instance. So HDFS tables will no longer have permissions inheritance.

A better solution would be to make the inheritance of permissions conditional on the target filesystem.
