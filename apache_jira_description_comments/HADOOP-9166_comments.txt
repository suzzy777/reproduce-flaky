This should be rebased on hadoop-minikdc.  This comment, if true, implies another jira should be filed so a test isn't required to work around another bug:
{quote}
// NB: must interrupt several times 
// because there are Thread#join() invocations in Shell.execCommand()
// that can "eat" the interrupted status:
{quote}

patch reworked to MiniKdc. 
1) apacheds version used in MiniKdc module advanced to 2.0.0-M16-SNAPSHOT because only this version has enough client part (Kinit). Dependencies are changed accordingly.
2) test checking ticket renewal thread in UserGroupInformation dropped because it's too difficult to make that functionality work with MiniKdc.
