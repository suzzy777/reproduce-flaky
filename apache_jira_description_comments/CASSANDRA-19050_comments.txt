Added trunk PR and failures seem TCM merge related. Do you agree [~mck]? if you do I'll merge

could you post the CI results please?

They're in the PRs.

Wanted to mention that TCM merge related tests are [documented|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-19055], and there are rather few of them by now. If you see any failure that is not in the list, thereâ€™s a chance it is not TCM related. There have been flakes we have fixed that existed in trunk, too.

I suggest in this interim period, we list test failures and cross-reference them against the TCM list. For example, org.apache.cassandra.index.sai.cql.StorageAttachedIndexDDLTest#concurrentTruncateWithIndexBuilding-oa_jdk17 does not seem to be TCM related, and there is an issue open about it: [CASSANDRA-19032]. Another that looks like unfamiliar one is https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/1122/workflows/31c7e520-ca04-4278-b0c8-a9fa32b3a0f9/jobs/34616/tests I have not checked all pipelines, but this is something that stood out. Does not seem to be broken because of this patch though. 

I just think attributing all test failures, especially flakes, to TCM is also not the best way to go forward. 

I had a talk with [~bereng] as I would like to propose a different approach for the patch today or tomorrow.

With CASSANDRA-19026 there will no more async processing related to the previous test case overlapping the next test case. 

I also think that we should have a rule defined in CQLTester which puts a log line before / after each test case. Therefore we would not have to change the table names

I took that into account. But you still need to change table names if you compare logs from different envs like local vs circle. Also it's hard on the eyes when table_01 and table_10 are totally different things etc Even table_09 and table_09 can be totally different things if you have several tabs open and click on the wrong one and start comparing 2 completely different test classes logs by mistake. Don't ask me how I know...

[~blerer] do you think you'll have a gap to look into this so we can commit it?. Thx
