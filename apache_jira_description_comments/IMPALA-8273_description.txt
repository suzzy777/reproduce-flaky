CDH Hive has a configuration {{hive.metastore.notification.parameters.exclude.patterns}} which gives the ability to exclude certain parameter keys from notification events. This is mainly used as a safety valve in case there are huge values stored in these parameter maps. The template file should make sure that the parameter exclusion is disabled (or atleast configured such that it does not exclude {{impala.disableHmsSync}} which is needed by this feature.
