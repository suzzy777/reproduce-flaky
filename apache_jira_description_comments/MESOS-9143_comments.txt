commit 4380e5ba999b31782ef2fb32f51a1f225d28f5c5
Date:   Wed Feb 13 16:06:26 2019 -0800

Fixed a flaky test `MasterQuotaTest.RemoveSingleQuota`.

The test is flaky due to a race between metrics update
and metrics query.

This patch adds clock settle to ensure quota update and
removal are fully processed (including metrics updates) before
continuing with the metrics query.
