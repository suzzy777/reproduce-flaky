That job found core files. One of them is {{core.3251}} which matches the PID corresponding to the error message above. That likely means the test before test_very_verbose_logging is the real culprit. If the running host is still up, you can grab the core. If not, you can see the backtrace in the saved artifacts: there's a file that has them printed.

I logged in and it looked to me like the core was already gone.

I just got back to the office from a few weeks PTO and need to get caught up. I don't think I can look before next week. Can you re-assign?

Not sure why this is assigned to me. I am swamped with 20+ bugs on my plate now with one blocker. I won't get to it any time soon. Please reassign.

I haven't been able to reproduce this locally yet, but it looks like it may have happened again: http://sandbox.jenkins.cloudera.com/job/impala-cdh5-trunk-core/2048/ and I suspect that its the same issue as https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/IMPALA-2883
