the patch modifies only the doc. part, so the failures are not caused by the fix

Thanks for the patch [~kmarton]!

While you're at it, could you please remove all the other Tomcat references from {{AG_Install.twiki}}? Like the whole section *Setting Up Oozie with an Alternate Tomcat*. Thanks!

Hi [~andras.piros],

What if a user wants to use Oozie with Tomcat and not with the embedded Jetty? That *Setting Up Oozie with an Alternate Tomcat* part is related to this scenario, not? Which I think is still a valid one, not?

Thanks [~kmarton] for pointing this scenario out! I didn't think {{addtowar.sh}} still exists. +1

Committed to {{master}}.

Thank you, [~andras.piros] for the review and for committing it.  (addtowar.sh is kept: https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/distro/src/main/bin/addtowar.sh)

Closing issue; Oozie 5.0.0 is released.
