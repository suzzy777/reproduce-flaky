Git bisect points to CASSANDRA-13010 as the introducer of the test failure.

Its associated commit, [e7c9ac05f99cc8a5ee958169c49326e85ab4b25b|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/e7c9ac05f99cc8a5ee958169c49326e85ab4b25b], consistently breaks CI for the tests, as it can bee seen in [this repeated run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2008/workflows/2233dcbc-f0de-4888-b346-92a5bf1a0649].

Indeed, the pre-commit CI runs provided in CASSANDRA-13010 also hit the failure, [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/instaclustr/cassandra/1216/workflows/19d0beb7-310b-4170-8863-608bff7adb40] and [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/instaclustr/cassandra/1216/workflows/5ed6064f-f72d-4b44-bd0f-a47885e10de1].

The previous commit, [c4b1c0614e42b4ea2064822d31c28aa5d4f1450a|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/c4b1c0614e42b4ea2064822d31c28aa5d4f1450a], doesn't break CI, as it can bee seen in [this repeated run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2009/workflows/e32acbf3-05e2-4cdb-a60d-154aa4326f78].

Sorry for hijacking this as Brandon is assigned to this but I just found the reason why that whole test class behaves flaky. It is obvious from the PR. Very trivial fix.

No problem, I hadn't started yet, so thanks for the patch!  +1 assuming CI is happy.

both j8 and j11 precommit finished without any error
