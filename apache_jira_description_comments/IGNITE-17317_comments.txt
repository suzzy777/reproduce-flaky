The patch looks good to me

[~sergeychugunov], looks like resolved [commit|https://github.com/apache/ignite/commit/7aca244b68d81fa1f891d8f767be2a53b29438a3].  Please resolve the issue

[~tledkov], you're right, the issue is already fixed. I moved it to Resolved state. Thank you for spotting this!

[~sergeychugunov], are release notes really required for this issue? Please add notes or reset the flag.

[~tledkov], I reset both flags. The ticket is really minor, doesn't deserve to be mentioned in RNs or docs.
