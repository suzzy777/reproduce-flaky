hey [~jmslocum16], thanks for the offer of the PR.

I haven't put heaps of though into this, but on the surface it sounds like a good feature.  It would probably need to sit above the existing retry framework. How do you envisage configuring the number of times retries will occur etc. in the connection loss retry loop?

Hi [~cammckenzie],  thanks for the quick response!
I was also thinking it was probably too high-level for integrating with the retry framework, but too low-level for a recipe.
Based on reading some of the Curator code, my current thought was to integrate it at the framework level as an extra option. Something like Versionable on SetDataBuilder/DeleteBuilder or orSetData() on CreateBuilder, which already influence behavior on subsequent retries.

For example, adding a DataAndVersionable interface that works similarly to Versionable would work for SetDataBuilder/DeleteBuilder, and an Idempotent option to create.

Sounds good to me [~jmslocum16], if you would like to raise a PR I would be happy to review.

[~cammckenzie] I created an early version of the PR (only create requests, only foreground) to make sure my overall approach was on track before implementing the whole thing: https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/376
I'd appreciate any feedback you have, I'll continue working on the other parts.

Committed to master branch.

thank you [~jmslocum16]
