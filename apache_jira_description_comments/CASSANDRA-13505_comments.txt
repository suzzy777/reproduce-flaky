Hi Ariel,

I tried running this 20 times on a test box and they all passed. Looking at the history of the jobs there hasn't been any failures recently:

CassCI:
http://cassci.datastax.com/job/trunk_dtest/1575/testReport/user_functions_test/TestUserFunctions/test_migration/history/

Apache Jenkins: (These are the only 2 failures recently and they failed due to "Address already in use; a cluster may already be running or you may need to add the loopback alias". There were 800-1000 failures in each of the jobs so there may have been an infrastructure issue. 
https://builds.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk-dtest/142/testReport/user_functions_test/
https://builds.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk-dtest/143/testReport/user_functions_test/

I think we can close this, what do you think? 


I checked and it's listed as failed once in the last 26 builds in https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Cassandra/job/Cassandra-trunk-dtest-novnode/112/testReport/user_functions_test/TestUserFunctions/ but so are all the tests which kind of suggests you are right and it was just a bad build.

So let's close and re-open if necessary.
