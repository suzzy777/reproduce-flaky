See for example https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/7521/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli/TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver/testCliDriver_llap_acid_fast_/history/ (the history link is the same from any build number with a test run, just replace 7521 if this one expires).
Looks like results change, which may not be good.
