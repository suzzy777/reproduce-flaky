The test  "k-means|| initialization in KMeansSuite can fail when the random number generator is truly random.

The test is predicated on the assumption that each round of K-Means || will add at least one new cluster center.  The current implementation of K-Means || adds 2*k cluster centers with high probability.  However, there is no deterministic lower bound on the number of cluster centers added.

Choices are:

1)  change the KMeans || implementation to iterate on selecting points until it has satisfied a lower bound on the number of points chosen.

2) eliminate the test

3) ignore the problem and depend on the random number generator to sample the space in a lucky manner. 

Option (1) is most in keeping with the contract that KMeans || should provide a precise number of cluster centers when possible.
