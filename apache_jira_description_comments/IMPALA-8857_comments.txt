[~twmarshall], [~tarmstrong], we may release 3.3.0 soon. should we change the target version to 3.4.0?

[~twmarshall] If we haven't seen this recently, let's close it.

Encountered the issue recently in the following build:
https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-from-scratch/9713/

Not sure if it's relevant, but a similar test, test_kudu_col_changed failed due to network error here:
https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-from-scratch/9710/

IMPALA-8857: Fix flaky Kudu tests with external inserts

There are several Kudu related tests that are inherently flaky because
they insert rows into a Kudu table from the python Kudu client and
then scan the table from an Impala client even though no guarantees
are made about the consistency of operations from different clients.

This patch fixes this by adding a query option
'kudu_snapshot_read_timestamp_micros' which sets the timestamp at
which to perform Kudu snapshot reads.

The tests are then modified to set the timestamp to be equal to the
latest observed timestamp returned by the client that did the inserts
(plus 1 microsecond which the Kudu python client adds automatically
in latest_observed_timestamp() for this use case).
