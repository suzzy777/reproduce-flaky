[~fredyw] Mind taking a look? I'm guessing you might have some context here, by looking at the stack trace contents. I only saw this in one build.

[~fredyw], would you mind adding some context as to how & why this item got resolved? Thanks!

[~laszlog] the issue was caused by Sentry regression in CDH Impala, but Apache Impala isn't affected.
