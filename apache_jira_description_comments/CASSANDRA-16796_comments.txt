The 3.0/3.11 & 4.0/trunk patches are basically the same, so I've only kicked off ci-c jobs for 
[3.0|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/936] and [4.0|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/936]


Two questions...

1.) So just to make things explicit (for me, a non-gossip expert), notifying subscribers in {{onChange()}} means we hit {{updateNormalTokens()}}, which removes the endpoint from the "moving endpoints" set and eventually removes the pending ranges?

2.) What guarantees that a {{PendingRangeTask}} has run by the time {{gossipShutdownUpdatesTokenMetadata()}} verifies there are no longer pending range for node 2? 

The 3.0 patch looks good, so moving on to 4.0...



Thanks [~maedhroz]

bq. So just to make things explicit (for me, a non-gossip expert), notifying subscribers in onChange() means we hit updateNormalTokens(), which removes the endpoint from the "moving endpoints" set and eventually removes the pending ranges?

Yes, that's right. The shutting down node is essentially returning to a {{NORMAL}} state, so we just make sure that all
relevant parties (i.e. {{TokenMetadata}} ) are aware.

bq. What guarantees that a PendingRangeTask has run by the time gossipShutdownUpdatesTokenMetadata() verifies there are no longer pending range for node 2?

Good catch, I haven't seen any failures yet, but this definitely has the potential for flakiness. I've added a log
statement at {{DEBUG}} at the end of {{Gossiper::markAsShutdown}} to gate the test on, plus a blocking wait in the
assertion to ensure the PRT is complete before we check.

Circle runs are in the same place as before, new ASF CI jobs here: [3.0|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/961], [4.0|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/962]


+1 on all patches

Just watch out for the unused imports in {{GossipTest}} ;)

Thanks, cleaned up those unused imports and committed to 3.0 and merged to 3.11 -> 4.0 -> trunk.Â
