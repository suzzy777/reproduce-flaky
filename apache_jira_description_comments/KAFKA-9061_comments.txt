I think this has been fixed via KAFKA-7195 (since 2.0), I will close it for now.

Not sure it we can conclude it's been fixed since 2.0 when this ticket was opened only 4 months ago, so 2.4 I think?

That's a good point -- I only looked at the description / attachment and checked the source code and found it has been updated with KAFKA-7195, after checking the PR I thought it should be sufficient to fix the timeout cleanup issue, but then I checked the default timeout config value of admin client is also 120 secs, so throwing timeout exception indicates it has elapsed 120 secs in this case.

One thing that we can optimize is to batch the deletion of topics -- today we create one admin client, delete topic, and then destroy that client.

I have not seen this failure for a while, will close it for now. If we observe another failure we can re-create one.
