    [FLINK-8600] Don't use flaky truncate() test in BucketingSink
    
    The test was failing when using PrestoS3FileSystem because it doesn't
    use an absolute/qualified path. The test was questionable anyways
    because it tries writing to a random path that might not be writable by
    the user.
    
    This replaces the check with an explicit configuration setting for
    enabling/disabling truncate() support.

    (I realised this doesn't add any tests or anything but `BucketingSink` is currently problematic with S3 anyways.)

    @kl0u Thanks for the review!
    
    I changed the code to check `useTruncate` before calling. Regarding `fsConfig`, the settings in there are for `FileSystem` while the settings that are configured using a setter are for the behaviour of the `BucketingSink` itself. Does that make sense?

    @aljoscha Yes it does. I did not get it in the first place but I think that this clarifies things!

    @kl0u I changed my mind on this. ðŸ˜… Now the only change is to allow circumventing the `truncate()` checks via the setting. The checks themselves are still in place. I'm also not changing the call-sites to try and keep the change as localised as possible. WDYT?
