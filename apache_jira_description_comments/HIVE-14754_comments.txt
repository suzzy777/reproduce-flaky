+1 , glad to see new metrics!  just a question, what is the 1028 from (seems a bit arbitrary), and is it configurable?

It is completely random, isn't it? It is from the default size of the reservoir in Codahale:
http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/com.codahale.metrics/metrics-core/3.0.0/com/codahale/metrics/ExponentiallyDecayingReservoir.java

We use this reservoir, and have been using it before my patch, by default for every timer.

The value is configurable in Codahale but we didn't expose any property in hive for it. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to do so. I will raise a Jira for it.

Committed to master.  Thanks Barna for the contribution!

Doc note:  The new metrics need to be documented in the wiki.

* [Hive Metrics | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Metrics]

Added a TODOC2.2 label.

Wiki updated, thank you [~leftylev] for reminding me.

Thanks for the docs, [~zsombor.klara].  I removed the TODOC2.2 label.

Typo too late to fix:  hs2_suceeded_queries needs another "c":  hs2_succeeded_queries.  (Sorry I didn't notice earlier.)  Perhaps it can be fixed next time some metrics are added.

Sorry I did not catch the typo, yea we should fix it before the release if we can.

[~szehon], [~leftylev]
Yes, that typo was my bad. I created another Jira to track/fix it: HIVE-15864

Thanks for the fix, [~zsombor.klara].  I updated the wiki:
