No flakes since this was filed.

Running this test a bunch of times here: https://cassci.datastax.com/job/parameterized_dtest_multiplexer/162/

Looks like this fails ~1% of the time. It's only two nodes, do we want to bump up timeouts, or consider this might be a bug? [~mambocab]?

I think I'd rather have a dev have a look.
