There is a {{timeout}} parameter in some of the tests, can it still cause flakiness in the tests?

I think you mean testTimeoutTimingOutWriteLock.

No, I don't think it can cause problems: 
- L2 will time out for sure, because L1 holds the lock at that point (guaranteed)
- We call proceed(), L2 will continue terminating in the else branch
- We call awaitTermination() so we wait until L2 finishes

I was thinking - if the machine is very slow, 1000ms of timeout in testTimeoutWaitingWriteLock can be a problem.

If it takes too much time to execute
{code}
l1.proceed();
l1.awaitTermination();
{code}

then L2 might time out. I will increase the value to 10000 - that really should be enough. Same applies to testWriteLockSameThreadWait.
