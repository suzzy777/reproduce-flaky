Thanks for filing this. I've been seeing it often.

Adding another occurrence: https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka-pr/job/PR-13824/1/testReport/junit/org.apache.kafka.controller/QuorumControllerTest/Build___JDK_8_and_Scala_2_12___testBalancePartitionLeaders__/

I also encountered this here: 
https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka-pr/job/PR-13712/5/testReport/junit/org.apache.kafka.controller/QuorumControllerTest/Build___JDK_8_and_Scala_2_12___testBalancePartitionLeaders__/

[~jlprat] , [~cadonna] , thanks for linking these - after the originally suggested fix the failures seemed to disappear initially, but probably only became slightly more rare and can now be seen in the most recent `trunk` runs again: [https://ci-builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Kafka%2Fkafka/detail/trunk/1920/tests/]Â 

I'm trying to get a local repro (unfortunately still no luck with either Gradle or IntelliJ, but I'm still working through the full matrix of JDK and Scala versions). If nothing more elegant can be found or would work more reliably than the previous fix, bumping the session timeout with a second seemed reliable the last time, so it could be one possible alternative.

I'll update here once I have more to share.

Another instance here: https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka-pr/job/PR-13865/2/testReport/junit/org.apache.kafka.controller/QuorumControllerTest/Build___JDK_8_and_Scala_2_12___testBalancePartitionLeaders__/

After a good amount of not super-successful local attempts to reproduce this I have some evidence that the session timeout bump indeed addresses the issue. Although the testing doesn't seem very reliable as reproducing the issue isn't reliable to begin with, I've posted https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13908.

This test has been the top culprit for flakiness in the last month.

[~dimitarndimitrov] Thank you for attempting to fix this. Let me check your PR.

Moving it to 3.7.0 as we are near code freeze and it is not a blocker.
