It looks to me like the returned ExecSummary is wrong or invalid. Nothing very obvious in the logs (attached a snip that I believe is the relevant portion), and I found the profile that was written to the profile log (attached as well). I suspect something may be wrong with the profile because CM doesn't seem to decode it: when I loaded the encoded profile in the CM debug tool "impalaProfileDecoder" (e.g. http://cm-host:7180/cmf/debug/impalaProfileDecoder ), there was no profile details, and exporting as text resulted in a file that just said "Unknown profile.". A next step would be to try to decode the profile in some other way to check validity.
