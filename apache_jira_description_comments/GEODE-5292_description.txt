For a region that has been configured with off-heap storage and overflow to disk, memory can be leaked if

 * region clear
 * region destroyÂ 
 * region replace

all happen concurrently. The root cause appears to be region clear modifying entries for values stored on disk without synchronizing the entries. This prevents replace from freeing the off-heap memory for the new value when the replace fails because the region is being destroyed.
