After HDFS-6757, LeaseManager #removeLease became expensive. 
HDFS-6757 changed the {{sortedLeases}} object from TreeSet to PriorityQueue. 
Previously the {{remove(Object)}} operation from {{sortedLeases}} was {{O(log n)}} but after the change it became {{O( n)}} since it has to find the object first. 
Recently we had an incident in one of our production cluster just hours after we upgraded from 2.7 to 2.8 
The {{sortledLeases}} object had approximately 100,000 items within it. 
While removing the lease, it will acquire the LeaseManager lock and that will slow down the lookup of lease also.  

HDFS-6757 is a good improvement which replaced the path by inode id.
