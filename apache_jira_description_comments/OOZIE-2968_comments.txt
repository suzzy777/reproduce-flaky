I can't reproduce this test failure on my  machine :
{code}
gezapeti@rozi:~/oozie$ uname -a
Linux rozi 3.19.0-30-generic #34~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 2 22:09:39 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
{code}
Can you provide the Java version and the git hash you're experiencing the issue with?

$ uname -a
Linux pts00450-vm24 3.16.0-30-generic #40~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 15 17:42:36 UTC 2015 ppc64le ppc64le ppc64le GNU/Linux

$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_111"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-8u111-b14-3~14.04.1-b14)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.111-b14, mixed mode)


This issue is observed on ppc64le machine.

I ran into the same issue when running bin/mkdistro.sh Precommit builds also have the same problem: e.g. https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-OOZIE-Build/288/consoleFull

{code}
estJavaActionExecutor. testCredentialsSkip.

        at org.apache.oozie.action.hadoop.TestJavaActionExecutor.testCredentialsSkip(TestJavaActionExecutor.java:1006)
{code}

FYI: I moved this under OOZIE-3111

I think I have this figured out. The outcome of this test depends on the ordering of the test case inside {{TestJavaActionExecutor}}. If a certain testcase runs earlier, then it fails, because the {{providerCache}} inside {{CredentialsProviderFactory}} is not refreshed. Therefore we have to call {{CredentialsProviderFactory.destroy()}} before this test.

[~gezapeti] [~andras.piros] take a look please.
