Does it appear as only failed test? Is it possible it may be connected with some side effects from the other (possible failed/flaky) tests.

I think it's actually a flake, since it fails for different versions of python. Here's one with a failure on py36 and py37: https://github.com/apache/beam/runs/1179874513?check_suite_focus=true
Here's one on just py37: https://github.com/apache/beam/runs/1188087263?check_suite_focus=true
Here's one with no failures: https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/279654152

It seems likely its connected to some side effect from other tests, maybe its related to the text execution order, sometimes a zipimporter object is brought into the scope and gets pickled with a lambda?

I tested if zipimporter objects are picklable on my linux laptop, it failed on py2.7, and succeeded on py3.8.

zipimporter instances are not picklable on py3.7 or below. Confirmed this on my linux laptop and on a windows VM.

Notably the object that is getting pulled in from the main_session and failing to pickle is a zipimporter of the pytest.exe:

{code}
self = <dill._dill.Pickler object at 0x000002C7C5B72940>
obj = <zipimporter object "D:\a\beam\beam\sdks\python\target\.tox\py36-win\Scripts\pytest.exe">
save_persistent_id = True
{code}

pytest must only create this zipimporter object when running on Windows. I'm curious why it's flaky and not failing permanently. Maybe the object is no longer used and sometimes gets GC'd before we attempt to pickle it?

I tried forcing a GC before pickling the session and still saw flakes: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13096/checks?check_run_id=1250134859

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13099 should resolve the flakiness by skipping this test on windows. The action now is to fix and unskip the test, lowering priority.
