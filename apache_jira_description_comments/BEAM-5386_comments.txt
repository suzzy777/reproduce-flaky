[~chamikara] [~enchom] Thanks for reporting this. Have you done any more investigation, e.g. profiling?

As I mentioned on the mailing list, I'm eager to fix this bug but I couldn't find anything suspicious in {{UnboundedSourceWrapper}} so far.

Resolving this because the cause has been fixed via the linked pull request.

Thanks again for reporting this. Would be great to see if you gave this another try with the new release or the snapshot version.
