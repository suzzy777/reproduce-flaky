This visibility would also be a nice addition to org.apache.cassandra.db.virtual.StreamingVirtualTable; adding to the vtable as a list/set of failed peers can be easier than parsing logs.

In addition, it would be nice to enhance "org.apache.cassandra.streaming.StreamSession#closeSession" so failure also documents the "why" within the state rather than dumping only to the logs, this would make the information accessible via the vtable and the summary (rather than saying peer 42 failed, we can say why it failed)

[~bcicchi] I have made some updates to the logging of failed session in a stream. Currently, I'm cleaning up some test and looking for reviewers. An example of the a current log output is this:

WARN  [node2_Stream-Deserializer-/127.0.0.1:7012-969cebce] node2 2023-01-13 14:06:29,920 StreamResultFuture.java:248 - [Stream #62ebf140-9375-11ed-80a3-1fe3dc3967e8] Stream failed: 
Session peer /127.0.0.1:7012 Failed because there was an java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException with state=STREAMING

Any feedback?

Have 1 comment still not addressed, but mostly LGTM.  Will wait for [~djoshi] review

The new tests conflict with existing code, so fails to compile

Failing tests again, calling off merge

The author is on vacation and moving on, so i will finish this work.

test refactor shows that org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.streaming.StreamFailureLogsFailureDueToSessionTimeoutTest is likely the cause making things flakey.  I see that the test times out after a few minutes (should take 30s) and 

{code}
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: [node1 expected 1 element but was not true] 
Expected size:<1> but was:<0> in:
<[]>
	at org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.streaming.AbstractStreamFailureLogs.searchForLog(AbstractStreamFailureLogs.java:132)
	at org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.streaming.AbstractStreamFailureLogs.streamTimeoutTest(AbstractStreamFailureLogs.java:103)
	at org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.streaming.StreamFailureLogsFailureDueToSessionTimeoutTest.failureDueToSessionTimeout(StreamFailureLogsFailureDueToSessionTimeoutTest.java:30)
{code}

Merge was called off

not found the root cause yet but pushed logic that will not cause await to block forever (we now timeout after 1m)

https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra?branch=pr%2Fupstream_2104

My theory is that the JVM hangs due to this as we keep waiting for the trigger

FINALLY CLEAN BUILD!!!!!

This patch had my favorite flaky test of all time...

There is a test that force streaming to timeout (as it tests what happens on timeout), but the logic to detect a timeout was not getting triggered... because the stream timed out before the test could cause it to timeout... causing the test to hang/fail!

Changed the test to timeout if a timeout isn't detected within 1m and YOLO check if the stream timed out... this made the test stable!

Trippy...
