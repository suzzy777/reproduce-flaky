+1. Pending tests. Thanks for your contribution Ashish!

Not sure why the tests have not run for this. Should I re-attach the patch here for the tests to kick in?

Seems like there was an issue with test run: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-SENTRY-Build/1541/parameters/

Looks like that build is for SENTRY-1233 instead, https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-SENTRY-Build/1541/.

Ahh.. never mind, it is indeed for this JIRA, however note that there were no test errors, the failure seems to due to some network issue.

Actually there are some test failures although they do not seem related: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-SENTRY-Build/1541/artifact/test-output/test.txt

Ahh.. hard to browse through. However I have run the kafka tests, which are the only relevant tests for these changes, and they work fine.

So there seems to be two issues: 
- Precommit is red since yesterday as it is failing to comment on the issue with the test results. And this seems like is due to the current ongoing security measure to block any one outside of contributor/committer/PMC role to comment/create jiras. I just added hadoopqa as a contributor and kicked off another build.
- The test failure discussed above seems flaky and unrelated to this patch. So hopefully it should pass this time. Will open another jira to track flakyness if it fails again.
