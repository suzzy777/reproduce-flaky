Ping [~meiyi]

The code of CleanerChore in branch-2 is different from master:
{code:java}
branch-2:
boolean deleted = allFilesDeleted && allSubDirsDeleted;

master:
boolean deleted = allFilesDeleted && allSubDirsDeleted && isEmptyDirDeletable(dir);
{code}
Let me fix it.

 

Merged pull request to branch-2.
