Flaky tests should be fixed. They were earlier disabled for Travis, but have further been disabled for better distribution release experience.

The list so far is (class names):Â 
 * GobblinClusterKillTest
 * PasswordManagerTest
 * DecryptConverterTest
 * TextFileBasedSourceTest
 * TestTunnelWithArbitraryTCPTraffic
 * TunnelTest
 * GobblinYarnAppLauncherTest
 * GPGFileDecryptorTest
 * Kafka09TopicProvisionTest
 * TestStressTestingSource
 * AzkabanAjaxAPIClientTest
 * FSJobCatalogHelperTest
 * JobConfigFileMonitorTest
 * AsyncWriterManagerTest

Note: This list has been further expanded based on the tests that demonstrated flaky behavior and failed.
