I installed zeppelin v7.0 on a centos6.5 based image, which made an new image.
I started the new image with CMD  +_${ZEPPELIN_HOME}/bin/zeppelin.sh --config ${ZEPPELIN_CONF_DIR} _+ . It stared and work normally until I run an shell script.
An script as simple as 'ls'. It failed and the log said that working directory '.' can not be
found.
I add a line of code to set current working directory to USER`s home, and it works.
