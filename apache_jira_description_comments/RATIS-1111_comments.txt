do you mind me working on this task? I am interested in how does streaming api work from an application perspective.

How about RATIS-1084?  Are you working on it?

[~szetszwo] maybe now is right time that we start to pick up this JIRA?

Let's finish up RATIS-1130.  The change here is more complicated than RATIS-1130.

[~amaliujia], assigning this to you.  Thanks.

[~amaliujia] Hi, sorry for disturb. What's the progress of this jira ? Do you need any help ? Maybe we can create some tasks and work together to get the performance result, and push ratis streaming forward quickly.

thanks [~yjxxtd]

 

I was a bit busy last week on other things and so still working on a local prototype on this JIRA. How about let me figure out whether we can have sub tasks for this Jira during this process. If there are any work can be done in parallel, I will create sub tasks and let you know.

[~amaliujia] Thanks. Let's push ratis streaming quickly together.

[~amaliujia], it is indeed a good time to work on FileStore.  After RATIS-1171, we are pretty confident that the basic Streaming feature is working.

[~yjxxtd], Streaming probably is not working when there is a leader change.  We need to test it and think about how to make it work.

[~szetszwo] Thanks for reminding. I will test leader change case.

I think a better approach is to have a minimal working version for streaming filestore, then identify in parallel work so anyone can work on it.

 

I have created a WIP: [https://github.com/apache/incubator-ratis/pull/298.] I am happy to hear your feedback to know what a minimal working version should be.

[~amaliujia], just have filed RATIS-1186.  See if you also want to work on it.

[~szetszwo] [~amaliujia] I can work on RATIS-1186.

[~yjxxtd], that's great.  Thanks a lot!

I just have merged the pull request.  Thanks, [~amaliujia]!

Thanks also [~yjxxtd] for reviewing this.
