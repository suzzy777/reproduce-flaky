Here are some examples of the CI runs generated by different combinations of flags:

* [{{./circleci/generate.sh -p}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra?branch=17113-trunk-p]
* [{{./circleci/generate.sh -pr}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra?branch=17113-trunk-pr]
* [{{./circleci/generate.sh -s}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra?branch=17113-trunk-s]
* [{{./circleci/generate.sh -sr}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra?branch=17113-trunk-sr]
* [{{./circleci/generate.sh -sp}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra?branch=17113-trunk-sp]

bq. The new -p flag generates only the pre-commit workflows, whereas the -s flag generates only the workflows with separate approval steps for each test job.
Does this still generate a separate "jdk11_jdk11, [jdk8_jdk8, jdk8_jdk11]" pair of workflows, or does this also combine together all the pre-commit required jobs into one workflow to be run from a top level approval? (edit: the linked circle pipelines don't seem to have workflows in them so I can't infer from there)
