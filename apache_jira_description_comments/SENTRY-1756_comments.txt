[~akolb] are you working on this? If not, can I take it?

[~spena] I have not started working on it yet, so feel free to grab it.

I think the easiest way to deal with it is to have a simple mode of HMSFollower that is used on the passive side that just gets the latest processed ID and updates its listeners.

I run these tests locally and they're passing. [~akolb] Do you know if these tests are flaky?

[~spena] I suspect it is caused by issue in SENTRY-1731. I have updated the issue with error message in build 2671. The fix is mentioned by Sasha, and it will be big code change.
