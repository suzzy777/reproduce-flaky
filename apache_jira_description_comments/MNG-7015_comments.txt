I had a quick look at the branches you named. It looks to me the test somehow became flaky. The first attempt failed with failure to resolve maven-resources-plugin:3.2.0, but the second attempt succeeded (all test cases passed).

Did you start with an empty local repo? I can always reproduce the issue.

I also took a look and got the same result. When starting out with an empty .m2 repository (I use a dedicated one for integration tests anyway) it is quite easy to reproduce.
Actually, in my last attempt even the Bootstrap test failed because of similar issues. Did anything change regarding dependency downloading/resolving which could cause this?

I added both the log of bootstrap and a log of the +first+ mvn invocation of the failing test (background below), the one withÂ -Dmodule-a.fail=true.

Bit of background on why the test fails. "MavenITmng5760ResumeFeatureTest#testShouldSkipSuccessfulModulesWhenTheFirstModuleFailed" fails because in the first invocation both module-a and module-b fail, while the test only expects module-a to fail. Re-triggering the invocation with --resume will then result in building both a and b, instead of only a.

Unfortunately I don't have any time left the coming days to look further into this. I hope this helps.

Fixed with [fcdeba0d322b24d00ea1940fd0f6e714aea17c71|https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=maven-integration-testing.git;a=commit;h=fcdeba0d322b24d00ea1940fd0f6e714aea17c71].
