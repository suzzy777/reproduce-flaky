Here's a trivial patch that makes failonerror configurable for the top-level "test" task.

This works for the use case above but depending on what you want to happen, you need to understand the ant structure a bit.  For example:
1) If the test task fails, no test report will be generated.  So you may have to specify -Dtests.ifNoTests=ignore as well or the task will still fail.  If all the lucene tests pass and the solr tests fail (or visa versa), the task will succeed even without specifying -Dtests.ifNoTests=ignore because the passing subdir will generate the report.
2) This setting affects the entire task, so calling "ant test" can pass even if say, compilation is broken.  You may want to specify something like "ant compile compile-test test" or similar to avoid this.
