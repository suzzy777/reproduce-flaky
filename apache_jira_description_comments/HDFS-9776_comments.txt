The link is not available anymore. The lira was filed several years ago; therefore, I am not sure we can rely on the same assessment.

In the attached log, I see :

{code:bash}
2020-10-22 20:46:05,889 [IPC Server handler 0 on default port 44039] INFO  blockmanagement.BlockPlacementPolicy (BlockPlacementPolicyDefault.java:chooseRandom(897)) - Not enough replicas was chosen. Reason: {NODE_TOO_BUSY=1}
{code}

Perhaps the unit test cane less flaky if we add 


{code:java}
conf.setBoolean(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_REDUNDANCY_CONSIDERLOAD_KEY, false);
{code}



Committed to trunk, branch-3.3, branch-3.2, and branch-3.1. Thanks [~ahussein] for your contribution.

cherry-pick to branch-3.2.2 and verify at local, Thanks [~ahussein].
