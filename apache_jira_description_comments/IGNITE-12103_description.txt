While testing 2.7.6-RC1 it came up that we no longer write data to /tmp/ignite/work, which is good, but now we would instead write to /home/username/work, which is bad. ~/work is a generic directory not linked to Ignite in any obvious way, and users will be puzzled by its appearance with possibilities of data loss or, even worse, their own documents loss if they happen to have something in Work dir and it gets clobbered/removed by accident.

I suggest changing this default once more, to use either /home/username/ignite/{work,logs,etc} or ./ignite/{work,logs,etc} by leveraging user.dir property pointing to current working dir.

Please note that user.dir has its own problems since it is supposed to not be changeable after JVM is up, but some code still tries to change it.
