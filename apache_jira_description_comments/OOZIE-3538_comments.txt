Thanks [~nobigo] for the fix. According to the documentation you linked, true is the default value, so we might just delete the whole line.

If we really want to avoid parallel tests (as the comment indicate) then false should be a more logical choice if I understand this parameter correctly. Could you test it with false? Does it work? Is it slower?

[~nobigo] According to the history of this jira, you have uploaded a new version, but I cannot find it in the attachments. Can you please check it and upload it again if necessary.

[~asalamon74], I have delete it, Because have some problem.Then I want to confirm one thing with you . I have  run to “mvn  clean test" in local right ? Because I run this order in oozie-master can't success. It failed shows "Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.22.2:test *(default-test)* on project oozie-core: *There was a timeout or other error in the fork" in module oozie-core.* Then I run "bin/test-patch --patch=../OOZIE-****-001.patch --reset-scm --tasks=TESTS"  have error I will check that.

Yes, the Oozie tests are quite slow so it timeouts in the core module. Check the maven settings here ( [https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/bin/test-patch-20-tests] ) it should work with that.

[~asalamon74],Hi. I am sorry for can't test this patch in local.So I upload the patch want to test by [~hadoopqa].

[~asalamon74]. Hi. After [~hadoopqa] the test. Just modify this value to false,Then this work is very slow. So I just change 1 to true.
