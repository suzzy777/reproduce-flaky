    [BEAM-2318] Ensure that tables that don't exist are not created

    We use the same test table name in two tests: one that expects the table not to exist, another that
    creates the table. Obviously, the correctness of this will depend on the order in which unit tests
    are executed.
    
    Fix the flake by using different and more explicit test names.
