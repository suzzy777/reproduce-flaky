I think execution time check only once is better.

    It makes sense displaying last execution time instead of creation time of the notebook in the job page. 
    
    Tested and works well LGTM.
    
    Let's merge it to master and branch-0.7 if no more discussion.

    @byung-u I missed the CI status/
    
    Could you make sure CI is green?

    Thank you for your review.
    
    I've tried to make CI green, but still fails though.
    It looks like r-base-dev package install fail.

    It's weird. https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2541 passed CI and we modified https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/.travis.yml 21 days ago.
    
    I guess 
    
    - the package was not available at that time
    - or ...
    
    Could you trigger CI again? `git commit --amend` and `git push --force` would be enough.

    Some PRs made yesterday passed CI. Could you rebase using current master? I am not sure what base branch you are using.

    I think now CI works properly.
    
    Please restart the failed test since it looks like the flaky test

    @byung-u 
    Oh, I didn't see the code and commented above...üòÖ 
    But I found you missed something!
    
    The original code has an error because it always gets `lastRunningUnixTime` from the last paragraph.
    So, you can fix it by switching the code below
    ```java
    lastRunningUnixTime = getUnixTimeLastRunParagraph(paragraph);		
    ```
    to
    ```java
    lastRunningUnixTime = Math.max(getUnixTimeLastRunParagraph(paragraph), lastRunningUnixTime);
    ```
    Then, `lastRunningUnixTime` will be the latest running time among the paragraphs.
    
    It will be appreciated if you address it!
    Thanks :)

    @tae-jun Thank you for your comment.
    I'm gonna fix & test again.
    
    My code use only 1st paragraph for every note, 
    because of this logic inside double for loop.
    If I have 1,000 notes and 1,000 paragraphs for every note, 
    then `lastRunningUnixTime = getUnixTimeLastRunParagraph(paragraph);` is calling 1,000,000 times.
    ```
        for (Note note : notes) {
          ...
          for (Paragraph paragraph : note.getParagraphs()) {
            ...
            lastRunningUnixTime = getUnixTimeLastRunParagraph(paragraph);
           
          }
       }
    ```
