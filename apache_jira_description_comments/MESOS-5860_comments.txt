We would generate two {{StatusUpdateAcknowledgementMessage}} which target is {{slave.get()->pid}}. So  {{AWAIT_READY(acknowledgement);}} may satisfy when master send first {{StatusUpdateAcknowledgementMessage}}.

Still trying to reproduce this in my env.

Could not reproduce after 10000 interactions in my slow ubuntu vm and my powerful server. I prefer to hold this on to see if have more cases. 

Can reproduce with {{stress --cpu 4 --timeout 3600s}} after 3000 interactions.

After apply the patch, could not reproduce with {{stress --cpu 4 --timeout 3600s}}

    Fixed the flaky test case `MasterAPITest.GetTasks`.
    
    This changes to wait for every `StatusUpdateAcknowledgementMessage`
    exactly in this test case to make sure they don't conflict each other.
