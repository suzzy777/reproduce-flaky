Further to the fix I also updated the docs.

CI has only known failures where ticket exists.

Running last CI:

[4.1|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1686/workflows/0fd9eb9f-3074-4b21-8ba2-d8c8b83613b8]

I have good news and bad news. There are no new failures, but there is one that is not in Butler, no ticket but I can reproduce it in 4.1 so I will have to add one more flaky test ticket :(
