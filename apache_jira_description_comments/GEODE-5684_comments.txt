GEODE-5684: refactor callAndValidate

* rename flag from outcomeSet to expectedResultIsSet
* refactor callAndValidate to use try/catch blocks for checking expected
results and exceptions and throwing up assertion errors to the error
collector, for the purpose of readability and reducing repetition.
