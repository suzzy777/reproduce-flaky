[~dongjoon], btw, why is this flaky test a release blocker?

This bug is not reported correctly as we see https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-2.7/5809/ . Jenkins fails with the test report `no failures`. We need to see the actual log.

- Accessing TorrentBroadcast variables in a local cluster (encryption = off) *** FAILED ***

I haven't seen this one in a while, FWIW.

I encountered this issue on latest master branch and see that its the race between *org.apache.spark.deploy.DeployMessages.WorkDirCleanup* event and  *org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker#onStop*. Here its possible that while the WorkDirCleanup event is being processed, *org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker#cleanupThreadExecutor* was shutdown. hence any submission after ThreadPoolExecutor will result in *java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException*

Attaching the debug snapshot of same. I would like to work on this. Please suggest

[~ajithshetty] does your PR fix the flaky test? If I read correctly, the failure is because of OOM. RejectedExecutionException is just side effect because OOM triggers an unexpected executor shut down. Should we try to figure out why OOM happens? Maybe we have some memory leak.
