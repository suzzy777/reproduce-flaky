Assertion was added as part IGNITE-8657 into GridDhtPartitionsExchangeFuture which is correct only in situation when client has to reconnect due to too short EXCHANGE_HISTORY.

Exceptions from other situations like not being able to acquire file lock are also passed to client node in FullMessage.

This assertion should be removed and check should be introduced instead: if this exception is intended to be thrown on current client node, we should do this, otherwise old program flow should be executed.
