    @astroshim: why? does that mean I also need to do https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2099 based on branch-0.7 ?

    @Remilito yeah you're right. Normally if the PR is for bug fixing or minor update, committers merge it both into master and branch-0.x. But since #2099 was merged into master only, you don't need to.

    thanks for the clarification @AhyoungRyu
