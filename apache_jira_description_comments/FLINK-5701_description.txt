The problem:

The producer holds a {{pendingRecords}} value that is incremented on each invoke() and decremented on each callback, used to check if the producer needs to sync on pending callbacks on checkpoints.
On each checkpoint, we should only consider the checkpoint succeeded iff after flushing the {{pendingRecords == 0}} and {{asyncException == null}} (currently, weâ€™re only checking {{pendingRecords}}).

A quick fix for this is to check and rethrow async exceptions in the {{snapshotState}} method both before and after flushing and {{pendingRecords}} becomes 0.
