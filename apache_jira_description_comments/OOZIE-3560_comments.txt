Great idea to fix the old {{index.jsp}} [~nobigo]. I think we should check the generated HTML using a validator ( e.g. [https://validator.w3.org/] ) and fix all the errors. I've checked it and it seems to me it lists a few errors (not only the three found by IDEA) and several warnings. We should eliminate all the errors, if possible that then also the warnings.

[~nobigo], did you had any change to check the generated HTML?
