Can you attach a minimum project with necessary sources in a zip file?

Alternatively, use your XML report, write a unit test passing that XML report to the {{SurefireReportParser}} and build the test on expected assertions statements. Call the method {{SurefireReportParser.parseXMLReportFiles()}} and you should see the same result in the chart.

Thanks [~tibordigana]  for the response. I have attached Test.zip with the ticket. Can you check if that helps?

The command I used to run the tests was
{code:java}
 mvn surefire-report:report -Dsurefire.rerunFailingTestsCount=2 -Dtest=Flakes,Pass{code}
 

 

 

Why you used {{surefire-report-parser}} in you POM?
I meant a contribution on Github ;-) So i can guide you through the fix in our code.

 I forgot to take out surefire-report-parse from the pom before sending it you.

And sorry. I misunderstood.This is my first time creating a ticket with third party. I added the code to github like below. Is that what you were looking for?

Thank you for the link.
I meant something else. Normally we want the users to make the fix. So therefore I asked you whether you wanted to help us making the fix.
The developers open a pullrequest on https://github.com/apache/maven-surefire and the fix is usually discussed and reviewed.
No worries if you are not convinced about the fix. We will help you with the work.
I am almost totally convinced that the bug is in [TestSuiteXmlParser|https://github.com/apache/maven-surefire/blob/master/surefire-report-parser/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/plugins/surefire/report/TestSuiteXmlParser.java]
It would be fine for you to write a new test method in [TestSuiteXmlParserTest|https://github.com/apache/maven-surefire/blob/master/surefire-report-parser/src/test/java/org/apache/maven/plugins/surefire/report/TestSuiteXmlParserTest.java] and you can add you XML report in {{src/test/resources}} - just see the test method *successfulSurefireTestReport*.
Your test will prove the bug is in [here|https://github.com/apache/maven-surefire/blob/master/surefire-report-parser/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/plugins/surefire/report/TestSuiteXmlParser.java#L122] because the result of the testcase cannot be determined by parsing case by case in the switch. It should real all cases and then the result should go to a missing logic which specifically looks for flakes. This logic does not exist and this should be the fix.

Thanks [~tibordigana]. I tried creating a test method in the class like below and ran the test with [^TEST-com.test.Flakes.xml] . The test passed (showed correct number of tests, failures, flakes etc)
{code:java}
@Test
public void successfulSurefireTestReportWithFlakes() throws Exception {
    TestSuiteXmlParser parser = new TestSuiteXmlParser( consoleLogger );
    File surefireReport = new File( "src/test/resources/junit-pathWithÜmlaut/TEST-com.test.Flakes.xml" );
    assumeTrue( surefireReport.isFile() );
    Collection<ReportTestSuite> suites = parser.parse( surefireReport.getCanonicalPath() );
    assertNotNull( suites );
    assertEquals( 1, suites.size() );
    ReportTestSuite suite = suites.iterator().next();

    assertThat( suite.getNumberOfTests(), is( 1 ) );
    assertEquals( 1, suite.getNumberOfTests() );
    assertEquals( 1, suite.getNumberOfFlakes() );
    assertEquals( 0, suite.getNumberOfFailures() );
    assertEquals( 0, suite.getNumberOfErrors() );
    assertEquals( 0, suite.getNumberOfSkipped() );
    assertThat( suite.getFullClassName(), is( "com.test.Flakes" ) );
    assertThat( suite.getPackageName(), is( "com.test" ) );
    assertThat( suite.getName(), is( "Flakes" ) );
    ReportTestCase test = suite.getTestCases().iterator().next();
    assertTrue( test.isSuccessful() );
    assertNull( test.getFailureDetail() );
    assertNull( test.getFailureErrorLine() );
    assertNull( test.getFailureType() );
    assertThat( test.getFullClassName(), is( "com.test.Flakes" ) );
    assertThat( test.getClassName(), is( "Flakes" ) );
    assertThat( test.getName(), is( "run" ) );
    assertThat( test.getFullName(), is( "com.test.Flakes.run" ) );
} {code}
I am new to the github world, so I am not sure how to commit this test to the repository.

 

can you please help on how to proceed?

In your real test you have got:
Errors: 1, Failures: 7
Where these numbers come from? They should be zeros and they were the post results of flakes?
So the XML provided looks too simple to break this test with TestSuiteXmlParser. The XML should be more realistic in order to provocate the bug as we can see it in the HTML report.

I was out sick for two weeks. Will try this again today and keep you posted.
