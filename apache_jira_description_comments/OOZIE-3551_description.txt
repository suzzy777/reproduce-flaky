Task:
Add the following to the spark opts section of the spark action 
--conf spark.yarn.security.tokens.hiveserver2.enabled=false --conf spark.yarn.security.tokens.hivestreaming.enabled=false

Issue:
If Spark is launched form Oozie then we need to turn these 2 and some others off: [http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-yarn.html#launching-your-application-with-apache-oozie] and let Oozie obtain the tokens.
