stanislavkozlovski opened a new pull request #5485: KAFKA-7266: Fix MetricsTest.testMetrics flakiness by increasing batch…
URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/5485
 
 
   The test `kafka.api.MetricsTest.testMetrics` has been failing intermittently in kafka builds.
   The particular failure is in the `MessageConversionsTimeMs` metric assertion:
   ```
   java.lang.AssertionError: Message conversion time not recorded 0.0
   ```
   
   The test would intermittently fail because the conversion time took less than 1 millisecond. Such conversion time is reported as zero by the metric.
   There has been work done previously (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/4681) to combat the flakiness of the test and while it has improved it, the test still fails sometimes.
   
   Locally, this test failed 5 times out of 25. Increasing batch size to 8MB caused it to fail 1 out of 100 times.
   
   ### Changes
   Increase the batch size from 1MB to 16MB to ensure it takes more than 1 millisecond for conversion

Hey [~lindong], is there any reason this can't go into `2.1.0`? It is in `trunk` since Aug 13 and the `2.1.0` branch isn't cut yet, so I assume it'll be cut from `trunk` and actually go into `2.1.0` by default?

[~enether], the JIRA was not marked as fixed, that's why. I did it now.

Thanks. Sorry for not marking it the first time around
