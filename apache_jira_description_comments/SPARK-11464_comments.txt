Hi [~kayousterhout]  - I am on 1.6.0-SNAPSHOT Spark and cannot reproduce this on local, tried multiple times. Also checked previous multiple builds on https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder, even the failed ones do not see this coming up.

There can be possibly tuning once it can be reproduced on advanceTimeWithRealDelay(ssc, firstNumBatches) (ln:92) call. What do you suggest? thanks!

I'm going to close this -- I saw it on Jenkins a while ago (not locally) but if it hasn't happened recently, it seems likely to have been a transient issue.
