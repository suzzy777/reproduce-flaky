This test is flaky and can fail with the following error:
{noformat}
../../src/tests/storage_local_resource_provider_tests.cpp:3167
Failed to wait 15secs for pluginRestarted{noformat}
The actual error is the following:
{noformat}
E0802 22:13:37.265038  8216 provider.cpp:1496] Failed to reconcile resource provider b9379982-d990-4f63-8a5b-10edd4f5a1bb: Collect failed: OS Error{noformat}
The root cause is that the SLRP calls {{ListVolumes}} and {{GetCapacity}} when starting up, and if the plugin container is killed when these calls are ongoing, gRPC will return an {{OS Error}} which will lead the SLRP to fail.

This flakiness will be fixed once we finish https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-8400.
