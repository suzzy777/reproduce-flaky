[~elgoiri] Do you have any cycles to take a look at this request?

The PR is fighting many flaky tests.  Not sure how many times you want me to run this to get them to pass.

Yes, those test are clearly flaky,
I'm fine with merging it.
Approved there.

Merged PR 2633.
Thanks [~belugabehr] for the contribution.

ok, there's a story here. The interface was protected and we didn't know which external subclasses, if any, were using it. 

This is why the comment above the line you've just changed says

{code}
 /**
   * This log is widely used in the org.apache.hadoop.fs code and tests,
   * so must be considered something to only be changed with care.
   */ 
{code}

I see you've discovered most of the issues there. There's one more: a risk of external use. Can you add it to the release notes


Agree with [~stevel@apache.org] mentioned above. The Jira is open but PR has been merged.

The merged change breaks the Hadoop CI/Jenkins as now the ambiguity issue between two slf4j Logger instances to the same FileSystem.class failed the build. 

Previously log instances seem hacky with as one from common logger and one from slf4j.

I opened HADOOP-17581 to unblock CI by changing the affected tests not using FileSystem.LOG directly. 

Any plans backporting this?

probably time to backport; if things break, well, its time to update the log
