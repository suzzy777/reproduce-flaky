Running parameterized tests with the junit-platform provider causes tests to be counted as single test (unlike using junit4 provider). This makes the tests to be marked as 'Flaky' and marks the build as successful if the retry failed count is greater than zero. Reports also show a single test run even if there were multiple tests with different parameters.

For a sample project with the problem see [surefire-flaky-issue|https://github.com/chalmagr/surefire-flaky-report]Â 

This is also a possibly related to issue SUREFIRE-2010 and may help in the resolution of it.
