URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6441
 
 
   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8098
   
   The flaky failure is caused by the fact that the main thread sometimes issues DescribeConsumerGroup request before the consumer thread starts. Added a latch to make sure such situation is not going to happen.

In the test, we first test removing 1 member from group, and then test removing the other 2 members from group, and it failed sometimes at the 2nd member number assert. After investigation, I found it's because we enabled auto commit for the consumers(default setting), and the removed consumer offset commit will get the {{UNKNOWN_MEMBER_ID}} error, which will then make the member rejoin. (check ConsumerCoordinator#OffsetCommitResponseHandler) So, that's why after the 2nd members removing, the members will sometimes be not empty.

I set the consumer config to disable the auto commit to fix this issue. Thanks.
