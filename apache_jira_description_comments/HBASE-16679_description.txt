Minor perf change:
Calculate maxThroughputPerOperation outside of control() since start()&end() are called only once per operation, but control can be called hundreds/thousands of time.

Flaky test:
Problems in current test:
- writes only  2.5MB each iteration but control triggers sleep only every 1Mb write (decided by HBASE_HSTORE_FLUSH_THROUGHPUT_CONTROL_CHECK_INTERVAL). Either increase data written in each batch or decreasing this threshold for better throughput control.

- We shouldn't be timing table disable/delete/create and populating data in throughput calculations.
