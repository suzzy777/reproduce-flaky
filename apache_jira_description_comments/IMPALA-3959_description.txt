Even though data loading jobs run BE, FE, and core EE tests, the logs for these tests are not saved. (The only artifacts saved are those used by snapshot consumers: the snapshot, metastore snapshot, and git hash). This is a problem when there are flaky tests that fail there that we haven't seen fail elsewhere: we have no forensic evidence to search through for clues.

Example:

http://sandbox.jenkins.cloudera.com/job/impala-asf-master-core-data-load/29/

{noformat}
22:55:09 99% tests passed, 1 tests failed out of 78
22:55:09 
22:55:09 The following tests FAILED:
22:55:09 	 13 - kudu-scan-node-test (OTHER_FAULT)
22:55:09 Errors while running CTest
22:55:09 make: *** [test] Error 8
{noformat}

This kudu scan node test failed, but we have no other info on it, because we have no artifacts.

Part of the problem is that the data load job has a separate entry point, so everything built up in {{Impala-aux/jenkins/build.sh}} to handle archiving doesn't exist for {{Impala-aux/jenkins/build-data-load.sh}}.
