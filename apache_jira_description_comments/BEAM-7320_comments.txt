Is this just a flaky test? I saw it fail on Java PreCommit with DirectRunner in the same way: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Commit/15493/testReport/junit/org.apache.beam.sdk.io/TextIOWriteTest/testWriteViaSink/

{code}
java.lang.AssertionError: Read Files/Read all via FileBasedSource/Read ranges/ParMultiDo(ReadFileRanges).output: 
Expected: iterable with items ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"] in any order
     but: not matched: "b"

Yes this is just flaky, saw it fail on DirectRunner again: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Cron/3997/testReport/junit/org.apache.beam.sdk.io/TextIOWriteTest/testWriteViaSink/

It looks like this test is running two separate pipelines that write and read the data simultaneously. It seems likely the flake is just a race between these two.

Looks like this happened a few times in the past week:
- https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Cron/3969/ (04/28)
- https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Cron/3975/ (04/29)

I'll set a reminder for myself to check on this in a couple of weeks, and re-open if we see it again.

Just checked and it looks like there haven't been any flakes since https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14740 was merged
