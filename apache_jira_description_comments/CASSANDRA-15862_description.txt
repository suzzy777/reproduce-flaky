Language matters. I'd like to remove all references in Apache Airflow to whitelist or black list, and the Cassandra Python API has some that we can't easily remove.

The recent global events have made this even more relevant, but this has been on my radar for a while now. Here is a well written article for why I think it matters

My exposure to is via the Python API where there is the cassandra.pollicies.WhiteListRoundRobinPolicy class. I propose that this be renamed to AllowListRoundRobinPolicy instead. I do not know if there are other references.
