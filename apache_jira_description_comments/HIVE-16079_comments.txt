Heads up. Currently we are not enforcing jdk8 as minimum required version. Using BiConsumer might fail builds on jdk7. There is some discussion to move hive to jdk8 as minimum required version but until then this will keep breaking jdk7 builds. Travis will show failures as it builds on both jdk7 and 8. 

Thank you for paying attention, [~prasanth_j] Actually, the new class is currently written such that _no_ Hashtable methods that were added in JDK 8 (indeed some of them use BiConsumer) are overridden in it. However, I added comments that include headers of these methods, so that they are more visible. Once Hive moves to JDK 8 (and there is no JDK 7 compatibility requirement), these methods should be properly implemented. But for now, the code compiles for me with the standard mvn command that, as far as I know, enforces JDK 7 compatibility.

I've just created an RB: https://reviews.apache.org/r/57353/ I will appreciate your comments (this has been in waiting for almost a week by this time).

Now that we have moved to jdk8 this patch can be simplified quite a bit. [~misha@cloudera.com] Would you like to update your patch?

Hi [~ashutoshc], sorry for a delay with response - I've been on vacation.

When you say that Hive moved to JDK8, do you mean that there is no JDK7 compatibility requirement anymore? That is, one can, for example, use the new Streaming APIs in the Hive code? If so, then indeed, my patch can be simplified substantially. Please let me know.

yes.. no jdk7 compatibility requirement, so you may use jdk8 specific apis.

Attached the second version of the patch, with all JDK8 methods in CopyOnFirstWriteProperties.java overridden properly.

It looks like testCliDriver[vector_if_expr] test is broken - it fails in every build.

[~misha@cloudera.com] I left a couple of comments on the RB.

Uploaded the 3rd patch, that addresses Sergio's comments.

The patch looks good [~misha@cloudera.com]
+1

I'll wait for the tests before commit it.

vector_if_expr test fails in pretty much every Hive build. accumulo_index fails in every 2nd..3rd build, so it looks flaky as well.

Agree. Those tests are flaky.

Thanks [~misha@cloudera.com] for your contribution. I committed this to master. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I won't commit it to branch-2 due to JDK8 exclusive changes.

Thank you [~spena]. Yes, this patch contains changes that are not backward compatible with JDK versions earlier than 8. So I guess it can only be committed to master.

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
