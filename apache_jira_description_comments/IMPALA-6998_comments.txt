It probably doesn't make sense running this against all filesystems. [~joemcdonnell], is there some umbrella JIRA that tracks what tests to run against what filesystems? If yes, I can link this there, else I'll create one for it.

[~sailesh],

If it's flaky in the meanwhile, I think you can mark it with {{@SkipIfNotHdfsMinicluster.plans}} or {{@SkipIfIsilon}} with no harm.

IMPALA-6998: test_bloom_wait_time fails due to late arrival of filters on Isilon

This test has been failing on Isilon runs, most likely due to timing issues
which makes it a test issue rather than a product bug.

This patch disables the test for Isilon. We should revisit what tests we run
on non-HDFS filesystems later on, but until then, this should unblock
the build.
