Same as SPARK-5227?

I have tried to repo this in a number of different ways and failed:

1. On mac with sbt and without sbt.
2. On centos 6x using sbt and without sbt
3. On ubuntu using sbt and without sbt

Yet it is reproducible on the build machines but only for hadoop 2.2. As [~joshrosen] pointed out, it might be some shared state that is specific to older versions of hadoop. How do we feel about changing this test suite so that it doesn't use a shared spark context. I know it will slow down the test a bit but might be the easiest way.
