From the attached log, I can see agent has received the TASK_RUNNING status update from executor for the first task:
{code:java}
I0125 15:59:10.749639 13385 slave.cpp:4809] Handling status update TASK_RUNNING (Status UUID: 3f205fcb-84c2-4448-91ca-fe3c5240c2a4) for task 2d82cb33-3a9f-4dba-a1b4-e27819dec216 of framework 3cef0c75-fa4f-4ec3-a995-d8b63e9b571e-0000
{code}
But such status update was never forwarded to master, I only see theÂ TASK_RUNNING status update for the second task was forwarded to master:
{code:java}
I0125 15:59:10.757285 13385 slave.cpp:5291] Forwarding the update TASK_RUNNING (Status UUID: 2c93c767-ab4a-4bb5-932b-b3d266b0a950) for task 6d37c2ba-16ff-4cc8-80b7-9a1e673ce5b2 of framework 3cef0c75-fa4f-4ec3-a995-d8b63e9b571e-0000 to master@172.16.10.241:45463
{code}
Not sure why the TASK_RUNNING status update for the first task was lost in agent.
