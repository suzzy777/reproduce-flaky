[~jcamachorodriguez] can you please take a look?

I guess this will increase our ptest time?

No this will not. Each test has to be explicitly annotated with RetryTestRunner or Retry test rule. In the patch I have annotated only 2 tests.

[~vgarg], only two tests are currently being annotated, and the repetition only happens when there is a failure, hence we should be fine. Uploading patch again to retrigger run will cause more delay.

Pushed to master, thanks [~prasanth_j]

Sounds good. 

This is released in Hive 3.1.0.
