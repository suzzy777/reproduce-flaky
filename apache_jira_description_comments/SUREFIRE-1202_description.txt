I couldn't find this limitation documented anywhere, but if I try to use the options {{rerunFailingTestsCount}} and {{skipAfterFailureCount}} together, I get this error message:

{noformat}
org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoFailureException: 
Parameters ["rerunFailingTestsCount", "skipAfterFailureCount"] 
should not be enabled together
{noformat}

I have a use case which requires both options: some integration tests are flaky, so I want to use {{rerunFailingTestsCount}} to repeat them, but if all tests are failing (eg due to a configuration problem or a really bad change), I don't want to wait for the entire test suite to fail multiple times, so I would like to abort if say 10 tests have failed.
