Some more explanation why I think that this is a good idea:
Our test suites are in a bad shape, but we often don't get enough information from the trimmed stack traces about the problem.
This should make the test failures (especially the flaky hairy ones) more actionable.

If someone is in the process of developing tests, and the output is too much, it's really easy to turn trimming back on.

I have added the PR for all five repos. 
Each one simply adds <trimStackTrace>false</trimStackTrace> to the pluginManagement section of the parent pom,
except for phoenix, where I also did some consolidation of the common configuration parameters.

It would be nice to get a general +1 to all five repos, so that this does not drag forever.
(Provided that enough ppl agree that this is a good idea) 
Just getting this into the main phoenix repo would be a win.

Alternatively, we could add the same to the Jenkins jobs, but that would be my second choice.

Committed to all three phoenix* repos.

In the meantime I've realized that I should probably create TEPHRA- and OMID- tickets for those repos.

Thanks for the reviews [~ankit] and [~dbwong]

PHOENIX-5814 disable trimStackTrace (stoty: rev 40bcc0184d3f7257ba2ce98b045d6e8a41f58a00)
* (edit) pom.xml


Patch has been applied to the phoenix* repositories, and I've opened clone tickets for Omid and Tephra, so there's nothing more to do here.

The PQS patch had a typo. I've pushed an addendum with the fix.
