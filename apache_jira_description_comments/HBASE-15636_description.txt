HBaseTestingUtility#waitUntilAllRegionsAssigned(final TableName tableName) hard coded 60 seconds wait for region assignment in a table.  This could cause flaky tests, as the caller could create table with longs of region which takes longs time; or in CM, RS unavailable could slow down assignment; or in a slow machine, IT might take long to assign regions.  

In HBaseAdmin.java, we use a configurable value to wait for the table DDLs: {{this.syncWaitTimeout = this.conf.getInt("hbase.client.sync.wait.timeout.msec", 10 * 60000); // 10min}} - we should use the config for the HBaseTestingUtility#waitUntilAllRegionsAssigned() too.

Of course, the caller could use the "public void waitUntilAllRegionsAssigned(final TableName tableName, final long timeout)"; but it requires test change (currently, no test directly calls this signature).
