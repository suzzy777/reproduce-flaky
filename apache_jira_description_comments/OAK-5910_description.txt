The idea is to reduce the amount of extra byte buffers created when reading mmapped records, if possible pushing the ByteBuffer all the way to the consumer.
For example reading a String from a Segment right now means first reading the bytes of of the record into a byte array, then creating a string with an encoding (which behind the scenes will copy the byte array again and run it through the decoder). An alternative is to call {{decode}} on the Charset and pass in the ByteBuffer, skipping the intermediate operations.

There are a few cases of this I included in the patch, but there may be others (like the {{SegmentStream}} which needs a full rewrite).

Interested in what others think of this!
