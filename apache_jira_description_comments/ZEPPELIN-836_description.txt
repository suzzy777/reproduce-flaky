We have CI failing on webapp build with no particular reason.

I.e 
https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/127274787/log.txt in https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/870

It looks like `after_failure` script was not executed in such case.

Failure should at least include webapp build logs to be able to debug it further.
