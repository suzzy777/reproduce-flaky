sample build for 3.11: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra/346/workflows/66fdf4c4-7502-4d73-b1a6-bf7d37ec1f5e/jobs/1744

I took the test list from the job and reran locally; test passes just fine.

I ran the following test list

{code}
auth_test.py::TestAuth::test_login bootstrap_test.py::TestBootstrap::test_bootstrap_waits_for_streaming_to_finish consistency_test.py::TestConsistency::test_12872 cqlsh_tests/test_cqlsh.py::TestCqlshSmoke::test_batch disk_balance_test.py::TestDiskBalance::test_disk_balance_after_joining_ring_stcs materialized_views_test.py::TestMaterializedViews::test_ttl pushed_notifications_test.py::TestPushedNotifications::test_schema_changes replace_address_test.py::TestReplaceAddress::test_insert_data_during_replace_different_address schema_metadata_test.py::TestSchemaMetadata::test_static_column thrift_hsha_test.py::TestThriftHSHA::test_closing_connections thrift_test.py::TestMutations::test_super_subcolumn_limit user_types_test.py::TestUserTypes::test_type_secondary_indexing
{code}

In this run I had consistency_test.TestConsistency#test_12872 fail, but here is the results for this test

{code}
  <testcase classname="thrift_hsha_test.TestThriftHSHA" file="thrift_hsha_test.py" line="35" name="test_closing_connections" time="167.48370265960693">
    <system-out>7:52:16,991 ccm DEBUG Log-watching thread starting.</system-out>
  </testcase>
{code}
