In the last 10 CI runs, the following tests have failed:
* TestBeeLineDriver.testCliDriver.insert_overwrite_local_directory_1 6 times
* TestCliDriver.testCliDriver.union36 3 times
* TestMiniLlapCliDriver.testCliDriver.orc_ppd_basic 3 times
* TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver.testCliDriver.vector_if_expr 3 times
* TestPerfCliDriver.testCliDriver.query14 7 times
* TestPerfCliDriver.testCliDriver.query16 3 times
* TestPerfCliDriver.testCliDriver.query23 5 times
* TestPerfCliDriver.testCliDriver.query94 3 times
* TestBlobstoreCliDriver.testCliDriver.insert_overwrite_dynamic_partitions_merge_move 6 times
* TestBlobstoreCliDriver.testCliDriver.insert_overwrite_dynamic_partitions_merge_only 6 times
* TestBlobstoreCliDriver.testCliDriver.insert_overwrite_dynamic_partitions_move_only 6 times
* TestMiniSparkOnYarnCliDriver.testCliDriver.spark_dynamic_partition_pruning_mapjoin_only 6 times
* TestMiniSparkOnYarnCliDriver.testCliDriver.spark_vectorized_dynamic_partition_pruning 7 times
* TestHCatClient.testPartitionRegistrationWithCustomSchema 7 times
* TestHCatClient.testPartitionSpecRegistrationWithCustomSchema 7 times
* TestHCatClient.testTableSchemaPropagation 7 times

All of these should be disabled until the reason for their flakiness can be determined.

Thanks [~gates] to bring this up!
I really hate these continuously failing tests so I agree that we should solve them. I have information about some of them:
- TestBeeLineDriver.testCliDriver.insert_overwrite_local_directory_1 - For the BeeLine tests [~zsombor.klara] has a patch which most probably solves the problem: HIVE-17322
- TestMiniSparkOnYarnCliDriver.testCliDriver.spark_dynamic_partition_pruning_mapjoin_only - I have a patch (HIVE-17292) where I will be update the golden files. It was missing from HIVE-16948.
- TestMiniSparkOnYarnCliDriver.testCliDriver.spark_dynamic_partition_pruning - I have committed HIVE-17305 yesterday which should solve this issue

I know about these, and not sure about how to handle them. Why we are not reverting the patch which caused the failures?
- TestMiniSparkOnYarnCliDriver.testCliDriver.spark_vectorized_dynamic_partition_pruning - Most probably cause by HIVE-16273
- TestHCatClient - Caused by HIVE-16844

Thanks,
Peter

Just a small clarification HIVE-17305  is fixing 3 tests:
-TestBlobstoreCliDriver.testCliDriver.insert_overwrite_dynamic_partitions_merge_move 
-TestBlobstoreCliDriver.testCliDriver.insert_overwrite_dynamic_partitions_merge_only
-TestBlobstoreCliDriver.testCliDriver.insert_overwrite_dynamic_partitions_move_only
These 3 are not failing anymore, sorry that it took so long to fix.
Unfortunately it will *not* fix TestMiniSparkOnYarnCliDriver.testCliDriver.spark_dynamic_partition_pruning.

You are right [~zsombor.klara], made a copy-paste mistake :)

Thanks for tracking down all these things.

I'm all for fixing these issues and reverting those we can't fix over just turning off the tests.  Let's use this as an umbrella JIRA to track those others and get them in, then we'll turn off whatever tests we can't fix or revert.
