In TestEntityGroupFSTimelineStore, testCleanLogs fails when run after testMoveToDone.

testCleanLogs fails because testMoveToDone moves a file into the same directory that testCleanLogs cleans, causing testCleanLogs to clean 3 files, instead of 2 as testCleanLogs expects.

To fix the failure of testCleanLogs, we can delete the file after the file is moved by testMoveToDone.
