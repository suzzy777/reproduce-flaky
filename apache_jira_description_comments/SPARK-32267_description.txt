PySpark tests became flaky apparently due to the machines being slow. The parallelism of PySpark increased at SPARK-26148 to speed up.

Maybe we should decrease it to make the test stability better. It will only increase around 10 minutes which is rather a small portion compared to 6 ~ 7 hours in total testing time.
