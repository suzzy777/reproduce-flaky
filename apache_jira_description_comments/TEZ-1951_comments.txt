[~zjffdu] Do you see anything in the changes that might make TestAMRecovery.testVertexCompletelyFinished_Broadcast flaky?

{code}
<Class name="org.apache.tez.dag.app.rm.YarnTaskSchedulerService$DelayedContainerManager"/>
{code}
I think  tryAssigningAll was meant to be inside the synchronized block in this case.

{code}+    this.localDirs = localDirs.clone();
+    this.logDirs = logDirs.clone();
{code}
localDirs and logDirs are only exposed to internal code. In runtime-internals I've ignored such warnings.

The other changes in DAGAppMaster - are they primarily formatting changes, with INTERNAL_ERROR added as a new case ?

{code}
-      this.pullAttempt = null;
       this.writeLock.unlock();
       // KKK Moves it out of the lock - so theoretically thread safe. Likely need a final inside
+      this.pullAttempt = null;
{code}
This moves resetting of pullAttempt outside of the lock, which can cause visibility issues. This may need to be a new finally block under the upper else condition.


{code}
+    return ( this.tsLogParams == null ? null : this.tsLogParams.clone() );
{code}
Never exposed to user code, safe to ignore ?

Rest looks good.


Addressed comments. Remove accidental indent edits in DAGAppMaster.

+1. Looks good.
