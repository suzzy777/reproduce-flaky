Whenever the IndexFetcher class is called for recovery or replication the HTTP requests are unauthenticated resulting in 401 errors:

 
{code:java}

I checked the source code and before creating a new HTTP client in IndexFetcher it tries to get http auth user/password from initArgs but those properties are always null, event if I set them in the replication handler (under the slave tag).

 
{code:java}
 <lst name="slave">
<str name="masterUrl">http://remote_host:port/solr/core_name/replication</str>
 <str name="httpBasicAuthUser">username</str>
<str name="httpBasicAuthPassword">password</str>
</lst>
{code}
  

I downloaded the solr source code and entered the username and password hardcoded, compiled the jar and everything was working fine. Before this I used the logger to check the httpBasicAuthUser/httpBasicAuthPassword and whenever IndexFetcher was called for recovery or replication these fields were null.
