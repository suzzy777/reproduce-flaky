Most of the work is already done to support more than 2 NameNodes (one active, one standby). This would be the last bit to support running multiple _standby_ NameNodes; one of the standbys should be available for fail-over.

Mostly, this is a matter of updating how we parse configurations, some complexity around managing the checkpointing, and updating a whole lot of tests.
