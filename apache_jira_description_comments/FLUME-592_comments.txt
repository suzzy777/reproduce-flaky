Here is the list of flaky tests

These should be fixed:
* TestDiskFailoverSource.java  
* TestNaiveFileWALSource.java  
* TestDiskFailoverBehavior.java
* TestDiskFailoverAgent.java
* TestAgentSink.java
* TestWriteAheadLogDecorator.java
* TestContextThreading.java
* TestDiskFailoverBenchmarking.java
* TestDiskFailoverThenRoll.java
* TestAgentFailChainSink.java
* TestNaiveFileWALManagerConcurrently.java

These are still flaky
* TestChokeDecos.java
* TestCollectorSink.java

Roughly the best order to review these patches are:
* FLUME-586 (This fixed TestDiskFailoverSource and TestNaiveFileWALSource)
* FLUME-569, FLUME-593, FLUME-596, FLUME-589, FLUME-595 (Fixes the bulk of the fixed flakies, breaks some others tests along the way).
* FLUME-597 (TestDiskFailoverSource and TestNaiveFileWALSource fixed after semantics changes)
* FLUME-598 (Restores behavior of newly broken tests).

The bulk of these patches have been running and passting the flakey tests every 15 minutes for on the order of 24-48 hours (Some longer).  There are a handful new mostly deterministically broken tests that were fixed more recently.  There was also a test run of the end-to-end tests (scripting through the shell) which seems to have worked.

Hm.. TestAgentSink flaked out. :(

TestNaiveFileWALManagerConcurrently  still fails intermittently.  This is usually the testSharedDecoHuge
test due to unable to allocate thread error.  This test consumes many threads is more likely when the machine is under heavy load.


TestAgentFailChainSink testConfirmBEChain still fails intermittently.


I'm going to defer complete resolution of this to the 0.9.5 release.  At the time of this comment, we have resolved a significant majority of the intermittent tests.  

Scoped this out for v0.9.4.  Will create new umbrella issue for v0.9.5
