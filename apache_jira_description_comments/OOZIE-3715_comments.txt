[~chenhd] Thanks for your patch. Unfortunately it does not apply: [https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/PreCommit-OOZIE-Build/200/consoleText]

You've created your change on top of master branch, right?

[~dionusos] Yes. That's strange ,  I've created the change on top of master branch. And I don't know why patch error? The error message said that "No such file or directory" and "error: while searching for:".

Hello [~chenhd],
thanks for the provided patch.

The issue you are facing is happening because you did not use the *--no-prefix* flag when you created the patch, which is needed as it is described in the [Oozie's How To Contribute|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOZIE/How+To+Contribute] page.

Furthermore, considering your change, we would also like to ask a unit test which validates the change you have provided.

Thank you.

[~chenhd] looks like the format of the patch is OK now, but please fix the following two issues before moving forward:
 * repair the line too long issue which is indicated by the raw patch analysis
 * modify/create unit test case(s) to validate the purpose of this change

Thank you

Hello [~chenhd], 
Thank you for your patience in waiting for my feedback.

Based on your initial statement and the test code, it is my understanding that the test case ({*}org.apache.oozie.command.wf.TestSignalXCommand#testForkSubmitFail{*}) should fail without any changes made to {*}SignalXCommand{*}.
However, despite having commented out the new line in *SignalXCommand* on my local computer, the test case still managed to succeed.

Please inform me if my comprehension is accurate.

Considering the perspective of clean code, my observations are:
 * Please do not use star import ({*}{color:#0747a6}import org.apache.oozie.service.*;{color}{*})

 * Fix the 1 line that is longer than 132 characters ({*}org.apache.oozie.command.wf.TestSignalXCommand#504{*})

 * Kindly furnish a comprehensive Javadoc description for the new test case.

 * The new test case contains unnecessary code duplications. Specifically, in {*}org.apache.oozie.command.wf.TestSignalXCommand#_testForkSubmitFail{*}, the two implemented scenarios differ only in the value assigned to {*}org.apache.oozie.command.wf.SignalXCommand#FORK_PARALLEL_JOBSUBMISSION{*}. To prevent duplication, this test case could be parameterized based on this difference.

 * {+}Question{+}: Why the extra *{color:#0747a6}Thread.sleep(500);{color}* is needed in {*}org.apache.oozie.command.wf.TestSignalXCommand#493{*}, after the while loop?

 * Please ensure consistent spacing throughout the code. For instance, in the following line: 

{code:java}
while (!WorkflowJob.Status.FAILED.equals( engine.getJob(jobId).getStatus())){
{code}
 there is an extraneous space before "engine," and no space before the closing bracket. Please apply this same consideration to every instance in the code.

[~jmakai]  Thank for you patience in guidance .

I have fixed my mistake. 

I have change the *Test* action run as async, when the action2 at the *RUNNING* status, it always in this status. The appendix *forkSubmitFail_issue.txt* is the result execute in my compute, thx.{*}
{*}

 

And the question about Why the extra *{color:#0747a6}Thread.sleep(500);{color}* is needed in {*}org.apache.oozie.command.wf.TestSignalXCommand#493{*}, after the while loop?

Because maybe it just change the job status and not yet execute KillXCommand,  so   {color:#172b4d}after the while loop{color} *{color:#0747a6}Thread.sleep(500);{color}* 

{color:#172b4d}Thank you again for your help.{color}

[~chenhd] 

Thank you for the changes, the latest patch looks better and the unit test seems to work as expected.

Two more minor things I have found that I would like to request:
 * I think the newly created JavaDoc is only needed for {*}org.apache.oozie.command.wf.TestSignalXCommand#testForkSubmitFail{*}.
I have rephrased it a little bit, if you do not mind:
{code:java}
/**
 * This method tests the behavior of a scenario where a fork parallel submit is initiated, and one of the
 * transitions fail, resulting in the job failing, while the other transition's state is about to be checked.
 * The test verifies that a PreconditionException is thrown when action2 is in the RUNNING or PREP state 
 *
 * @throws Exception if an error occurs during the test.
 */
{code}

 * Spacing is still a little bit off in your following comment:
{code:java}
// Fork out more than one transitions ,one submit fail can't execute KillXCommand
{code}

----

Using on the current state I will execute some system tests to ensure the change does not cause regression. I will get back to you as soon as I will have results.

[~jmakai] OK , Thank for your patience. I found it in the Live environment，the subworkflow failed because of the xml fault in submitting，and the other has submit to yarn stay Running. Like the appendix _*status.png.*_

Thanks for your time.{*}{*}

[~jmakai] have you had a chance to test this change? Thanks

I apologize for the delay in responding as I was extremely busy in the past few days. However, I have now conducted system tests on this modification and it did not result in any regression. Additionally, the unit tests appear to be satisfactory.

[~dionusos], do you have any other feedback or remarks regarding this change?

Thank you

I have some comments:
**

*core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/command/wf/SignalXCommand.java*
Typo in line 552: {{transitions ,one}} should be {{transitions, one}}
{code:java}
// Fork out more than one transitions ,one submit fail can't execute KillXCommand {code}
Please reword the above comment

*core/src/test/java/org/apache/oozie/command/wf/TestSignalXCommand.java*

Please remove or fill  {{@throws Exception}} Java doc lines.

{*}L420-421{*}: two empty lines instead of one

{*}L429{*}: {{public void testForkSubmitFail() throws Exception{}} - missing space between Exception and {

{*}L429-432{*}: Let's create 2 separated test cases (1 for true, 1 for false with self-explaining names) so when one scenario fails it is easier to understand
{code:java}
public void testForkSubmitFail() throws Exception{
  _testForkSubmitFail(true);
  _testForkSubmitFail(false);
} {code}
{*}L439{*}: {{@param isForkParallelSubmit. (ture or fail)}} - typo in "ture", fail should be "false", unnecessary dot

{*}L442{*}: {{_testForkSubmitFail}} method should be private, and should be used Java naming convention: instead of _test... run...

{*}L494{*}: Instead of XConfiguration please use Configuration.

{*}L518{*}: {{assertTrue(WorkflowAction.Status.FAILED.equals(failAction.getStatus()));}} - should be assertEquals, also please provide reason message: assertEquals("reason", expected, actual)

{*}L522{*}: {{System.out.println(bean.getStatus());}} - line should be removed

{*}L513-514{*}: failAction and otherAction are unnecessary variables. You could use *action_to_be_succeeded* instead of *action1* and the same to the other action name.
add an assertion for actions.size = 2

{*}L524{*}: Instead of
{code:java}
                assertTrue(WorkflowAction.Status.KILLED.equals(otherAction.getStatus())
                        || WorkflowAction.Status.OK.equals(otherAction.getStatus()) );
{code}
use
{code:java}
                if (!WorkflowAction.Status.KILLED.equals(otherAction.getStatus()) || !WorkflowAction.Status.OK.equals(otherAction.getStatus())) {
                    fail("reason...");
                }
{code}
and add an explanation why these two states are accepted. *KILLED* and *OK* are totally different. Please comment there why and how each can be the status of action2. If the status depends on something, for e.g 
isForkParallelSubmit please use it in the assertion.

 

Thanks

Denes

[~dionusos] OK, Thank for you patience in guidance.

Hi, [~dionusos] ,do you have any other feedback or remarks regarding this change({*}OOZIE-3715-005.patch{*} )？ Thank you！

[~chenhd] 

In TestSignalXCommand please don't use infinite loop:
{code:java}
while (!WorkflowJob.Status.FAILED.equals( engine.getJob(jobId).getStatus() )){
    Thread.sleep(500);
} {code}
but invoke *waitFor* method as can be seen in other test cases.

Also please use "uri:oozie:workflow:1.0" instead of "uri:oozie:workflow:0.4" in the same file and remove space after '(' and before ')'.

 

Always compare constant to variable:
{code:java}
"somestring".equals(action.getName()) {code}
 

Isn't there a way to swap
{code:java}
// wait for execute KillXCommand
Thread.sleep(500);{code}
to some safer implementation? Waiting 500 ms may be not enough in some cases so this could became an intermittently failing test case which we must avoid. Isn't there an indicator which we could check in a waitFor method like size of a list of an SQL query executed via JPAExecutor?

Thanks
