There are some places in code, when we are reading/writing to files and we do not define any character set, so the default one will be used. Since the default implementation may change between the java versions our output will be platform dependent.

For example if we have a shell action with a script that will echo something using Chinese text, '????' are be printed in case of jdk1.8.0_141.
