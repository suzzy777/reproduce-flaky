I met this issue as well. [~mjsax] Could I take over this one?

the root cause is the “shutdown” may obstruct consumer to complete the group join. If the consumer wakes up before completing the partition assignments, the consumer is in a state of UNJOINED (so it won’t send LeaveGroupRequest when closing) and the broker is in a state of CompletingRebalance until timeout.
 
To fix the flaky, we should wait all groups are in Stable state to make sure all Consumers have completed the group joining (so they are able to send LeaveGroupRequest when closing).

Different test `testDeleteEmptyGroup` is also flaky:

[~mjsax] testDeleteEmptyGroup is fixed by the PR as well. All testDeleteXX cases have same issue so probably issue title should be changed.
