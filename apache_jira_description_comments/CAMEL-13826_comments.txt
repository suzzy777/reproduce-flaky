Perhaps it might be good to name the new component {{camel-test-jupiter}} or {{camel-test-junit-jupiter}}, if I recall correctly, the engine of JUnit 5 is called Jupiter.

It's true that jupiter is more accurate in a way. And JUnit 5 could seems clearer to some users. I think you idea is a good opportunity to collect feedbacks in review or a kind of vote :+1

Hmm I am not keen of such name. 

People in general knows it as junit. And they would look for junit 5 support.

The name IMHO should either be

- camel-test5
- camel-test-junit5

The shorter name is what we are using generally, and gets my vote

+1 for camel-test-junit5

I think we should shield users from version changes. That's why I wonder if we'll need to create or rename {{camel-test-junit5}} to {{camel-test-junit6}} at some point in the future. I think putting versions in components has already caused us problems, and required users to perform, some times trivial, migrations.

We need to keep camel-test around as its the primary test module until this new one is stable and we have upgraded to junit 5. And then at a time we can drop camel-test and rename camel-junit5 to camel-test etc.
