Right now, we need to use .setMaxPatternLength() method to
specify is the maximum pattern length of a sequence. Any pattern longer than that won't be outputted.

The current default maxPatternlength value being 10.

This should be changed so that with input 0, all pattern of any length would be outputted. Additionally, the default value should be changed to 0, so that a new user could find all patterns in his dataset without looking at this parameter.
