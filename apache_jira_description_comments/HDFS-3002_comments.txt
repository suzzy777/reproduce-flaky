Hey Suresh, seems like this might be (at least partially) a duplicate of HDFS-2966?

In that jira, we are still adding wait time. I agree that our wait times for an even to happen could make the tests flaky. The main point of this jira is to not wait for updation of metrics. Perhaps I can add this comment to that jira and close this.

After looking at the patch on HDFS-2966, these are unrelated issues. I am removing updateMetrics() method calls.

bq. After looking at the patch on HDFS-2966, these are unrelated issues. I am removing updateMetrics() method calls.

Not entirely unrelated. The patch for HDFS-2966 is also removing a few calls to updateMetrics(...), but only those which pertain to DN metrics, which still do take a little time to update. In your patch, you replaced those particular calls to direct calls to Thread.sleep(...).

Regardless, the patch here looks good to me. +1. Once this is committed, we'll just have to rev the patch for HDFS-2966 a little bit, since I'm pretty sure they'll conflict slightly.

The Thread.sleep() part and waitForDeletion() is what HDFS-2966 is mainly concerned about. However, metrics is being used for detecting the completion of an activity it is waiting for completion. I can rebase HDFS-2966 after committing this patch.

Sounds good to me. Thanks a lot, Suresh.

HDFS-2966 is independent of this as it is designed to handle the test failing on an overloaded system where the replication takes longer than the sleep times, so they both need to go in, though -2966 is a hard one to replicate. I will gladly let Suresh rebase that patch once this is in.

Hey Suresh, I see that you committed this to trunk. I was about to resolve it for you, but then I noticed that you had the "affects version" set to 0.23.0, but with no "target version" set.

Do you intend to commit this to 0.23 as well? Seems to me like we should.
