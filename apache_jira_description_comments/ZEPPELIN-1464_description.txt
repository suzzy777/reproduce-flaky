On https://travis-ci.org/apache/zeppelin/builds/161286976
You can see the that only one build profile (7259.6) is failing with:
```
Failed tests: 
  InterpreterRestApiTest.testSettingsCRUD:118 Test delete method:
Expected: HTTP response <200> from /api/interpreter/setting/2BXVE2G5P
     but: got <500> Server Error

Tests run: 45, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

Now, one weird thing is that the profile have the -DskipTest option, so I'm not sure why we are running any tests there
