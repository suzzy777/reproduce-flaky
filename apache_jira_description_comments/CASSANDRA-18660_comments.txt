I think this is perhaps environmental, nothing is really going on here besides stopping and starting node2.  In the debug log for node2 in both cases I can see it started listening for cql before the timeout but it just wasn't seen by others, even though node2 saw all the nodes.  I haven't been able to reproduce locally yet either.

Regardless of the reason why some nodes aren't seeing the restart, we don't need them to if we're waiting for CQL to come up. Unless the test requires that, which it doesn't since it's going to query each node individually, over CQL.  So let's just do [that|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/commit/1ffd4d3892a743c4bc65cd89eb8a59a7b588c60d].

If you can't repro locally there's nothing else we can do. It still irks me the others didn't notice bc as you say the logs seem correct. If there is some ccm bug we'll hear about it. For the time being this is the best we can do agreed. +1

Committed w/note, thanks!
