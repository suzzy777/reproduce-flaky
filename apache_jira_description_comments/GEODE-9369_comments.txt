GEODE-9369: Command to copy region entries from a WAN site to another (#6833)

* GEODE-9369: Command to copy region entries from a WAN site to another (#6601)

* GEODE-9369: Command to copy region entries from a WAN site to another

The command has been implemented as proposed in
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Geode+Command+to+replicate+region+data+from+one+site+to+another+connected+via+WAN
with some modifications with respect to the initial proposal.

The command will get the entries of a region
in a WAN site and will put them in batches
that will be sent by a gateway sender to a remote
WAN site.

* GEODE-9369: Remove comments added to geode-gfsh/src/test/resources/expected-pom.xml

* GEODE-9369: Changes after review

* GEODE-9369: Update with Kirk's review comments

* GEODE-9369: Updated with DonalEvan's comments

* GEODE-9369: Small refactoring: Use CompletableFuture instead of Callable + FutureTask

* GEODE-9369: Fix race condition added in previous commit

* GEODE-9369: Small change of re-review from DonalEvans

* GEODE-9369: Fix esporadic test failures due to error log.

* GEODE-9369: Changes required after rebasing to develop

* GEODE-9369: Add changes suggested by klund

- Remove sleeps in unit tests that made some of them flaky, especially in windows
- Remove use of DEEP_STUBS in mocks
- Move new function to geode-wan
- Handle the lifecycle of the executor used by the function
  in a new CacheService class in wan
- Remove partial mocking in unit tests

* GEODE-9369: Create a new CliFunction inside geode-core

In order to be able to use CliFunction in WanCopyRegion
without adding a dependency to geode-gfsh, I created a
CliFunction class inside geode-core which is a copy of
that same class in geode-gfsh.
At first I thought about moving the class from geode-gfsh
to geode-core which seemed more logical but I realized it
would break the compatibility of a public API.

* GEODE-9369: Changes after klund's review

Revert "GEODE-9369: Command to copy region entries from a WAN site to another (#6833)" (#7005)

This reverts commit c106e017b2e2ddc07a299bc3d47f6a4baae1451a.

I had to revert this change because of failures in WanCopyRegionCommandDUnitTest on Windows.
