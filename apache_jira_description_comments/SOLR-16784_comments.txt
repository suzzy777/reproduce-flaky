SOLR-16784 Badapple CollectionReloadTest (#1621)

Signed-off-by: Jan Høydahl <janhoy@users.noreply.github.com>

Procedurally, shouldn't this stay open until the test is fixed? BadApple only serves to avoid impeding other development, It doesn't really seem like a resolution.

Re-opening; Gus is absolutely right.

I noticed that this test failed when the Crave based tests were run for a PR: https://github.com/apache/solr/actions/runs/4930906001/jobs/8812395966?pr=1636

I was under the impression that marking it as BadApple would take the test out of rotation?  Or do we need to tell crave to NOT run badapple tests?

As I understand it BadApples are tests that test something important but are flaky. They are important tests that need to be fixed, but an accumulation of flakey tests will make it impossible to move forward with changes because every individual developer needs to do their own tracking and analysis and run multiple times to see if any of the flakey tests are actual real failures. BadApple is a community acknowledgement that this test fails frequently, and thus avoids the massive duplication of effort. 

IIRC we settled on associating the BadApple annotation with a Jira to make sure that these *temporary* annotations were not forgotten. If we close the associated issue, then we need some other way of tracking tests that are flaky and in need of fixing.

If the test is so bad that it is impossible to fix it, or it is testing something unimportant we don't need a BadApple, we need to delete the test.

Humm...   So I introduced it, but I didn't actually write it, and that whole area is something I'm not familiar with (and currently don't have the technical chops to try and dig in to fix)...   So...    I think if no one steps up to fix it, I'll remove it.  Maybe I'll give it till the end of the week?

+1 Let's revert or disable the test until someone has time to look at it

Thanks [~noble] for adding the Ignore, I had forgotton about that annotation and was thinking the only option was a delete ;-)

I think I have a potential fix for this test. will post tomorrow morning a PR for review

apologies for the delay, I posted a PR for review https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1621

Alex, you meant: https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1662  (strange it wasn't auto-linked; looks like it should have)

yes absolutely! weird copy/pasta on my part... thanks David
