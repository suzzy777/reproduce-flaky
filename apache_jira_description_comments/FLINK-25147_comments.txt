Big +1 for this. Can you help with this [~echauchot] ?

[~MartijnVisser] sure

AFAICT, only _CassandraConnectorItCase_ needs to be migrated to testContainers, all the other tests of this connector use mocks.

And BTW, thanks for adding the links to all the flaky tests tickets [~MartijnVisser] !

FYI I just submitted the PR

master: c4b10caeb0b7f69b79b9a27f7e1666c0009da7c6

[~chesnay] I also backported the change to release-1.13 and release-1.14 branches

https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/18138
https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/18140


[~chesnay] you closed the ticket, does it mean that the backports above are not needed?

Took a look at tests history and so far so good, no cassandra failure since the merge to master

Thanks a lot [~echauchot] - With regards to backports, would those help with any of the instabilities of the subtasks? 

[~MartijnVisser] they should. 1.14 and 1.13 suffer from the same instabilities than master. It seems that there is no more flakiness on master since 12/17th. So 1.14 and 1.13 should profit from the same fix. And in time we will see if the flakiness is solved by the migration to testContainers. I think we should merge this on all branches and monitor flakiness for 2 weeks.


[~trohrmann] Do you think you could merge the backports from [~echauchot] ? Those should help in addressing some of the Cassandra test instabilities that we've seen before. 

PRs can be found a little higher in the comments, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-25147?focusedCommentId=17461399&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17461399

Yes, I will merge the backports.

Thanks [~trohrmann] ! and thanks [~MartijnVisser] !

[~echauchot] [~trohrmann] What do we do with the subtasks? I'm leaning towards closing those that should be fixed now that Cassandra is running on testcontainers and re-open them in case they re-appear. WDYT? 

[~MartijnVisser] flakiness issues seem to be related to load. testContainers should reduce load a bit but that may not be enough. I'd recommend to wait a bit util we have enough history to close them. We can set a cut off at, let's say, new year and close them if they don't appear until then.

Sounds good to me. Thanks [~echauchot]

[~MartijnVisser] my pleasure ! Thanks for updating the linked tickets with this status.
