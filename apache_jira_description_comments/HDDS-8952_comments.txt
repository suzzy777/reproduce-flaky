[~georgeJahad], I think this duplicates HDDS-8880. I've linked thread dumps from a few failed test runs there, they are similar to what you posted.

Thanks for pointing out the problem with simple key creation. I've tried that (locally) in {{TestOMRatisSnapshots}} and in a similar test class with Ozone's default config. The problem only happens with the specific configurations set in {{{}TestOMRatisSnapshots{}}}. Maybe there is a bug in how OM uses Ratis, or in Ratis itself, but maybe the configs of the test are simply wrong.

default config: https://github.com/adoroszlai/hadoop-ozone/actions/runs/5415806490
snapshot config: https://github.com/adoroszlai/hadoop-ozone/actions/runs/5415810459

 

[~adoroszlai] 

We are concerned about the fact that TestOMRatisSnapshots is disabled while we continue to make significant changes to the snapshotting codebase.  I'm afraid people will make breaking changes that go unnoticed because those tests are disabled.

We'd like to come up with a workaround that keeps as much of the testing as possible while finding a workaround for the flakiness.  Here is our current proposal:

The TestOMRatisSnapshots flakiness got bad in this commit: 9f6cb9de5596fc2228bb6baf58ead6b713036757 because it added a lot more writes to the test.  So we would like to restore that class to the previous revision: cc1d2b3984194d22027fc119c05329e1c9e73c5f

 

Then we will move the latest changes to a new class that will have the ratis parameters modified to eliminate the flakiness.

There have been two tests that have changed since that revision: testInstallIncrementalSnapshot() and testInstallSnapshot().  So those two tests will exist in both classes: the old versions in the old class with the old ratis parameters, and those two tests in a new class with the parameters changed.

That will keep the CI working for now until we figure out the right solution.  Does that seem reasonable?

[~georgeJahad], sorry for disabling the test without notification.  I should have tagged you in HDDS-8880.  Fork timeout (after 20 minutes) happened in 8 out of 17 runs after your commit, not to mention runs in PRs and forks.  First I marked it as flaky, but it didn't help, due to the nature of the failure (fork timeout, instead of test failure/timeout).  See commit history: https://github.com/apache/ozone/commits/master?after=43d8e667c375bb9fe8829ba50b86f7a87e3edf5f+0

Here's my latest attempt to reduce the number of test cases disabled:
https://github.com/apache/ozone/compare/master...adoroszlai:hadoop-ozone:HDDS-8880-tweak

In this patch, only {{testInstallSnapshot}} is left disabled.  {{testInstallIncrementalSnapshotWithFailure}} is marked as flaky.  Mini cluster shutdown timed out in [2/100 runs|https://github.com/adoroszlai/hadoop-ozone/actions/runs/5435454778], but otherwise it seems OK.

Please feel free to make any changes to {{TestOMRatisSnapshots}}, taking my patch as a starting point if you wish.

No problem.  Your work on flaky tests has been critical to the team, and we really appreciate all your effort!

What we are currently thinking of is starting with your tweaks and running testInstallSnapshot like so:  https://github.com/apache/ozone/compare/adoroszlai:hadoop-ozone:HDDS-8880-tweak...GeorgeJahad:ozone:georgeTweak  We will test it out and let you know.
