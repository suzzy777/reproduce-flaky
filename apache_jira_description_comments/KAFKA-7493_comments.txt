Since this is not a blocker issue, as part of the 2.6.0 release process I'm changing the fix version to `2.7.0`. If this is incorrect, please respond and discuss on the "[DISCUSS] Apache Kafka 2.6.0 release" discussion mailing list thread.

As part of the 2.7.0 release process, I'm going to move the fix version field to 2.8.0.Â 

This has been ongoing for quite a while. I'll go ahead and bump it to 3.0, since at this point, a bug must be a regression or a severe issue to continue blocking 2.8

Removing from the 3.2.0 release since code freeze has passed.
