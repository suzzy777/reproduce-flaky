It looks like this is an intermittent timing issue within the test (looking at the git history, it has been "fixed" in GEODE-2095 before to try and deal with its flaky nature). Here is the problem region of code:
{code}
 // acknowledge interactions with the mock that have occurred
 verify(mockAppender, atLeastOnce()).getName();
 verify(mockAppender, atLeastOnce()).isStarted();
 try {
    // Another delay before exiting the thread to make sure that missing region logging
    // doesn't continue after all regions are created (delay > logInterval)
    Thread.sleep(logInterval * 2);
    verifyNoMoreInteractions(mockAppender);
  } finally {
    logger.removeAppender(mockAppender);
  }
{code}

There still appears to be issues with this test and validating occurrences of logging. Do we have a better pattern for doing this? Do we want to be validating the occurrence of logging at all (instead of the actual behavior that has occurred)?

Let's remove the line testing for the log message

As much as I want to remove the checking for log messages, this entire test class is completely based on log checking. This is far from ideal, but it would take a long time (and possibly significant code refactoring elsewhere) to retool this test to follow better patterns. This seems to be a rare issue, so I am leaning towards refactoring away from Thread.sleep to the more preferred pattern (used elsewhere in this test) of awaitility to hopefully stabilize this test. This may have been a missed location in the previous attempt to stabilize this test. If that does not work, we will have to consider either ignoring the test or putting in the work to redo these tests.

I found a way that seems to remove the flakyness of the test. The test was checking for asynchronous logging of a warning, then carrying out the action that should stop the warning from happening again. However, this leaves a gap for the warning to be logged an additional time and the test checks to make sure that no more invocations are made on the logger. Instead, the test should make sure that once the condition that stops the warning is completed, then there should not be any additional loggings of the warning.
