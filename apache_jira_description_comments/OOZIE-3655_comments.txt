[~dionusos] I'm not sure how to interpret the CI results. The spotbugs -1 seems to be unrelated to this. The tests have a +1 despite some failing tests - are these flaky tests that can be ignored?

Commit cb3e55d4cb2245d7ccb949f2a9f654da906f8c28 in oozie's branch refs/heads/master from Denes Bodo
[ https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=oozie.git;h=cb3e55d ]

OOZIE-3655 upgrade jdom to jdom2 2.0.6.1 (pj.fanning via dionusos)


[~pj.fanning] 

It is usual that some tests are failing for the first run but succeeds. Kind of timeouts due to the environment or failed port reservation. The issues reported Spot bugs should be handled first.

 

Anyway, your change is committed to master. Thanks for the contribution.
