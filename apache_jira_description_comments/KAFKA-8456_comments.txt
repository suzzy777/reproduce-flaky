mjsax commented on pull request #6941: KAFKA-8456: Stabilize flaky StoreUpgradeIntegrationTest

   Running those tests locally, most run about 10 seconds. The default timeout is 15 seconds. I think it makes sense to provide more head room on Jenkins.
   
   This PR increase the timeout to 60 seconds.
