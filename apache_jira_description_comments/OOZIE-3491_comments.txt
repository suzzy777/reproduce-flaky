Thanks for the patch [~matijhs]. Could you please improve the unit test a bit:
 * please add message to the {{assertEquals}}
 * please destroy the newly created Services instance, just like the other tests in that class.

Thanks for the new patch [~matijhs], could you please check the other test methods in the {{TestServices}} class? I think it would be better to put the destroy method into a finally block.

Oops, fixed :) thanks
