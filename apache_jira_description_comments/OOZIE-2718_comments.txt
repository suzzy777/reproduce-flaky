Patch OOZIE-2718-1.patch removes some redundant code in BundleSubmitXCommand to make dryrun for bundles work. With this patch, 'dryrun' of bundle does some basic verification of bundle configuration. There is existing code coverage for dryrun path of bundle submission about configuration verification(see TestBundleSubmitXCommand). Because the removal of those redundant code in issue, I was also able to remove some un-needed code in TestBundleSubmitXCommand as well.

Please take a look.

The output with patch-1 is as follows:

oozie job -oozie http://xxxxx/oozie -config xxxx.xml -dryrun

Thank you [~zhengxb2005] for picking this up!

Can you add a test in {{TestBundleSubmitXCommand}} to test dryrun?

Thx for taking a look [~gezapeti]!

There are already test cases covering dryrun: TestBundleSubmitXCommand.testJobXmlCommentRemoved and TestBundleSubmitXCommand.testDuplicateCoordName. Both of them are using 'new BundleSubmitXCommand(true, jobConf)' to run as 'dryrun'. Since you asked, I added one more assertion in 'testJobXmlCommentRemoved' in patch-3 for dryrun test case to be more clear.

I don't think above failure for latest patch is related to my change. Previous patch with similar change was passing green.

Thanks for the explanation [~zhengxb2005]! I missed that dryrun was tested already.
Failing tests passed locally.
+1 (nonbinding)

Few minor comments:

# Similar test code is available in the TestCoordUpdateXCommand#setUpBundleAndGetCoordID(), can you please take care of that as well.
# Update the documentation as well for the {{-dryrun}} into {{DG_CommandLineTool.twiki}}.

[~abhishekbafna] Thx for taking a look! I updated TestCoordUpdateXCommand#setUpBundleAndGetCoordID() and DG_CommandLineTool.twiki.

I added 'Dryrun support for bundle job is added since 4.4.0.' to the twiki assuming master is pointing to 4.4.0 release. Pls help review.

I ran all above failing tests locally, and all of them are passing. [~abhishekbafna] Can you pls take a another look?

The output of the bundle dryrun prints {{***coordJob after parsing: *** ... etc}} where as it outputs parsed bundle. [Here|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/client/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/cli/OozieCLI.java#L1005]

Also, add a section like https://oozie.apache.org/docs/4.3.0/DG_CommandLineTool.html#Dryrun_of_Workflow_Job for Bundle.

Thx for the great feedback [~abhishekbafna]! I updated the CLI output to say:
'Bundle job after parsing xxxxx', then the xml string.

I also added a section in the doc you mentioned. Pls help take another look and see if it makes sense.

Micro nit:

{code}Dryrun a workflow (since 3.3.2) or coordinator (since 2.0) job without actually executing it. Dryrun support for bundle job is added since 4.4.0.{code}

Could fit in better as:

{code}Dryrun a coordinator (since 2.0), a workflow (since 3.3.2) or a bundle (since 4.4.0) without actually executing it.{code}

LGTM otherwise! +1 pending change and further comments from [~abhishekbafna].

Thx for reviewing this [~qwertymaniac]!

I updated the documentation message according to your suggestion in patch 6.
[~abhishekbafna] [~rkanter] Can you please help review the latest patch?
