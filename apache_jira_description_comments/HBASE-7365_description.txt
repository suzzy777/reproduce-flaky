Currently tables are created in the root directory, and the removal works on the root directory.
Change the code to use a /hbase/.tmp directory to make the creation and removal a bit safer

Table Creation steps
 * Create the table descriptor (table folder, in /hbase/.tmp/)
 * Create the table regions (always in temp)
 * Move the table from temp to the root folder
 * Add the regions to meta
 * Trigger assignment
 * Set enable flag in ZooKeeper

Table Deletion steps
 * Wait for regions in transition
 * Remove regions from meta (use bulk delete)
 * Move the table in /hbase/.tmp
 * Remove the table from the descriptor cache
 * Remove table from zookeeper
 * Archive the table

The main changes in the current code are:
 * Writing to /hbase/.tmp and then rename
 * using bulk delete in DeletionTableHandler
