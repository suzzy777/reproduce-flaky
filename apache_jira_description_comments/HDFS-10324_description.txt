We encountered a bug in HDFS-8831:
After HDFS-8831, a deleted file in an encryption zone is moved to a .Trash subdirectory within the encryption zone.

However, if this .Trash subdirectory is not created beforehand, it will be created and owned by the first user who deleted a file, with permission drwx------. This creates a serious bug because any other non-privileged user will not be able to delete any files within the encryption zone, because they do not have the permission to move directories to the trash directory.

We should fix this bug, by pre-creating the .Trash directory with sticky bit.
