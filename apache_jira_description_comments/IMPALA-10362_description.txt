We found that sometimes {{LdapImpalaShellTest#testShellLdapAuth()}} failed at [https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/1c72c5a8f93ae3aa7e30b8bb59e0a18a654d0d34/fe/src/test/java/org/apache/impala/customcluster/LdapImpalaShellTest.java#L146] due to hitting an {{assertTrue()}} at [https://github.com/apache/impala/blob/master/fe/src/test/java/org/apache/impala/customcluster/RunShellCommand.java#L50].

This test was slightly revised in IMPALA-10234. Maybe [~attilaj] could offer some insight into it.

The corresponding log file is also provided. Let me know if other log files are needed as well. Thanks!
