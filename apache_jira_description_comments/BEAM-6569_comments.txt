The problem here was not a flaky test, but that the test was included twice in the test suite (see comments on [#7691|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7691])

The same mocked object is used twice, which resulted inÂ the iterator being exhausted during the second test.

In [the logs|https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Commit/4034/console] of one of the runs that flagged this test as flaky, we can see that the test passed the first time, and failed the second time.

Thanks, [~RobbeSneyders], we can re-include the test into the suite.
I wonder if it is possible to list modules one per line in alphabetical order. I tried a several options as I was preparing #7691 but none of them satisfied tox syntax. 

I looked into this when first setting up the tox environment, but also couldn't get it to work with tox syntax.

We should be able to remove the modules list and run on the full package very soon.

I looked into this test again, I think the problem is still with the test. I think throughout the test execution we hit the codepath that triggers a retry behavior in GCS client, however the mock object is not expecting an extended amount of calls triggered by retry behavior. So we would have to understand what is causing the retry.
