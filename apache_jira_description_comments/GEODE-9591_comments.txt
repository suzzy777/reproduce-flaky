jvarenina opened a new pull request #866:
URL: https://github.com/apache/geode-native/pull/866


   Fault:
   Client clears result by calling ResultCollector::clearResult and
   re-executes the function even thought Function.isHa() is set to false.
   
   Fix:
   Client will not clear result and retry the function, but it will fail with the
   received exception from server.
   
   Added integration test:
   1.FunctionExecutionTest.testThatFunctionExecutionThrowsExceptionNonHAWithFilter
   2.FunctionExecutionTest.testThatFunctionExecutionThrowsExceptionNonHA
   
   The integration test reproduces the problem in a following way:
   
   1. Populate region so that all buckets are created
   2. Shutdown one of the three available servers
   3. Peforme rebalance operation, so that buckets are recovered on running
   servers
   4. Execute the function. Function execution will fail with the
   InternalFunctionInvocationTargetException exception, because client will
   try to execute single hop function with old PR meatada information (PR
   metadata received before the rebalance operation).

   I put as review ready even thought two test jobs failed, because I think that failed test cases could be flaky:
   
   - HARegionCacheListenerARLTest.afterRegionLive 
   - TransactionCleaningTest.txWithStoppedServer

   Can confirm, if any test cases are gonna fail it'll be these two.
   
   Thanks,

   @jvarenina This one needs a little attention, I think.  If you rebase to fix the merge conflicts, we can look at the resultant CI run and see if there are any lingering test issues.

   Hi @pdxcodemonkey ,
   
   I just rebased this PR. It seems that flaky tests failed again:` TransactionCleaningTest.txWithStoppedServer (Failed) ( concourse-ci/build-rhel-7-debug )`. I don't see connection between this case and this PR solution.
   
   Also it seems that one of my cases `testThatFunctionExecutionThrowsExceptionNonHAWithFilter` faild this time. I will check what could be the issue.

   Hi @pdxcodemonkey ,
   
   I just fixed my test cases in commit: https://github.com/apache/geode-native/pull/866/commits/0599097f0c062419edb27dd25e406cf53982acde . The problem was that rebalance operation was not triggered at all. Also, I improved the cases in a way that now rebalance is triggered after new server is introduced in cluster, as this works better for this case. I run them multiple times on my local machine and everything worked fine.

Commit fafa3be8f361bf696b0804f569b890826e242c7f in geode-native's branch refs/heads/develop from Jakov Varenina
[ https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=geode-native.git;h=fafa3be ]

GEODE-9591: Don't retry function when Function.isHA=false (#866)

* GEODE-9591: Don't retry function when Function.isHA=false

Fault:
Client clears result by calling ResultCollector::clearResult and
re-executes the function even thought Function.isHa() is set to false.

Fix:
Client will not clear result and retry the function, but it will fail with the
received exception from server.

Added integration test:
1.FunctionExecutionTest.testThatFunctionExecutionThrowsExceptionNonHAWithFilter
2.FunctionExecutionTest.testThatFunctionExecutionThrowsExceptionNonHA

The integration test reproduces the problem in a following way:

1. Populate region so that all buckets are created
2. Shutdown one of the three available servers
3. Peforme rebalance operation, so that buckets are recovered on running
servers
4. Execute the function. Function execution will fail with the
InternalFunctionInvocationTargetException exception, because client will
try to execute single hop function with old PR meatada information (PR
metadata received before the rebalance operation).

* ASSERT_THROW used instead of try-catch

* Check whether isHA==false before clearing results

It is possible that function exeuction fail on multiple servers, and in
that case only first exception will be thrown, and any subsequent
exeception will be ignored. Additionally result should not be cleared in
any case when isHa==false.

* Rebalance cmd was not executed

Test cases are changed to do rebalance operation
after new server is introduced in cluster.

* Client metadata wasn't complete when function is executed

Since client metadata was not complete the function was not exectued in
a single hop manner, and therfore exeption is not reproduced.

This commit is fixed in a way that now client is connected to only
one server. This way client metadata will be updated more frequently,
and client metadata will be complete when function is executed.

   @jvarenina Just want to mention here, in case it's important going forward:  The test `Apache.Geode.Client.UnitTests.ThinClientFunctionExecutionTests.OnServerHAExecuteFunctionTest` has failed on the Server 2019, VS 2019 release build job in CI (https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/teams/main/pipelines/geode-native-develop/jobs/build-windows-2019-vs-2019-release/builds/122).  It has passed on other Windows jobs (https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/teams/main/pipelines/geode-native-develop/jobs/build-windows-2016-vs-2017-release/builds/120 , e.g.), but failed first and then passed on retry.  This seems at least plausibly related to this PR, so it's worth keeping an eye on.

   @pdxcodemonkey Ok, I will keep eye on it. I have checked `OnServerHAExecuteFunctionTest` test case, and I couldn't find any connection to this PR solution. This PR only impacts function executions that have `Function.isHA` set to `false` (this flag is checked before all impact introduced in this PR), and `OnServerHAExecuteFunctionTest` has this parameter set to `true`. I will execute this failing case and check this in more details. Thank you pointing this out to me.
