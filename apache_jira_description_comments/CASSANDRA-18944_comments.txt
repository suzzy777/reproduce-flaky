simulator tests are run on ci-cassandra now, should be appearing.

I forgot to post this:

[https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2546/workflows/55061b41-7947-4f5d-b4d5-52dc004c0206]

I tried to reproduce also on 4.1, but it doesn't reproduce so it seems it is a 5.0 regression, unfortunately. 

On the other hand, in 4.1, the simulator tests are run on JDK8 only. The reported failing runs are on JDK11. There might be an issue with JDK11 that also exists on previous branches. (I haven't dug into the problem, so I am just giving points for thinking from experience for whoever assigns this ticket). If it turns out to be a Cassandra bug - we need to check the previous branches, too. 

One observation is that GossipShutdown is a new class recently added in CASSANDRA-18913.

We can see that the test is not failing with the previous commit from CASSANDRA-18889 - [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2567/workflows/47735581-a3dc-4a3c-9630-aaaaa2b5b0af]

And it is flaky with the next one from CASSANDRA-18913 -  [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2566/workflows/7eba589b-86ed-4c80-b8e1-f69b73beedc2/jobs/47340/tests]

 

[~dcapwell], [~brandonwilliams], can you take a look when you are back next week, please? 

I think this is a dup of CASSANDRA-19115

sorry not dup, but related problem.... I thought I fixed this bug struggling to find the patch... :cry:

ok I am not crazy... CASSANDRA-18952  should have fixed this issue

CASSANDRA-18952 merged Oct 30th so looking at the links I see the following that repo

 
 * [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2566/workflows/7eba589b-86ed-4c80-b8e1-f69b73beedc2/jobs/47340/tests]
 ** this points to [https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commits/18913], which doesn't have that fix; so rebasing should resolve that

 ** from before CASSANDRA-18952

 ** from before CASSANDRA-18952

 

So I think this issue is resolved

Thank you [~dcapwell].
For completeness, I started CI repeated run of the test, we can close the ticket on green CI:
5.0 - https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2590/workflows/47dedf52-87fd-4178-bc89-d179e58b6562
trunk - https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/2591/workflows/1150aab2-4961-4fe3-a126-b96356fdb939
I will check the runs tomorrow

The current reported problem seems to be solved. But it seems the test is flaky only on trunk with a new type of error. I will open a new ticket for that and bisect it properly there. Closing this one.
