This type of code factoring changes will make it harder for 89-fb/our internal branch changes to stay in sync with trunk; and to push/pull patches between the two revs. But agree that that can't be the reason to block all code factor/improvements. So those have to be evaluated on a case to case basis. Do we think these changes and code moves are worth it? [I have only looked at the specific changes superficially, but wanted to express the concern at least so that someone who has reviewed in detail can comment if this change is a must.]

I agree with Kannan that we should reduce the number of places where refactor is done to make porting easier.

Currently SplitLogManager.splitLogDistributed(final List<Path> logDirs) creates MonitoredTask to display status.
This results in repetitive display of the following form on 60010/master-status:
{code}
Doing distributed log split in [hdfs://...-splitting]
{code}
We should make log splitting status display cleaner.

@Kannan, I'm looking at this from the point of view of someone who recently spent a many hours reviewing the dist log splitting patches in aggregate and may be responsible for fixing issues if it has problems.  I had a harder time than I'd prefer, and will likely have the same problem again if there are problems in the future.  Doing a little bit of semantics preserving changes such as making var/method/class names more descriptive and encapsulating pieces would go a long way to make the code more easily and quickly understandable by more people.

Are you suggesting splitting these changes into smaller pieces such as:

* add better exception error messages.
* consolidate calls only used once. Ex: async callbacks submethods; inline finishInitailize into SLM's constructor
* rename vague methods. ex: installTask(String taskName) might be better as enqueueSplitLog(String logPath);  handleDeadWorker might be better as blacklistDeadWorker;  'exec(String name, Progressable)' might be better as  'split(String logfilename, Progressable)'
* rename vague classes. ex: Task to SplitTask, TaskBatch to SplitTaskState/SplitTaskContext
* correct comments to be consistent with code (comments in SplitLogWorker talks about SUCCESS state which acutally is DONE state).








I think Jon has a great point.  In porting this feature to CDH, I spent quite some time to understand it.

To Kannan's concern, the coding change for this Jira should be easy to back port since you already have the original change.

To someone else who doesn't have the original change, this Jira is supposed to make it easier to understand and port.

Can we meet in the middle with this patch? A few suggestions that would make the patch more trivial to review:
- don't do the whitespace-only fixes in parts of the code you're not touching
- don't expand out the "import foo.*"s
- don't move the callback code to different parts of the file
- *do* fix variable names to conform to style, remove dead code, add javadoc, rename classes, etc.

This should make the patch very easy to look over and make sure it doesn't break anything. It'll then be easy for FB to pull it into their branch if they want.

I'll commit this at the end of the day if there are no objections.

Committed to trunk (94) only, since 92 is already in an rc phase. We can backport this to 92 easily later if need be.
