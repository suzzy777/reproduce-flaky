The parquet timestamp timezone property is currently copied over into the JobConf in the FetchOperator, but this may be too late for some execution paths.
We should:
1 - copy the property over earlier
2 - set the default value on the JobConf if no property is set, and fail in the ParquetRecordReader if the property is missing from the JobConf

We should add extra validations for the cases when:
- the property was not set by accident on the JobConf (unexpected execution path)
- an incorrect/invalid timezone id is being set on the table
