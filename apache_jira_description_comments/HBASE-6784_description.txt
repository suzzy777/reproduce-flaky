The problem is not seen in jenkins build.  
When we run TestCoprocessorScanPolicy.testBaseCases locally or in our internal jenkins we tend to get random failures.  The reason is the 2 puts that we do here is sometimes getting the same timestamp.  This is leading to improper scan results as the version check tends to skip one of the row seeing the timestamp to be same. Marking this as minor.  As we are trying to solve testcase related failures just raising this incase we need to resolve this also.

For eg,
Both the puts are getting the time
{code}
time 1347635287360
time 1347635287360
{code}
