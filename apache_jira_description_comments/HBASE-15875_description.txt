I want to add a new AsyncTable implementation and to do that with great quality I want to run all the tests with a sync Table implementation which uses the AsyncTable within. To do this the HbaseTestingUtility has to return Table instead of HTable.

I saw this as the ideal opportunity to remove all deprecated HTableInterface methods in 2.0 branch and thus the interface itself. This means all auto flush settings are removed.

Some discussion points:
* I had to remove doBulkLoad(Path hfofDir, final HTable table) from LoadIncrementalHFiles because of the hard HTable usage and replaced usages to the other doBulkLoad(Path hfofDir, final Admin admin, Table table, RegionLocator regionLocator) method.
* HBaseTestingUtility now returns Table instead of HTable
* I removed all the methods from HConnection that were also in Connection + I removed the getTable methods which should not be used anymore. (HConnection is deprecated so could be removed itself)
