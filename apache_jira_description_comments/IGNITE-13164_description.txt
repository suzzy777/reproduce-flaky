Currently, each node id in thin client execute compute task request is written using 17 bytes (1 byte for type id and 16 bytes for UUID raw data). Since we don't need information about type id and node id can't be null we can write only UUID raw data as now implemented for service invoke request.

Compute functionality is not released yet, so format can be changed without compatibility issues.
