[~thejas] Would you like to take a look?

My suspicion is that HIVE-13349 is causing the problem. It is complaining about the derby initialization script and that is the only patch that changed it recently.
Also this test failed in the test run for the jira and has been seen since its commit. 
[~hsubramaniyan] can you please take a look ?

But there is one thing weird, it is failing for me even when I go back all the way to 22 nd March commits in master. Seems like something gets left behind .

[~thejas] your two comments are contradictory : ) HIVE-13349 can't make it fail on Mar 22 trunk. Further, I remember this test being flaky for a while now.

[~thejas] / [~ashutoshc] This seems to be because of a missing parenthesis in the init script introduced by my previous change. Its a very minor patch to review.

Thanks

Found out the reason why it was failing for me even with older commits. I had a $HOME/.beeline/beeline.properties file which was interfering with the test run!
Deleting that helped to get it working with older commits.

Tested the fix locally. This is a metastore script change and the entire unit tests are irrelevant. Will commit this fix into master.

Thanks
Hari

Committed to master, Thanks [~ashutoshc] for the review.
