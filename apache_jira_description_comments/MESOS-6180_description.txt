Following the merging of a large patch chain, it was noticed on our internal CI that several tests had become flaky, with a similar pattern in the failures: the tests fail early when a future times out. Often, this occurs when a test cluster is being spun up and one of the offer futures times out. This has been observed in the following tests:

* MesosContainerizerSlaveRecoveryTest.CGROUPS_ROOT_PidNamespaceForward
* MesosContainerizerSlaveRecoveryTest.CGROUPS_ROOT_PidNamespaceBackward
* ZooKeeperStateTest.FetchAndStoreAndStoreAndFetch
* RoleTest.ImplicitRoleRegister
* SlaveRecoveryTest/0.MultipleFrameworks
* SlaveRecoveryTest/0.ReconcileShutdownFramework
* SlaveTest.ContainerizerUsageFailure
* MesosSchedulerDriverTest.ExplicitAcknowledgements
* SlaveRecoveryTest/0.ReconnectHTTPExecutor (MESOS-6164)
* ResourceOffersTest.ResourcesGetReofferedAfterTaskInfoError (MESOS-6165)
* SlaveTest.CommandTaskWithKillPolicy (MESOS-6166)

See the linked JIRAs noted above for individual tickets addressing a couple of these.
