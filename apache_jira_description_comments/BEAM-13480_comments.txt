Is this a new failure?

It seems that this test is failing only some of the time: 
https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Python38/2047/#showFailuresLink (fails)
https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Python38/2048/#showFailuresLink (doesn't fail or at least the failure is not reported)

Yeah, it appears to be a flaky test. Slip up on terminology was misleading :)Â 

This has been sickbayed until investigation is complete.

This Jira ticket has a pull request attached to it, but is still open. Did the pull request resolve the issue? If so, could you please mark it resolved? This will help the project have a clear view of its open issues.

The issue has not been fully resolved. We merged [PR16255|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16255] to skip the flaky test while we investigate the issue. I've downgraded it to P2 for now.

Increased timeout to fix this issue.

Still happening:

We added some capabilities to see more detailed error messages here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-14439, and are looking forward to seeing this error again the next time it fails.
