The problem seems to be that a prompt didn't appear as expected. 

The only relevant change recently is IMPALA-5269.

I've been looping the test for a bit and I haven't been able to reproduce yet.

In the case when it failed, it looks like the server never executes the previous statement. There is a 30 second gap between queries from the previous test and queries from the following test during which no Impalad receives a query.
{noformat}
I0222 03:23:46.618664  3375 Frontend.java:914] Compiling query: drop database if exists foo
I0222 03:23:46.618916  3375 Frontend.java:953] Compiled query.
I0222 03:23:46.623113  3375 impala-server.cc:1389] Waiting for catalog version: 36784 current version: 36782
I0222 03:23:47.741624  3869 impala-server.cc:1363] Catalog topic update applied with version: 36784 new min catalog object version: 35648
I0222 03:23:47.743669  3375 impala-server.cc:1399] Received catalog version: 36784
{noformat}

Weirdly (?) on a successful run I'm seeing two of the queries get combined by the shell, which doesn't seem like it was the intent of the test:
{noformat}
I0223 17:34:53.343468 23313 impala-beeswax-server.cc:52] query(): query=select 1--comment;
select /*comment*/
1
I0223 17:34:53.343468 23313 impala-beeswax-server.cc:52] query(): query=select 1--comment;
select /*comment*/
1
{noformat}

I confirmed just confirmed that with IMPALA-5269 reverted, three separate sql statements get sent to the server.

IMPALA-6582: fix test_multiline_queries_in_history

The semicolon was in the wrong place in one of the test queries and
the failure was swallowed silently.

This meant that one fewer prompt was displayed than expected. This
didn't cause a test failure because the prompt regex also matched the
"Connected to host:port" message printed in the shell preamble. I'm
unsure why this would cause the test failure but my best theory is that
in the failure case, the "Connected" and prompt messages are both
buffered when we evaluate the first prompt regex, and the regex swallows
up the whole input, rather than just the first instance.

Testing:
Tightened up the prompt regex and checked that the query actually
executed successfully. With these improvements, the broken query
text caused a test failure.

I looped the test for a while to make sure it was robust.

Added a couple of related test cases to make sure we aren't losing
coverage.

It looks like this happened again.

Let's not reopen this issue unless it's clear that it's the same root cause.
