[~markflyhigh] has some experience with {{multiprocess}} flag.

Why are tests flaky? Is it because we use temporary files etc. that are overlapping across tests?

It's not immediately obvious where the bug is (our tests or multiprocess), hence this JIRA issue.

Integration tests in PostCommit are enabled with miltiprocess. AFAIK, the machine that host jenkins instance has 4 cores, so I think set processes=4 should be fine.

Closing this, as I'm in favor of migrating to pytest instead. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3713)
