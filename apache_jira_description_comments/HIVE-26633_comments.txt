I've added a WIP patch that makes it configurable via HiveConf and JdbcConf.
https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/3674

One issue is that there seems to be no way to provide a different TConfiguration object for SSL connections.
Hive uses https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/9207b28b7df5f8e01960154971e8de07094c91a8/lib/java/src/main/java/org/apache/thrift/transport/TSSLTransportFactory.java#L290
which does a "new TSocket(socket)".
https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/9207b28b7df5f8e01960154971e8de07094c91a8/lib/java/src/main/java/org/apache/thrift/transport/TSocket.java#L58

I have not had a chance to test with SSL enabled. I will try to get that done. We may need follow up work for this.

Another interesting observation - this enforcement doesn't get hit without SASL and/maybe SSL enabled. I would expect the limit by Thrift to be enforced unilaterally.


Merged into master. Thank you [~jfs] for the contribution and [~amansinha] for the review!

Thanks [~dengzh]!

Looping around to add some more detail to the JIRA (just in case someone runs across this issue).
This patch added "hive.thrift.client.max.message.size" to make the limit configurable for both SSL and SASL (there was concerns in my last comment I wouldn't be able to fix SSL paths, but the patch was re-worked to fix those paths too).
I picked a larger default of 1gb vs 100mb internal thrift default, so hopefully very few installations would need to ever adjust the above setting.

The ticket is marked as resolved for 4.0.0 but we are currently underway of releasing 4.0.0-alpha-2 so I changed the fixVersion accordingly; If that is not accurate please update the fixVersion accordingly.
