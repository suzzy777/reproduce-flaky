If {{V1JobsServlet}} DEBUG level logging is turned on and {{tryCreateOnDFS}} catches an exception and tried to log the details, only the following is printed to the log:
{noformat}
Could not write XML [%s] to HDFS. Error message: %s
{noformat}
Instead of {{%s}} we should use {{\{0\}}} and {{\{1\}}} to get a meaningful error message. Or we should use {{String.format}}
