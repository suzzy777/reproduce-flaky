KUDU-3237 fix MaintenanceManagerTest.TestCompletedOpsHistory

This patch fixes a flakiness in the TestCompletedOpsHistory scenario.
The flakiness is a test-only issue which became apparent as a result of
the recent changes introduced into the MaintenanceManager with 9e4664d44
changelist.  In essence, with finer granularity of locking in the
scoped cleanup of the MaintenanceManager::LaunchOp() method, the test
thread calling MaintenanceManager::GetMaintenanceManagerStatusDump()
has a slight chance of acquiring 'completed_ops_lock_' ahead of the
thread executing the code in the LaunchOp()'s scoped cleanup.

This patch wraps the related code into ASSERT_EVENTUALLY to resolve
test-only race condition mentioned above.  I verified that this patch
fixes the issue by running the test scenario multiple times under
dist-test (RELEASE build).
