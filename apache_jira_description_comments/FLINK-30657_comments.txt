Quoting what I commented on in FLINK-30413:
{quote}[...] I realize that this very test that popped up as documented in my previous comment, should actually be disabled already. That's something we might have to look into as part of FLINK-30657. Thanks for taking care of it.

[~mapohl] Thanks for notify. I have seem that these codes are already disabled, so I change the title to remove them.

[~mapohl] Can you help me review these three PR?

While investigating why a disabled test as mentioned in [my previous comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-30657?focusedCommentId=17676524&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17676524] failed, I noticed that I overlooked the spelling of the test. Not the already disabled {{PulsarUnorderedPartitionSplitReaderTest}} is unstable but the corresponding {{PulsarOrderedPartitionSplitReaderTest}}. I created FLINK-30703 to document this.

Thanks. I'll check that issue.

I've downgraded this ticket from a Blocker to Critical, given that I don't think this should block the Flink 1.16.1 release. 

flink-connector-pulsar 3.0 via https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-pulsar/pull/17

I'm not sure whether we should backport to 1.15 and 1.16.

Considering that the still open test instability is covered by FLINK-30703 and the other tests are already disabled in 1.15 and 1.16, backporting the removal might not be necessary.

I'm closing this issue
