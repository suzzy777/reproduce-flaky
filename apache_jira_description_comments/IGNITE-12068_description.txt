select using the first primary key only returns one record, but it should return more records.
The following is how to reproduce this problem

1, create a table using
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Person(
 id int,
 city_id int,
 name varchar,
 age int, 
 company varchar,
 PRIMARY KEY (id, city_id)
);
2, insert some records
INSERT INTO Person (id, name, city_id) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 3);
INSERT INTO Person (id, name, city_id) VALUES (1, 'John Dean', 4);
INSERT INTO Person (id, name, city_id) VALUES (2, 'Alex', 4);
3, query using 'select * from Person' show all of the records, expected

4, query using 'select * from Person where id=1', only get one record, NOT expected

5, query using 'select * from Person where city_id=4' get  two records, expected

Why  'select * from Person where id=1', only get one record? and how to fix this? Is there any special operations/configurations to do?
