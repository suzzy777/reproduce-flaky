Seems to me like a timing issue that I easily reproduced locally by reducing the timeout given to 

_advance_to_next_cl_segment_ method. I. will experiment in CircleCI a bit

1000 times successful finish on [4.0|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=17889-4.0], 

500 times successful completion on [4.1|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra?branch=17889-4.1]

I opted out from running it on other branches so far as it seems obvious to me that these days Jenkins was lagging a lot. We didn't have 3.0 and 3.11 builds since 26th August but on all other branches we see the timeout these days. 

I suggest we raise the timeout provided to _advance_to_next_cl_segment_ method in _snapshot_test_ to 180 and rerun in a loop the whole snapshot_test class on all branches? [~adelapena], does this sound reasonable to you? 

 

It sounds very reasonable to me.

By the way, it seems there's a mistake in [the way the error message is formatted|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/trunk/tools/hacks.py#L60]:
{noformat}
AssertionError: It's been over a {s}s and we haven't written a new commitlog segment. Something is wrong.
{noformat}
I think we should use:
{code:python}
("It's been over {s}s and we haven't written a new "
 "commitlog segment. Something is wrong.").format(s=timeout)
{code}

Yeah, I also noticed it, I will fix It with the timeout raise and then run all branches with the patch soon. Thanks

I ended up changing the default timeout for the _advance_to_next_cl_segment_ to 180 [here|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra-dtest/commit/9034106e2be4844f41ba310c4320ba0e5f2463e4]{_}.{_} I noticed last time in 2018 it was taken the same approach and it makes sense that it will probably start lagging soon in the other cdc_test too. 

Ran below jobs 300 times.

Looking into older tickets there were differences between code and time to run those tests for 3.0, 3.11, 4.0 so I ran on all branches. I don't think trunk has diverged a lot there from 4.1 so I decided to save resources on that one. 

 

Looks good to me, +1

Committed, thanks!
