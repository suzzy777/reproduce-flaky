[~gezapeti] can you please review? Thanks!

The patch looks good in general. There is a star import in it, please fix that.
Are there any guaranties that these entries are not coming back again?

Thanks [~gezapeti] for the review!

Unfortunately there is no such guarantee, this change only removes stale {{SLACalculatorMemory#slaMap}} entries after a preconfigured number of retries.

To have such guarantees, we have to:
* [*remove deprecated {{SLAEventBean}}*|OOZIE-2364] along w/ any logic in favor of {{SLARegistrationBean}} and {{SLASummaryBean}}. 
* [*refactor {{SLACalculatorMemory}}*|OOZIE-3276]:
** to have {{slaMap}} be consistent w/ basic workflow, coordinator, or bundle entries anytime, meaning in case these haven't been persisted yet or have already been deleted, no SLA update should be performed
** rework also the public interfaces of {{SLACalculator}} not to have {{slaMap}} or {{historySet}} exposed to outside world
** modify {{SLACalculatorMemory}} to have {{slaMap}} and {{historySet}} updates in parallel
