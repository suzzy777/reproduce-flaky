[~jensg] I am thinking of a mode for the cross test stage called "prove" which would be executed before "merge" and would run all disabled tests many times (32? 64?) in a row to make sure they are not flaky.  If it is proved to be reliable then it gets re-enabled.  So the workflow would be:

test.py --update-expected-failures=prove # prove any disabled tests can be enabled, and do so
test/py --update-expected-failures=merge # merge in the re-enabled tests

Thoughts?

I just noticed that "make fail" re-runs all tests and then overwrites, not merges, the exclusions file.  Should we change that to merge?

@[~nsuke], I guess you have more knowledge about this that I will ever have ;-)
