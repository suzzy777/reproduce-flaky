Hi [~gaborgsomogyi] [~gyfora] , I am using the Flink k8s opeartor in production environment during work and want to learn and contribute to the Flink k8s operator. Can I take this task as the starter?

Of course, go ahead:)

Happy to see contributors :)

Hi [~gyfora] [~gaborgsomogyi], I added the code to print init container log, tested locally and opened a draft MR to trigger Github CI. However, it is said that {{First-time contributors need a maintainer to approve running workflows}}. Could you please help approve? Thanks!

The e2e [error|https://github.com/apache/flink-kubernetes-operator/actions/runs/4147827390/jobs/7175460340#step:9:1340] in busybox init container is {_}wget: error getting response: Connection reset by peer{_}. It looks like similar error is already reported as an [issue|https://github.com/docker-library/busybox/issues/162].Â 
I pushed another commit to downgrade from 1.36.0 to 1.35.0 but the workflow run still needs approval.

merged to main 02bef3d69acc03add5c8e0970aa59b85278965dc
