Fixed in [f48393ce2|https://github.com/apache/calcite/commit/f48393ce24ba931ac3e3f3c9e942a60189eda81d]; thanks for the PR, [~adayal]!

Hi [~julianhyde] - thanks for helping with the PR and merging it in.

I see the snapshot build failed and the failure is around FMPP. I'm trying to understand the error, what can I do to help with this?

I'm pulling from HEAD and going to see if I can reproduce the issue.

I did a fresh clone and ran:
{quote}./gradlew "-Dorg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m" -Pasf=true -PCI=true --no-build-cache --profile --no-daemon build
{quote}
And got a success. Did this twice.

Is there a docker image or VM used by the build node I can use to try to reproduce the issue?

Hmmm I see the next snapshot build succeeded with an unrelated change.

I would chalk this up to test flakiness. I ran the whole CI suite successfully before I merged your change.

Resolved in release 1.35.0 (2023-07-26)
