    Test failure looks quite strange
    
    ```

    No output has been received in the last 10 minutes, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.
    
    The build has been terminated
    ```
    
    @prasadwagle could you please close and re-opening the PR again to trigger a CI and see if this deserves a JIRA issue with `flaky-test` label?

    This PR does not update note title in the menu and main page, when title is changed.
    Try change note title and see list of note in the menu and main page.
    
    I think broadcastNoteList need to be called when note title is updated.
