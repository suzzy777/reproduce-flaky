Still investigating the cause ... FWIW, this seed always results in one or more failing tests:

SOLR-11912: Improve TriggerIntegrationTest to avoid side-effects between tests (spurious autoscaling events).
Add a convenience method to DistribStateManager to remove data recursively.

So far as I was able to determine the most common reason for these failures were side-effects of other tests in the suite - namely, trigger configurations used in a previous test would keep generating events even after the next test was started, producing unexpected events, actions and cooldowns (waiting the cooldown period and pausing triggers that were to be tested in the current test).

These side-effects were time-sensitive, and depended on thread contention in the JVM that executed the test suite (and other suites) - basically, stopping trigger threads took longer than the interval between finishing and starting the next test in the suite.

Reopen if this issue occurs again.

This test keeps failing very frequently in Jenkins

Resolving - I haven't seen these failures for a while now. Please reopen if it starts failing again.
