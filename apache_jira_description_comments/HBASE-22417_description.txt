DeleteTableProcedure defines a static deleteFromMeta method that's currently used both by DeleteTableProcedure itself and TruncateTableProcedure. Sometimes, depending on the table size (and under slower, under performing FileSystems), truncation can take longer to complete *TRUNCATE_TABLE_CLEAR_FS_LAYOUT* stage, but the given table has already been deleted from meta on previous *TRUNCATE_TABLE_REMOVE_FROM_META* stage. In this case, features relying on Master's table descriptor's cache might wrongly try to reference this truncating table. Master Web UI, for example, would try to check this table state and end up showing a 500 error.
