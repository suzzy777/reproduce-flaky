When <name-node> element in Oozie workflow specifies a name node different from the default one (specified in core-site.xml), the following functionality doesnâ€™t work properly:
- Location of libraries specified via oozie.service.WorkflowAppService.system.libpath. Oozie first (during launcher configuration) tries to locate them using name node specified by the <name-node> element, but later during job submission it expects this path to be under the default Oozie name node 
- Processing of the job-xml element if job xml is specified via absolute path. Oozie tries locate it under the default Oozie name node instead of the name-node specified in action.

Specifying non-default name node makes a lot of sense in Azure environment, because it allows to submit the same job to different Hadoop clusters.

I will submit a fix for CR soon. Please refer attached short document for more information.
