looking into it

bq. property test did not complete within PT1M

this is just a timeout issue, the same seed passes but looks like it just took too long in CI.  Ill bump the timeout and run again...

Thought we ran repeat tests before merging, will look into that

ok, looks like repeat tests were not run... my script for CI probably broke when we dropped jdk8... ill look into this

I know the fix for this, but wanted to first make sure I can repo.  I fixed my script to work with jdk17 and _repeat jobs again; running here https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra?branch=deleteme

latest run had 2 failures and only on jdk17... I reran the seed + config + jdk17 and the test takes 12s locally (M1 Mac)... Ill look into this more Monday
