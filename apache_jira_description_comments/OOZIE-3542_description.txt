Currently, ECPolicyDisabler checks if the local hdfs implementation has the necessary methods to get and set erasure coding policy. However, if the namenode implementation is old, it could throw a org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException with RpcErrorCodeProto.ERROR_NO_SUCH_METHOD value in it.
In this case, ECPolicyDisabler fails, and prevents the installation to succeed.

This case should be handled just like, when erasure coding is not supported.
