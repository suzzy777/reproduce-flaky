As the [FLINK-30413|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-30413] issue talked, we have dropped the Shared and Key_Shared supported in upcoming flink-connector-pulsar 4.0 release. The flaky tests of Shared and Key_Shared still matters the old Flink build.

Cause these tests are useless now, we can just disable them without any fix.
