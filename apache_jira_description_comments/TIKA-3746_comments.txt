I copied/pasted and modified the unit tests in 2.x to 1.x.  One of the challenges with 1.x is that the forked process is not quite as responsive as in 2.x.   In 2.x, the forked process has a thread that reads from the stdout of the forking process, and if that connection goes down, the forked process terminates immediately(ish).  In 1.x, the forked process reads from the shared tmp/status file and/or checks the forking process's stdout on a "ping" schedule.

 

The updated unit tests rely on forking processes instead of threads and set a very fast ping rate for the forked process (50 ms).
