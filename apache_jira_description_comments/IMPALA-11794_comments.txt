I can reproduce the issue by carefully control the start time of these two tests:
{code:bash}
impala-py.test tests/metadata/test_load.py::TestLoadData & sleep 40; impala-py.test tests/metadata/test_load.py::TestLoadDataExternal {code}

Commit 9951dc166aadc77a96cc8c1fda140dad5e452234 in impala's branch refs/heads/master from stiga-huang

IMPALA-11794: Fix flakiness of TestLoadDataExternal.test_load by using dedicated table name

IMPALA-11736 adds TestLoadDataExternal that uses the same table name
used by an existing test (TestLoadData). These two tests both will clean
up the test tables at the beginning and at the end. If they run
concurrently, one of them will fail. Note that e2e tests are ran in
parallel by default.

This patch fixes TestLoadDataExternal to use a dedicated table name.

Tests:
