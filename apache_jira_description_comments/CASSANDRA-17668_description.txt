This is a continuation of CASSANDRA-17638 where we fixed leaks introduced during development of 4.1 to ensure no regressions.

This ticket is to fix a few leakages which are there since previous major versions, not 4.1 regressions. 

{_}setRepairSessionMaxTreeDepth{_}(exists since 3.0) and _setRepairSessionSpaceInMegabytes(since 4.0)_

 in the DatabaseDescriptor. 

checkValidForByteConversion and _validateMaxConcurrentAutoUpgradeTasksConf (both since 4.0)_

 are used in both setters and on startup. They shouldn't throw ConfigurationException in the setters. 

There might be more but those are at least a few obvious I found in the DatabaseDescriptor.
