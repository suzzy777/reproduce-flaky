    Where does the "--type uds" option get passed into the python test client or server in order to convince it to use domain sockets?  In other test suites like cpp, only "--domain_socket" is required in order to force it to use "domain".

    You added domain tests to the haskell group, not the nodejs group.

    The presence of "--domain-socket" to the client or server implies uds.  This needs to be fixed, and domain needs to be moved from haskell to nodejs, and the cross tests that are failing (many) in the ubuntu-artful docker image need to be investigated.  For example it is likely expected for the "http-domain" subset of tests to fail given the http-ip ones fail already, however in one test I found that the call to fs.unlinkSync(path)  [server.js] failed because the domain socket doesn't exist before the test begins, and this call throws an exception, causing it to fail.

    If you haven't seen it I recommend reading `build/docker/README.md` and use the `ubuntu-artful` image to run a cross test with `build/docker/scripts/cross-test.sh` inside the docker container.  Doing this effectively runs the same build as travis would (job #1 which is the cross test).  You can run only the nodejs tests with domain sockets by running the command `test/test.py --regex '.*nodejs.*domain.*'` after completing cross-test.sh.

    Please rebase on master one more time, most of the build issues are gone now.

    I believe the unexpected failures from the latest run is not related to my changes for nodejs.
    
    Maybe it needs another merge from master branch?

    Perhaps; my PR for THRIFT-4515 improves the stability and coverage of crosstest by adding more controlled server shutdown, and it passed tests (I've run it many times on my local fork as well).  I just merged it into master, so if you want to squash to a single commit and rebase, let's give it a try.


Github user jeking3 commented on the issue:

    I am running a cross test on this locally; if it passes I will merge it, so don't take any action.


Github user jeking3 commented on the issue:

    I get an error that may be unrelated when I run cross tests on --server nodejs locally.  This one test failes sporadically and I don't know if it could be related to these changes; the client has to be killed in this scenario, I don't know if it is because the server is unresponsive or not.  I may just disable this one test for the merge.

    Okay so, here's the deal.  This pull request has 9 commits and one of them is a merge.  If you want your name on the commit tag you will need to squash and resubmit with a single commit and then I can cherry-pick it over and push it.  Otherwise if you don't care, I can squash and merge it, but my name will end up in the "Author" field of the commit, and I will include your name in the content of the pull request, i.e.:
    
    ```

        Client: nodejs
        
        This closes #1491
    ```
    Let me know what you want to do.  I'm fine either way.

    This squash was not done properly.  It includes all of the master commits in it.
    
    You want to start with an updated master:
    
    git checkout master
    git pull
    
    Then you want to branch:
    git checkout -b THRIFT-4489-squashed
    
    Then you want to merge with squash, pulling anything in uds-nodejs over to THRIFT-4489-squashed
    git merge --squash uds-nodejs
    
    Then commit and add your description for your changes.
    Then push that branch and let me know when it is in your fork, and I will pull it and merge it.  No need to update this PR or open a new one.
