Ignite Start Nodes suite contains several flaky tests.
Example runs with sporadic fails: 
1) http://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=746188&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=Ignite20Tests_IgniteStartNodes
2) http://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=747364&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=Ignite20Tests_IgniteStartNodes
The ticket is for investigation and making tests stable.
