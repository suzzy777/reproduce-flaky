There is a deadlock in concurrent cron job execution with release resource option.

Scenario:
 Two notebook run with cron job that release resource after job finished.
 
  In Notebook.CronJob.execute() method:
  T1. note.runAll(); // locked paragraphs(lock) and wait to interpreterSettings(lock)

  T2. notebook.getInterpreterFactory().restart()   //locked(interpreterSettings) and wait for paragraphs(lock) during jobAbort.

  This will trigger a deadlock that cause zeppelin hang.
