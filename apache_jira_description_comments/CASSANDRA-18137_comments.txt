Just opened https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-18699 which might be worth including in this effort?

I think it might be the last step to do in this epic: we can consider moving {{{}finish_release.sh{}}}, {{prepare_release.sh}} scripts to the Cassandra project so that we can build a release from the branch we want to release.
