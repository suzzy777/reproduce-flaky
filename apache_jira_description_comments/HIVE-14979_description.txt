HiveServer2 could use Zookeeper to store token that indicate that particular tables are locked with the creation of persistent Zookeeper objects. 
A problem can occur when a HiveServer2 instance creates a lock on a table and the HiveServer2 instances crashes ("Out of Memory" for example) and the locks are not released in Zookeeper. This lock will then remain until it is manually cleared by an admin.

There should be a way to remove stale locks at HiveServer2 initialization, helping the admins life.
