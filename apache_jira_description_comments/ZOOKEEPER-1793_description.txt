not sure if this is due to a known issue or not.

// check and make sure the change is persisted
zkDb2 = new ZKDatabase(new FileTxnSnapLog(logDir, snapDir));
lastZxid = zkDb2.loadDataBase();
Assert.assertEquals("data2", new String(zkDb2.getData("/foo", stat, null)));

this assert periodically (once every 3 runs of the test or so) fails saying that  getData returns data1 and not data2.
