I've asked in INFRA-16380 about machine specs and performance characteristics of the build. Once I hear back I'll work on tuning Gradle's parameters.

Probably the main option to tune is the number of Gradle workers. I believe Gradle allocates workers according to number of CPU cores, and each one has 1GB or memory space.

I believe [~jasonkuster] mentioned these are [n1-standard-4|https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types] machines, which means that each one has 15 GB of memory.

With the high-mem machines now provisioned, our tests are much more reliable. I'm going to consider this done.
