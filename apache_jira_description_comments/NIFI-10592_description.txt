The tests below were found flaky because of the use of HashMaps and HashSet. The orders of elements in the HashMaps and HashSet are not the same every time being called. In this case, LinkedHashMap and LinkedHashSet is applied to replace Hash in order to ensure the orders are not changing.Â 

*org.apache.nifi.reporting.prometheus.TestPrometheusRecordSink.testSendData*

*org.apache.nifi.reporting.azure.loganalytics.TestAzureLogAnalyticsProvenanceReportingTask.testAddField2*

*org.apache.nifi.distributed.cache.server.map.DistributedMapCacheTest.testSubMap*

It matters to fix this flaky test as it may cause potential issues due to the uncertainty of orders from HashMaps and HashSet rather than the program itself.
