[~alex.behm] Is this something you have the time to look at? If you do and feel that it's not a real issue, feel free to downgrade.

[~sailesh], sure! Assigning to myself.

My current best guess is that this issue is due to IMPALA-5087/IMPALA-6386.

[~joemcdonnell], do you agree that this issue could be due to IMPALA-6386? Looks like this particular TPCDS table is missing one partition.

[~alex.behm] It does sound like a dataload problem. I'm a bit unsure that it could be IMPALA-6386. All the work for this is happening in Hive.

tpcds_seq_snap.store_sales (and other versions of store_sales) do the "CREATE TABLE" in Impala, but we don't explicitly add partitions in Impala. All the population of partitions is done via Hive statements with dynamic partitionning. I'm taking a look at the dataload logs.

[~alex.behm] Parsing through the logs, tpcds.store_sales shows populating partition ss_sold_date_sk=2451661 while tpcds_seq_snap.store_sales does not (even though it is populated by selecting from tpcds.store_sales).

[~joemcdonnell], thanks for checking. That's strange indeed. Did you notice a similar discrepancy when loading other dependent tables of tpcds.store_sales? I'm wondering  if the partition go lost in "tpcds.store_sales" or whether somehow it did not get picked up in the dynamic partition portion of the INSERT.

[~alex.behm] TPC-DS only does three formats: text, sequence snappy, and parquet. tpcds.store_sales seems to have that partition (2451661) based on the Hive printout from inserting into that table. I checked the Impala output for the parquet version, and that one also seems to have the 2451661 partition (it is selecting from the text version). Only the sequence snappy version seems to be missing it, even though it is selecting from the text version that has it.

Very strange.

Both Joe and I looked this and it appears that Hive just did not create that partition although the partition exists in the source table. There's not much to go on here, no errors in the logs or similar, just a mysteriously disappeared partition. Hive even correctly reports which partitions were created (one was missing). Subsequent runs of the same job have since succeeded.

Going to resolve this for now to reflect reality. Hopefully  hoping new information will pop up eventually.
