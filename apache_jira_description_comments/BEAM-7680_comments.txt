Kasia, would you be able to look at this issue?

Feel free to assign back to me if you don't have the bandwidth, but it would be great if you could check : )

Sure [~pabloem] : )

Do you know if there is particular reason why we assumed to have 3 seconds as an upper bound? It isn't documented in the code. I think it's difficult to assume there is top limit because we are depending on currently available resources. In case machine is busy probably runtime will extend and the test will be flaky. Maybe it would be good to get rid of upper limit?

[~chamikara] you're mentioned in the TODOs, WDYT?

Sorry, this is from code I wrote several years back and I lost context.

I think comment was about test being time based on general (and hence there's a possibility of flakes).
