Failing tests are known to be flaky https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15169

Hi [~ngangam] Can you please review?

[~spena] [~stakiar] Can you also take a look? I tested these scripts using the {{metastore-upgrade-test.sh}} for postgres, mysql and derby databases as well. The tool currently does not support Oracle and MSSQL databases. I am looking into how can I test on those databases as well.

There was a filename conflict after I rebased to latest code. Modified the file names accordingly

Manually tested against an Oracle database as metastore and fixed some errors in the Oracle scripts

Just the schema changes look good to me. So +1 for me on the changes. what jira will have code that accesses this table? The HMS APIs, the JDO mapping changes and others. Please CC me on that jira as well. Thanks



Thanks for the review [~ngangam]. The patch which has the code changes is another sub-task of the parent JIRA. That patch is available for review on HIVE-16555. I have added you to its review board as well.

Fix has been pushed to master. Thank you for your contributions [~vihangk1]

Thanks for the review [~ngangam]

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
