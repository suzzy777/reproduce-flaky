Here is a preview of how the workflows would look like for trunk:

I still have do some fixes, prepare the patches for 4.0 and 4.1 and properly test it.

The UI seems to cover everything.

Shall we make the trie unit tests mandatory at least for jdk8 until they are added also in Jenkins? Same as we did for keyspaces? Or do you want to do it in a separate ticket or run it through the ML?

I'm also adding the missing CDC unit tests, since doing it here doesn't require too much extra effort:

Not sure:
 # If we make them mandatory here. If CASSANDRA-17987 gets merged after this, we'll need another ticket to make them not mandatory again. That's not ideal given the time and money required to test this kind of patches.
 # We could block this ticket until CASSANDRA-17987 gets merged, but that will leave us without a way of running trie tests with Java 11 in the mean time.
 # We could commit this in what is expected to be its final state and hope that CASSANDRA-17987 gets merged soon, which seems likely.

In any case, note that the utests-trie job is mostly a just-in-case config, and tries have their own tests that are run with the regular config.

I agree with everything you said. Let's not do it mandatory. Now we have an initiative and short-term focus and I also expect CASSANDRA-17987 to be worked on sooner than later. The keyspaces one were not a priority and their Jenkins ticket was opened more than 1 year ago. They got broken 2 times and we did them mandatory until someone find circles to finally add them in Jenkins so they do not regress anymore.

Thanks for doing it! I just checked we run cdc also with 3.11. I guess we will have to add them there too. 

I think you missed the keyspaces ones in the JDK11 pre-commit workflow. I didn't find anything else suspicious in the UI :)

I noticed the trunk PR, you wanted to start from it as previous branches will be actually less jobs I guess. I can take a look into the code tomorrow

That is sthg I was wondering about a few days ago. +1 to what you guys said and the PR. But you keep referring in your conversations to CASSANDRA-17987 as if it were some other ticket when it's this one in fact. What am I missing?

We meant CASSANDRA-17989.

Good thx!

Agree, I've left it as not mandatory.

Good catch, I have added them ([workflow|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2319/workflows/017df4a7-4cb0-41c6-81e9-a22ebdb29761]).
{quote}I just checked we run cdc also with 3.11. I guess we will have to add them there too. 
{quote}
Yep, I'll prepare a patch for 3.11.

I'll post the patches for the rest of the branches in a bit, they are almost ready.

Here are the patches for all brances, with the default lowres:

If it looks good I'll prepare runs for mid and high.

3.11 looks OK to me. I haven't realized you removed the repeated jobs from UI if they haven't been set to test. That cleans the UI significantly :) 4.0 and 4.1 are the same. trunk adds also tries. They all look fine to me. It is already late, I can verify the higher resources tomorrow that nothing shifted while creating new patches.

 

My God that is a lot of config file crunching! Do you have an example with repeatable tests just to doublecheck they come up ok? I remember some funnies when repeatable were added so just to be on the safe side.

Here are the runs for the three resource configs and for the multiplexer:

Sorry if I am missing it bc reading so many circle workflow screens makes me dizzy lol. Are upgrade dtests repeat missing?

[~bereng] In what branch are they missing? Note that the {{generate.sh}} script deletes the jobs without tests to be repeated, [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/.circleci/generate.sh#L283-L294], and there aren't upgrade tests for j11.

On the trunk [multiplexer|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra?branch=17987-trunk-multiplexer] separate tests i.e. You seem to have '_repeat' variations for everything else except upgrade dtests. If that is a consequence of the deletion of the job bc no upgrade tests are present then that is ok.

Ah, Python dtests. I haven't specified anything on {{REPEATED_DTESTS}} nor {{REPEATED_UPGRADE_DTESTS}} because this is about unit tests and the command for repeating Ant targets. Python dtests use other command and don't have automatic detection.

Yep good. Just wanted to confirm they hadn't fell through the cracks

[~e.dimitrova]'s eagle eye has detected that the repeated runs for some specialized tests aren't actually running the tests. That's because of a mistake while initializating the {{target}} var in the {{run_repeated_utests}} command. That makes the Ant targets that are not of the form "testsome" receive qualified class names, while they are expecting short class names. So the job doesn't find the tests.

Also, the command was also ignoring the {{testtag}} attribute used by the Ant's test macro to group the test results and logs. That produces problems while collecting the run artifacts.

These bugs were introduced during CASSANDRA-17939, and I think we should fix them here to get the specialized unit tests ready. I have added fixes for both things, also including 3.0:

Sorry, It's 10pm already and my brain is frying already, I will check those tomorrow morning first thing. 

I briefly looked the 3.0 patch and it looked fine to me

Sure, no worries, and thanks for the deep review. These multibranch patches of patches with diffs of diffs can melt anyone's brain :)

{quote}diffs of diffs
{quote}
:D my favorite

3.0 - do we need also to recreate again the patches? I didn't test but I suspect we will be getting again those warnings, no?

CI-wise - 4.0 caught a flaky test, 4.1 needs another push of the unit tests as it seems you hit env issue. I hit the same yesterday.I am sure simple rerun will fix it.

I tried to verify also that nothing shifted with MIDRES and HIGHRES with the patching on all branches. 

Overall I am +1 here, thank you for tackling this

We do not, they still apply cleanly without warnings.

I'll open a ticket for that one.

Thanks for that, I know that's tedious work.

Assuming that last run looks good do, I think we'll be ready to commit if [~bereng] is also ok with the changes.

The last run for 4.1 looks good to me.

+1 on everything said and the runs, etc, thanks :) 

Apologies for the late reply I have been OOO. +1 from me.
