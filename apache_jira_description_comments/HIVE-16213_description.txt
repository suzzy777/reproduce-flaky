In ObjectStore.java there are a few places with the code similar to:

{code}
    Query query = null;
    try {
      openTransaction();
      query = pm.newQuery(Something.class);
      ...
      commited = commitTransaction();
    } finally {
      if (!commited) {
        rollbackTransaction();
      }
      if (query != null) {
        query.closeAll();
      }
    }
{code}

The problem is that rollbackTransaction() may throw an exception in which case query.closeAll() wouldn't be executed. 

The fix would be to wrap rollbackTransaction in its own try-catch block.
