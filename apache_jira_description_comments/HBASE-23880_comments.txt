This doesn't seem to have helped.  Build #5526 is the one that added the patch but a test in it failed with the same old:
{code}
Error Message

unable to create new native thread

Stacktrace

java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread
	at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestRegionReplicaFailover.verifyNumericRowsWithTimeout(TestRegionReplicaFailover.java:204)
	at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestRegionReplicaFailover.testSecondaryRegionKill(TestRegionReplicaFailover.java:220)

{code}

Will be back

Build has gone a bit wonky. Let me revert this patch though since it does not 'fix' the issue seen. Will close and open a new JIRA after I figure whats up.

Resolving as 'incomplete' after reverting patch pushed yesterday. This is still an issue. Will be back w/ new JIRA after figuring it out.
