    @prabhjyotsingh thank you for fixing this one!
    
    What do you think, if would it make sense to reduce total wait time and get this test more stable with a wait polling implementation to locate such elements, instead of explicit wait everywhere?
    
    I.e there are already one for text and paragraph here [AbstractZeppelinIT.waitForText]( https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-server/src/test/java/org/apache/zeppelin/AbstractZeppelinIT.java#L99) wich uses [AbstractZeppelinIT.pollingWait](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-server/src/test/java/org/apache/zeppelin/AbstractZeppelinIT.java#L108) underneath.
    
    Would it make sense to add something like `AbstractZeppelinIT.waitAndClick()`?

    @bzz fair point;
     - have refactored all AbstractZeppelinIT's sleep calls into ZeppelinITUtils.
     - added another function clickAndWait, which will click and wait for 1s.

    @prabhjyotsingh on closing the JIRA issues, please do not forget to set correct `fix version` field. 
    It's  0.7.0 now if changes were merged only to master, I have updated 1065


Sure, I'll keep that in mind.
