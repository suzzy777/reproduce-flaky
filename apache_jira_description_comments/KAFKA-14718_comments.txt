We are past code freeze for 3.5 so moving this to the next release.

I think a 30-second startup timeout is a bit too conservative for our CI, so bumping the timeout to 60 or even 120 seconds may help.

On top of that, I've also found an actual issue that may be causing some of these flaky test failures. Details in KAFKA-15059.

Backporting this to 3.5 since we have some MM tests failing over there.
