[~txsing] added you to the list of contributors, and assigned this JIRA to you. Thanks for the patch!

[~andras.piros] hey Andras, any news on this patch?

[~txsing] setting to {{PATCH_AVAILABLE}} so that pre-commit Jenkins build kicks in. Will do a code review round once that's done.

Thanks for the contribution [~txsing]! Can you please update {{TestSshActionExecutor}} with a new test case covering retry functionality, as well as extend {{DG_SshActionExtension.twiki}} to document the fix?

Review comments:
* {{SSH_CONNECT_ERROR_CODE}} could be {{final}}
* {{retriesMax}} should be {{retryCount}}
* in order to actually have a chance that the connection error doesn't reoccur, we should {{Thread#sleep()}} some time in between, or use an [*{{ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor}}*|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html] to perform waiting without busy waiting
* the waiting should be based on an exponential backoff like in [*{{OperationRetryHandler#handleRetry()}}*|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/util/db/OperationRetryHandler.java#L123-L129]

[~andras.piros] Will work on it, thanks for the comments.

[~andras.piros]  Test case added.

Thanks for the new patch [~txsing]!

Following is the next round on comments:
* {{SshActionExecutor#handleRetry()}}: {{sleepBeforeRetryMs /= 2;}} should rather be {{sleepBeforeRetryMs *= 2;}}
* the return value of {{SshActionExecutor#handleRetry()}} is not reused in caller code, so it doesn't get really an exponential backoff - {{initWaitTime}} will always be reused
* in {{TestSshActionExecutor#testSshCheckWithHostConnectFailure()}} it's unclear to me whether {{echo "prop1=something"}} would always fail for the first time. We need to inject failure somehow to be on the safe side, or, if already present, extract methods of the test case w/ appropriate names to know what's going on
* extending {{DG_SshActionExtension.twiki}} goes into the right direction. Still, we need to introduce {{oozie-default.xml#oozie.action.ssh.check.retries.max}} with the default value {{3}}, and mention it also in the docs

Hey [~andras.piros], thanks for the review.

In \{{TestSshActionExecutor#testSshCheckWithHostConnectFailure()}}, I copy the code from \{{TestSshActionExecutor#testJobStart}} which gives us an example ends with OK status. In oder to create a "SSH connection failure" situation, I changed action's \{{TrackerUri}} from "\{{<user>@localhost}}"  to "\{{dummy@dummyHost}}" during action status check. An exception is expected to be thrown out, while before this patch, the check method will execute normally and end with OK status.

Do you have any better suggestions on how to design such test case? Thanks!

Hi [~txsing], this is only about readability / code maintainability. For clarity I'd extract these lines:
{code:java}
	        String baseDir = getTestCaseDir();
	        Path appPath = new Path(getNameNodeUri(), baseDir);
	
	        XConfiguration protoConf = new XConfiguration();
	        protoConf.setStrings(WorkflowAppService.HADOOP_USER, getTestUser());
	
	        XConfiguration wfConf = new XConfiguration();
	        wfConf.set(OozieClient.APP_PATH, appPath.toString());
	
	        WorkflowJobBean workflow = new WorkflowJobBean();
	        workflow.setConf(wfConf.toXmlString());
	        workflow.setAppPath(wfConf.get(OozieClient.APP_PATH));
	        workflow.setProtoActionConf(protoConf.toXmlString());
	        workflow.setId(Services.get().get(UUIDService.class).generateId(ApplicationType.WORKFLOW));
	
	        final WorkflowActionBean action = new WorkflowActionBean();
	        action.setId("actionId");
	        action.setConf("<ssh xmlns='" + getActionXMLSchema() + "'>" +
	                       "<host>localhost</host>" +
	                       "<command>echo</command>" +
	                       "<capture-output/>" +
	                       "<args>\"prop1=something\"</args>" +
	                       "</ssh>");
	        action.setName("ssh");
{code}

to a method called {{WorkflowActionBean createSshWorkflowAction()}}.

Moreover, I'd extract these lines:
{code:java}
	        final SshActionExecutor ssh = new SshActionExecutor();
	        final Context context = new Context(workflow, action);
	        ssh.start(context, action);
	
	        String originTrackerUri = action.getTrackerUri();
	        action.setTrackerUri("dummy@dummyHost");
{code}

to a method called {{SshActionExecutor createAndStartFailingSshActionExecutor(WorkflowAction base)}}.

[~andras.piros], Thanks for the clarification! The reason why I didn't extract those lines that create a ssh action bean as an another method called \{{createSshWorkflowAction()}} is that, such kind of action-bean-creation code appears in nearly all test methods of \{{TestSshActionExecutor}}. Shall I do such extraction to all of them also?

[~txsing] good idea! While you're at it, you could modify the signature of the method to be extracted to cover rest of {{TestSshActionExecutor}}. Thanks!

Hint: in patch v4, {{DG_SshActionExtension.twiki#31}} is a line longer than 132 chars, violating {{RAW_PATCH_ANALYSIS}} pre-commit check.
