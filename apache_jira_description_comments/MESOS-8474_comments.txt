This is caused by a race that the master may send out an offer between {{DESTRY_VOLUME}} and {{DESTROY_BLOCK}}. I'll work on a patch to fix this test, possibly by controlling the clock.

This failed again with a different error,

{noformat}
../../src/tests/storage_local_resource_provider_tests.cpp:1877
block is NONE
{noformat}

I attached [the full test log|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12907300/consoleText.txt].

This is a similar issue, but now a race between {{CREATE_VOLUME}} and {{CREATE_BLOCK}}. Will implement a better synchronization logic in this test.

Disabled the test for now.

    Fixed the flakiness of the ROOT_ConvertPreExistingVolume test.
    
    This unit test is flaky because the master might send out an offer
    before both offer operations of a previous `ACCEPT` call are finished.
    This is fixed by manipulating the clock such that no offer won't be
    sent out until the master receives status updates for both operations.
