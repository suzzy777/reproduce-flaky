Per discussion on the dev list, we have decided to implement this as a change to the existing `export logs` command rather than as a new `export artifacts` command.  The default behavior should be to include stat files, but to provide an option like `--exclude-stats`.  We likely also want to run `export stacktrace` automatically for a user as the first step of running `export logs` to make the support/troubleshooting processes as easy as possible.
