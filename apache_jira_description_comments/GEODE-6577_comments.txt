GEODE-6577: performance gain by removing lazy init (#3378)

There was lock contention for checking if the clientMetadataService
needed to be initialized. The object is not expensive to construct, so
the initialization has been moved the GemFireCacheImpl's constructor,
allowing the lock object to be removed completely.
