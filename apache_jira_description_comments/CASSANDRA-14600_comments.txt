Seems the issue because the client tries to re-connect while the server is stopping. When node-1, node-2 are down, but node-3 is still up, QUORUM cannot meet. That's why it's always node-3 has the exception. Here is a patch, please review:
|[14600|https://github.com/cooldoger/cassandra-dtest/tree/14600]|

Verified locally with {{3.0 / 3.11}} and works fine:
{noformat}
pytest --count 10 -p no:flaky --cassandra-dir=~/ws/cassandra auth_test.py::TestAuth::test_system_auth_ks_is_alterable
{noformat}


I verified locally, as well, and test passes. +1
