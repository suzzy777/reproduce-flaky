Beam has a flaky test using Flink savepoints. It looks like alignmentDurationNanos is less than -1, which shouldn't be possible. As far as I know clients (like Beam) don't have any control over this value, so my best guess is that it's a bug in Flink.

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10955?focusedCommentId=17376928&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17376928 for context.

The failing test is here: [https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/b401d23dfc2a487ae5775164a7834952391ff4fa/runners/flink/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/runners/flink/FlinkSavepointTest.java#L146]
