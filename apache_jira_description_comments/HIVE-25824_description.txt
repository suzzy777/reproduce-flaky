Hi everybody,

I am wondering if there are any plans to upgrade branch-2.3 to log4j 2.17.0 as it was done in HIVE-25795 (and related).

In Apache Bigtop we created https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/844, since the one before the last release (Bigtop 1.5.0) shipped Hive 2.3.6.

I can try to file a pull request for branch-2.3 adapting what was done for Bigtop (if the branch is still maintained), but I am currently experiencing some mvn package failures (that seem unrelated to log4j) so I'd need some help for you in case :)
