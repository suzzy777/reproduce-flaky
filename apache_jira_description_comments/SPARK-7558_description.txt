Right now it's really tough to interpret testing output because logs for different tests are interspersed in the same unit-tests.log file. This makes it particularly hard to diagnose flaky tests. This would be much easier if we logged the test name before and after every test (e.g. "Starting test XX", "Finished test XX"). Then you could get right to the logs.

I think one way to do this might be to create a custom test fixture that logs the test class name and then mix that into every test suite /cc [~joshrosen] for his superb knowledge of Scalatest.
