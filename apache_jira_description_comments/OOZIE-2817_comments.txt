This is a great idea.  It should be helpful to get more green runs from Jenkins.  Some minor things:
# Can you run [shellcheck|https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck] on this and fix the (reasonable) things it finds?
# Can you have it report what the flakey tests were (i.e. they failed the first run but passed on the rerun)?  Otherwise, your changes will hide the flakey tests and we won't have a good idea of which tests are flakey anymore.

1) addressed some shellcheck errors. I think they could be fixed as part of an other jira completely. 
2) added list of flaky tests. Let's hope we'll have some when the patch is tested.

Let me kick this off again

I don't think the pre-commit job finished for the second time either. I'm attaching the patch again.

It's hard to verify that this is working correctly, but it seems okay as far as I can tell.  I think the best way is to commit it and we can see it working as we work on other JIRAs; we can always fix/update it later if need be.

+1

Thanks for the review! Committed to master


The number of test failures was checked from the output of the first run.
It should be checked from the rerun's output. If a test is broken, it will fail again.
[~abhishekbafna], can you review this amend patch?


+1.

Thanks for the review! Committed to master!


For the Build: https://builds.apache.org/job/oozie-trunk-precommit-build/3722/consoleFull. 

This build had an flask test which got passed in the rerun. But that information did not got printed in the Jira [comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE-2701?focusedCommentId=15938155&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15938155].

{code}
....
....
    flakyTests=$(cat ${TEMPDIR}/${TASKNAME}.flakies.out)
....
....
        echo "{color:green}+1 ${TASKNAME}{color}" >> $SUMMARYFILE
        echo ".    Tests run: $testsRun" >> $SUMMARYFILE
        if [ -n "${flakyTests}" ]; then
          echo ".    Tests rerun: ${testsReRun}" >> $SUMMARYFILE
          echo ".    Tests failed at first run: ${flakyTests}" >> $SUMMARYFILE
{code}

I think issue was: 

{code}
    failures=$(find . -name '*\.txt' | grep target/surefire-reports | xargs grep  "<<<" | grep -v "Tests run:" | sed 's/.*\.txt\://' | sed 's/ .*//' | grep -o '(\(.*\))' | tr -d '()'  | uniq | awk '{ sub ("\\\\$", ""); printf "%s", $0"," } END { print "" }')
    if [ -n "${failures}" ]; then
       echo "Rerunning failed tests: ${failures}"
       echo $FAILURES > ${TEMPDIR}/${TASKNAME}.flakies.out
{code}

The case for the variable {{FAILURES}} vs {{failures}}.
----
Total tests run in Jenkins Test report: 1,909 (Link: https://builds.apache.org/job/oozie-trunk-precommit-build/3722/testReport)
Total tests run in Comment from Report: 1912.

Not sure, why there is difference, could not reach to a conclusion.

[~gezapeti] Can you please take look here?

Thanks.

Thanks [~abhishekbafna], for the investigation!

You're right about FAILURES vs failures.... I'll fix it with an other amend commit I guess :)
I don't know why the number of tests is different in Jenkins and in our report. I haven't touched that part but it looks like it just sums up the numbers from the Junit output.
Maybe we're running some tests twice as part of a suite and Jenkins merges those results?

Attaching amend patch with fix.

+1. Committed to master. Thanks [~gezapeti].

Just a thought, going forward we should create a separate issue for this, as we have already done two amends. :)

Thanks for the review [~abhishekbafna]!
I promise I won't do an other amend commit for this jira :)

Closing issue; Oozie 5.0.0-beta1 is released
