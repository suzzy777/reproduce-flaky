URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7191
 
 
   Since `Metrics` was constructed with `enableExpiration=false`, this was
   not a source of flakiness given the current implementation. This could
   change in the future, so good to follow the class contract.
   
   Included a few clean-ups with regards to redundant casts and type parameters
   as well as usage of try with resources for inline usage of `Metrics`.

Good catch [~apovzner]. Unfortunately this was not a source of test flakiness since `Metrics` had been created withÂ enableExpiration=false. Still good to fix.
