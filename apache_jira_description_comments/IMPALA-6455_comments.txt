The error looks a lot like IMPALA-6108. In that case Phil worked around it by setting a different local /tmp directory for each hive invocation: https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/8405/5/bin/load-data.py

IMPALA-6455: unique tmpdirs for test_partition_metadata_compatibility

Concurrent hive statements running in local mode can race to modify
the contents of temporary directories - see IMPALA-6108. This applies
the workaround for IMPALA-6108 to the run_stmt_in_hive() utility
function, which is used by test_partition_metadata_compatibility.

Testing:
I wasn't able to reproduce the race locally, but I ran the test and
confirmed that it still passed. I also confirmed that the temporary
directories /tmp/impala-tests-* were created using "ls" while the
tests were running.
