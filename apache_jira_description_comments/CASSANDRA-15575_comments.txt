There can be a thread returned in getAllThreadIds that dies before getThreadInfo is called on it, resulting in the NPE.  The simplest thing to do is just filter out nulls here, and the good news is this condition very rarely occurs, so whatever thread it is that is dying before we get its info, is safe as far as the test is concerned.  Patch to filter nulls here: https://github.com/driftx/cassandra/tree/CASSANDRA-15575

{code}
/**
     * Returns the thread info for each thread
     * whose ID is in the input array <tt>ids</tt> with no stack trace.
     * This method is equivalent to calling:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *   {@link #getThreadInfo(long[], int) getThreadInfo}(ids, 0);
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * <p>
     * This method returns an array of the <tt>ThreadInfo</tt> objects.
     * The stack trace, locked monitors, and locked synchronizers
     * in each <tt>ThreadInfo</tt> object will be empty.
     *
     * If a thread of a given ID is not alive or does not exist,
     * the corresponding element in the returned array will
     * contain <tt>null</tt>.  A thread is alive if
     * it has been started and has not yet died.
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>MBeanServer access</b>:<br>
     * The mapped type of <tt>ThreadInfo</tt> is
     * <tt>CompositeData</tt> with attributes as specified in the
     * {@link ThreadInfo#from ThreadInfo.from} method.
     *
     * @param ids an array of thread IDs.
     * @return an array of the {@link ThreadInfo} objects, each containing
     * information about a thread whose ID is in the corresponding
     * element of the input array of IDs
     * with no stack trace, no locked monitor and no synchronizer info.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if any element in the input array
     *         <tt>ids</tt> is {@code <= 0}.
     * @throws java.lang.SecurityException if a security manager
     *         exists and the caller does not have
     *         ManagementPermission("monitor").

The documented behavior is null means not found, so the filter LGTM
