The test worked like this:

insert initial rows
Loop:
  choose insert, update, or delete op randomly
  Every n iterations flush and check values against expectation.

This should be instead:

insert initial rows
Loop:
  Every n iterations flush and check values against expectation.
  choose insert, update, or delete op randomly

This way we can be certain the initial rows are flushed and present before we do a mutation on them. Otherwise, there's a possibility a batch will be sent with an insert and delete operation.

Fixed in commit d35cd98.
