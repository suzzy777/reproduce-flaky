I recently ran a specific test at the CLI via gradle to see if a particular build failure repeats.  It includes the {{--tests}} command line option to specify the test.  The test passed.  Later I wanted to run it again; I suspected it might be flakey.  Gradle completed in 10 seconds, and I'm certain it didn't actually run the test. There was no printout and the build/test-results/test/outputs/...  from the test run still had not changed from previously.

Mike Drob informed me of "gradlew cleanTest" but I'd prefer to not have to know about that, at least not for the specific case of wanting to execute a specific test.
