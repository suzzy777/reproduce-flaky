When the log level is set to DEBUG and we had to wait for the compile lock then there will be duplicate messages written to the log files every time:
{code}
2017-03-28T07:13:45,520 DEBUG [8b9772ae-cab0-4eb4-8256-404222a5caa0 HiveServer2-Handler-Pool: Thread-71] ql.Driver: Waiting to acquire compile lock: drop table if exists drop_with_concurrency_1
Waiting to acquire compile lock.
2017-03-28T07:13:45,520 DEBUG [8b9772ae-cab0-4eb4-8256-404222a5caa0 HiveServer2-Handler-Pool: Thread-71] ql.Driver: Acquired the compile lock.
Acquired the compile lock.
{code}

To handle this situation we had be sure, that the logs are filtered in a specific order with the patters.

[~ychena], could you please review?

Thanks,
Peter

[~pvary], So whenever a debug message appear in the log, it will be in the duplicate way? Do you know why?
Your fix looks fine to handle the duplicate case.  
+1 pending tests

Forget to start the tests :)

[~ychena]: The log messages are written out from Driver.tryAcquireCompileLock.
When the log level is DEBUG, then it will print out the message to the logs. If we use BeeLine, these logs are diverted to the {{OperationLog}} as well by the {{LogDivertAppender}}, so it will be printed to the output.
Above the DEBUG level logs, when we have to wait for the lock, we specifically write that out to the {{OperationLog}} too.
{code}
    // If the first shot fails, then we log the waiting messages.
    if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
      LOG.debug("Waiting to acquire compile lock: " + command);
    }

    OperationLog ol = OperationLog.getCurrentOperationLog();
{code}

I was thinking about changing the Driver code, to remove the duplications, but I decided against it since there are different configurations for the {{LOG}}-s, and for the {{OperationLog}}, so this is the only way, that we can be sure that the log is written.

The two failures are not related. 
Committed the fix to master.
Thanks [~pvary] for your contribution. 


Hi [~pvary] Looks like drop_with_concurrency is failing again in the most recent commits.

[~vihangk1], thanks for reporting!

Caused by these parallel changes:
- HIVE-16297: Improving hive logging configuration variables
- HIVE-16308: PreExecutePrinter and PostExecutePrinter should log to INFO level instead of ERROR

Addressed by: HIVE-16345

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
