I've just seen the same error, so it's still flaky.

We don't need the following line in the test method anymore, because after OOZIE-1807 bundle changes are synchronous:
{noformat}
sleep(1000); // time for the queued CoordChangeXCommand to complete{noformat}
but I don't think it explains the flakiness.
