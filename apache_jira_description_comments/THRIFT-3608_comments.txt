Since there is no assert message printed out in these failures, and the failures happen at ~random points in the test matrix, it seems to me the classic evil of using a fixed port is to blame here and its leading to port bind failures.  Before understanding the failure cases and/or asynchrony of server socket shutdown, SO_LINGER, etc that may be at-play, I'll try converting over to using an ephemeral port which the test _should_ be doing anyway.

Real fix is here: https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/848

The issue was a bad {{#ifdef linux}} - should be {{#ifdef \_\_linux\_\_}}.
Under standards compliance modes, both g++ and clang++ will not define the deprecated {{linux}} symbol.  We compile using {{-std=c++11}} and so {{SecutityTest}} would fail to find {{linux}} defined and thus fail to setup ignoring {{SIGPIPE}} which led to flaky test failures.

For posterity - this trick helped seal the diagnosis:
{noformat}
$ touch foo.cc
$ g++ -dM -E foo.cc | grep linux
#define __linux 1
#define __linux__ 1
#define __gnu_linux__ 1
#define linux 1
$ g++ -std=c++11 -dM -E foo.cc | grep linux
#define __linux 1
#define __linux__ 1
#define __gnu_linux__ 1
$ clang++ -dM -E foo.cc | grep linux
#define __gnu_linux__ 1
#define __linux 1
#define __linux__ 1
#define linux 1
$ clang++ -std=c++11 -dM -E foo.cc | grep linux
#define __gnu_linux__ 1
#define __linux 1
#define __linux__ 1
{noformat}

Thanks [~jensg] - I'll comment over there and close that bug as duplicate to this since I have a solution spinning in jenkins CI now.

Passing now though failing at another ~commmon flaky in python: https://builds.apache.org/job/Thrift-precommit/86/console

[~jensg] - If you can confirm this fixes the issue you had as described in THRIFT-3362 I think its ready to merge.

I filed this for the flaky python issue: THRIFT-3616

It will not get worse, it will only get better. So don't wait for my confirmation. I'll check it in the next days.

I'm not sure I follow the don't wait part.  I do need to wait on some committer to review and merge.  If you can recommend an appropriate one I'd be grateful.

committed thanks !

Thank you! Thrift-precommit should hopefully be going green now for github PRs.

SUCCESS: Integrated in Thrift-precommit #95 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Thrift-precommit/95/])
