[~npeltier] it seems the unit tests for sling pipes are very flaky on the apache CI:
https://ci-builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Sling%2Fmodules%2Fsling-org-apache-sling-pipes/activity?branch=PR-16

sometime they pass, sometimes (very often) only the sonarcloud build with java 11 fails, sometimes already the first java 8 build fails in the pipeline. locally the tests pass fine. did you observe this before? any idea about the reason? most time the JsonPipeTest unit test is affected, sometimes the integration tests as well.

[~sseifert] no i have not, will check

released with 4.5.0
