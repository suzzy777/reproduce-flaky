GEODE-5259: Remove classId from DataSerializable

- Test using type_info
- First cut at removing getClassId() from DataSerializable
- Switch to find instead of [ ] operator
- Update clicache integration tests to use new DataSerializable interface.
- Added new CSharp serialization test.
- Removed all reference to ClassId and added "type" to the Managed wrapper of DataSerializables plus tests
- Rebased with develop: switch to DSCode
- Make the DSCode version of bind private
- Cleanup bind function
- Fix serialize (wasn't writing the DSCode and the user typeId).
- Added a composite custom object test
- Update tests to use proper typeId (to match java classes).
- Update clicache integration tests to use new DataSerializable interface.
- Added new CSharp serialization test.
- Removed all reference to ClassId and added "type" to the Managed wrapper of DataSerializables plus tests
- Make the DSCode version of bind private
- Added a composite custom object test
- Update tests to use proper typeId (to match java classes).
- Switch TypeId for Portfolio and Position in clicache tests to coorespond with the Java versions of each.
- Updated DataSerializable test to use explicit compares of strings
- changed uint32_t to int32_t in TypeRegistry
- Refactor to remove compID (composite ID) and use better naming of maps
  All id's are now int32_t and bit shifts were removed
- Copy geode-native symbols to allow debugging
- Refactor bind into bindDataSerializable and bindDataSerializableFixedId and rename maps
- Switch back to std::type_info
- Added ManagedDataSerializableHandler support.
- Intercepting handling of DataSerializables for managed and unmanaged.
- Refactored SerializationRegistry to collapse overloaded methods.
- Added helper methods to support the (de)serializtion methods.
- DataOutput api changed to only support std::shared_ptr<Serializable>
- Managed TypeRegistry has improved mnemonics of maps and accessors
- also removed obsolete native delegate creation
- Only copy the pdb for Debug builds
- Test code shouldn't eat exceptions when creating the cache.
- Split out DataSerializablePrimitives map.
- Refactored map names to be more expressive.
- Remove DataSerializableInternal::getInternal().
- Fix rename error of DSCodeToFactoryMap
- Fix and reformat clicache SerializationTests
- Update examples to new DataSerializable api
- Fix missing Type property in example code
- Just use System::Type in IDataSerializable
- Cleanup formatting and dead code
- Remove IDataSerializable::Type property (no longer needed)
- More file cleanup from review.
- Remove Type property from an example.
