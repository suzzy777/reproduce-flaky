Uploading test failure log for analysis.. will investigate and post the patch

Hi [~brahmareddy] , i tested this in a loop but it passed each time.

We see this failure on our clusters running 2.10 as well.

[~ajayydv], Do you have any update on the progress of this jira?

I have recently worked on this one and as per build results, I see this test consistently passing. Let me attach PR on this Jira rather than creating new Jira. The only diff is patch is applicable to both TestDecommissioningStatusWithBackoffMonitor#testDecommissionStatus and TestDecommissioningStatus#testDecommissionStatus.

PR: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/3280

 

FYI [~brahmareddy] if you would also like to review and include this test stability in 3.2.3 (or perhaps since no source code is changed as part of this patch, maybe 3.2.3 backport is not needed).

Hi [~vjasani]
Thanks for taking a look at this jira. I have few comments:
* can you please describe what the purpose of the change to resolve the issue?
* if it is not evident that the changes are resolving the original issue this ticket was filed for, then it would be better to open a new jira , then later this very jira can be resolved. You can also link this jira to the new one. In That way,  anyone who was aware of the problem would be able to understand that it has been resolved.
* Changing title/description for an old jira is not very good idea (unless there was error or typo) because it will be difficult for other developers to see that what they have filed/contributed to has been resolved. They need to guess then look inside the transitions/history of the jiras to find what they have been looking for.
* For future jiras, I personally prefer that a new jira is filed leaving the existing ones as they are (until they are marked as resolved).

Sure [~ahussein], I think it makes sense to not loose the history. Although the Exception stacktrace is exactly matching but this Jira was filed long back and the same test might likely have had different issue. Let me detach PR from this one and create new Jira. Thanks.

Sorry for the noise everyone. Let me get back to this Jira once new Jira is filed, has more test results to rely on and then we can decide on whether we would like to attach this Jira to new one and close this.

Thanks [~vjasani]! I am looking forward to seeing the new jira.
Just a brief description of how the refactored code brings more stability to the unit test would be good enough.

Thanks [~vjasani]. I marked this issue as fixed by HDFS-16171.
