This one fails often. 31% and 35% according to recent flakies report in GCE section.

Test stops cluster, puts a latch on SCP, restarts the cluster and then verifies stuff happens as expected. But if the latched SCP happens to be for the server that had the namespace table on it, then the Master won't come up and the test times out. Its a crapshoot.

Attach patch that selects server other than the one carrying namespace to examine. Trying on branch-2 first.

Resolving. Pushed on branch-2 and master. Looks like this was fixed before back in HBASE-22964 but the forward port dropped the namespace check that this adds for some reason.
