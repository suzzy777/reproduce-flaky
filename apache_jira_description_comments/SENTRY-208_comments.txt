This looks like a bug in derby: https://github.com/cloudstore/cloudstore/issues/10


Ran our flaky tests 150 times after bumping up the derby version(10.10.2.0), and the flakyness seems to have resolved. Attaching a patch.


Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The build failure is due to RAT check which doesn't look related to the patch.

Patch committed to master.
