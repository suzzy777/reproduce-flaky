[~ningk], [~rohdesam] do you know what's happening here?

I think it's something with Python file IO on windows. Some similar issues: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33322932/windowserror-error-32-the-process-cannot-access-the-file-because-it-is-being.

I'll suggest temporarily disable the test from running on windows.
Let me make a change to do so.

I think the root cause is in windows, shutil.rmtree cannot delete a directory with files that are open by other processes.

In StreamingCache, there is a place where "open"/"close" a file is decoupled: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/interactive/caching/streaming_cache.py#L116.

This test is not flaky. The flakiness is the cleanup of the current interactive environment after last test execution. Some of the opened file handlers are not closed.

I'll do some further investigation.

I searched the whole code base, there are only 3 occurrences of `ie.current_env().set_recording_manager`: https://github.com/apache/beam/search?q=set_recording_manager

One of them started a background recording job and added that recording manager to the global instance ie.current_env().
I'll remove that occurrence.

PR#14558 merged. Let's keep the ticket open for a while and see if this issue re-occurs.

I don't see any instances of this over the last couple of days so I'll go ahead and close. Thanks Ning!
