This came up in a discussion I had with Stack.
It would be nice if HBase could be notified that a backup is in progress (via a znode for example) and in that case either:
1. rename HFiles to be delete to <file>.bck
2. rename the HFiles into a special directory
3. rename them to a general trash directory (which would not need to be tied to backup mode).

That way it should be able to get a consistent backup based on HFiles (HDFS snapshots or hard links would be better options here, but we do not have those).

#1 makes cleanup a bit harder.
