[PYTHON-206|https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/PYTHON-206] introduced the ability to change the initial connection timeout on connections from the default of 5s.

This change was introduced because some auth providers (kerberos) can take longer than 5s to complete a first time negotiation for a connection. 

cqlsh should allow this setting to be changed.
