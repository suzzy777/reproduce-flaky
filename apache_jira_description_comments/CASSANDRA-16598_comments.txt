I see also some of the other StreamingMetrics tests being flaky in Jenkins:

[https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/436/testReport/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.metrics/StreamingMetricsTest/]

While reviewing CASSANDRA-16190 I looped the tests and they were fine back then...

I can try to take a look tomorrow.

Different type of [failure|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/435/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.metrics/StreamingMetricsTest/testMetricsWithRepairAndStreamingFromTwoNodes/]  for the same test _testMetricsWithRepairAndStreamingFromTwoNodes_ in Jenkins:
{code:java}
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: [The amount of data received by node1 from node3 is not the expected one. [expected: 0, actual: 62]] expected:<[0]L> but was:<[62]L>

found another case, and several of the tests failed here: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra/886/workflows/3bc0b75e-0dfa-45f6-b5d2-50377a067473/jobs/5304

I was looping them overnight and didn't manage to reproduce anything on my machine

[~adelapena] did you manage to repro and you're onto sthg or should I give it a try?

[~bereng] I haven't being able to repro either locally or in the multiplexer. Of the two mentioned failures the one in line 88 is quite puzzling since it's just checking that rows haven't made it into a node that has been stopped while the others were being written, with hints disabled. I think [~blerer] was also looking into this, I'm unassigning myself to let you guys give it a go.

The CircleCi-based test multiplexer proposed in CASSANDRA-16625 has managed to reproduce the failure  in [this run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/373/workflows/f1612e92-8a59-483b-bc79-d6f29a7f5766/jobs/3260]. There are failures for {{StreamingMetricsTest#testMetricsWithRepairAndStreamingToTwoNodes}} too.

The problem seems to be linked to the In-JVM framework. The nodes seems to still receive some updates after shutdown.
I pushed a [PR|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1053] to fix the problem by using filter instead of shutting down nodes.
I ran the tests 100 times on CI using the multiplexer without any failures. The result can be found [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/blerer/cassandra/145/workflows/e6e5e51b-5047-42a1-ac77-60bcdaf64b9c]

I confirm this is a known issue from CASSANDRA-16679

I will take a look at the patch itself later today. Thank you!

That should work, the proposed solution is used already also for other tests and proved as a good workaround of the mentioned issue.

+1, thanks a lot!
