The 3 tests in TestCrudCompactorOnTez which use the ProtoLoggingHook run at different times. Unfortunately, the 3 tests are run at the following times as described in the logs - 
Test 1 - 
{code:java}
INFO [main] compactor.TestCrudCompactorOnTez: Current time: 2022-12-15T23:57:44 {code}
Test 2 - 
{code:java}
INFO [main] compactor.TestCrudCompactorOnTez: Current time: 2022-12-16T00:00:32 {code}
Test 3 - 
{code:java}
INFO [main] compactor.TestCrudCompactorOnTez: Current time: 2022-12-16T00:04:12 {code}
As we can see, the tests are run on 2 different dates. Therefore, HiveProtoLoggingHook generates a unique event logs for every unique date. This is the behaviour of HiveProtoLoggingHook.
[https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/hooks/HiveProtoLoggingHook.java#L296-L310]

However the expectation from the test side, while generating the log readers is that there must be a single file in the log folder defined.
[https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/test/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/hooks/TestHiveProtoLoggingHook.java#L310] 

Unfortunately, since there are 2 files which are generated (as mentioned in the logs as well), the following tests fail - 
{code:java}
INFO [main] hooks.TestHiveProtoLoggingHook: List of paths: 
INFO [main] hooks.TestHiveProtoLoggingHook: file:/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/internal-hive-flaky-check/itests/hive-unit/target/tmp/junit441259831997042392/junit3438435196942546140/date=2022-12-15
INFO [main] hooks.TestHiveProtoLoggingHook: file:/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/internal-hive-flaky-check/itests/hive-unit/target/tmp/junit441259831997042392/junit3438435196942546140/date=2022-12-16 {code}
The solution is to make _getTestReader()_ in _TestHiveProtoLoggingHook_ more compatible with multiple event log file scenario and be able to generate multiple readers for all files present in the folder instead of fixating on a single file clause.
