    A few tests are set to iOS 8 like https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/tests/spec/unit/fixtures/test-config-2.xml#L15
    
    Should them also be updated?

    Travis CI: Looks like the iOS Simulator was never even run, and it failed. Tested it locally again and it works. Flaky CI (esp since it took over 24 hours before this was run on CI)
    
    @jcesarmobile looks like the tests even pass with that 8.0 value in. Which tells me that value was never tested in the first place? (bad test)

CB-12523 - Remove iOS 8 support

Explicitly launch iOS Simulator before objc-tests to get around Travis CI flakiness

 This closes #293

can you re-add ios8 support?
as a lot of users (for example my app users from appstore ) still has their phones not updated
thank you

[~MATRIXREAL] no, we cannot. We remove support because we can't test for iOS 8 anymore with our limited resources. Not that the code can't support iOS 8, it can (but its up to you to tweak).

Just set a {{deployment-target}} preference to "8.0" in your config.xml: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/#preference
