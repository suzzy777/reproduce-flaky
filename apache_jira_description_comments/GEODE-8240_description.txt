This problem was introduced in 1.12.0 and is present in all lines derived from that one, including 9.10, 1.13, and current develop/1.14

What's actually happening is that the locator _is_ upgraded to a newer version. It joins with an older coordinator (that's running e.g. 1.12.0) and that coordinator produces a view showing the new locator/member as running the same version, in this case 1.12.0, as the coordinator.

Eventually, all locators will be upgraded. But the view carries the incorrect version indication.

The root cause seems to be that when {{GMSMemberData.setVersionObject(short versionOrdinal)}} sees a version ordinal that is unknown, i.e. a version ordinal corresponding to a new line of development: 1.13, 1.14, … that method throws away that version ordinal and replaces it with the one for the 1.12 line.

Since the current {{support/1.13}} and {{develop}} branches have the bug upgrading a current 1.13 to 1.14 or a current development/1.14 to 1.15 would exhibit the same behavior (locator apparently stuck at the older version in the view.)

Ramifications of this incorrect version indication in the view are TBD.

Whether or not this situation resolves itself after _another_ round of restarts is TBD.
