The failure can be reproduced on CircleCI, as it's shown by [this run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1540/workflows/6623b815-7379-4237-b371-e699b359c749].

It seems that the OOM goes away if we split the tests into {{CompactStorageUpgradeTest}}, with one method per class:

||Patch||CI||
|[trunk|https://github.com/adelapena/cassandra/commit/868f3e6fdeb2cc570e4dbc13bbb497b2c8b7684a]|[j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1539/workflows/586f64cf-09ad-415d-b690-7a343dc62ba2]|

However, I don't know why we don't see the same consistent OOM on {{cassandra-4.0}} nor {{cassandra-4.1}} branches.

I have managed to repro the OOM on [{{cassandra-4.0}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1546/workflows/2e1a0466-eb37-4c0d-be84-f549d05fd2a0] with more repetitions, but not on [{{cassandra-4.1}}|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1545/workflows/55c6d848-ca74-495f-a587-665ed1e70fcd]. I don't understand why there is that difference in test flakiness between branches, but probably we should break the test class in all three branches.

I was also looking into this on the side, I was thinking it might be Circle config on different branches (didn't find difference).  Also, we see the same behavior in Jenkins. Maybe some in-jvm difference I don't know. 

The solution SGTM

Here are the PRs splitting the tests for all the branches, they are identical:
||PR||CI||
|[4.0 |https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1626]|[j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1554/workflows/fe83bfb0-f206-47a4-b8ff-18f740beb2e8]|
|[4.1 |https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1627]|[j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1555/workflows/756ff32a-eaf8-4857-af14-af7d0f1a0245]|
|[trunk|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1628]|[j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1553/workflows/18d4e88e-b030-4fb6-8d4c-7936ab7fab00]|

It seems that 4.0 is still failing, but this time with a different type of error. I think that the OOM was masking this 4.0-only test failure. To see it more clearly, [this simpler patch|https://github.com/adelapena/cassandra/commit/9f8e8f80624cd984802508d5eeab78a4018a2ce0] just removes all other tests from {{{}CompactStorageUpgradeTest{}}}, and it still reproduces the errors on [this run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1557/workflows/eb22ae1e-4f0b-430f-be94-cb6d4f89cc5a].

Interesting, I would have expected this to fail in 4.1 and trunk, not only on 4.0 Good it is disabled by default

I haven't found the reason for the 4.0 failure but it seems that splitting the test to prevent OOMs in all branches is something that we are going to want anyway. Would it makes sense to fix the OOM here and then open a followup ticket for the different failure in 4.0?

Makes total sense to me, +1 to commit the split. 

[~adelapena] , I think we need the patch also ported to 3.11? (at least the split)

Yes, right, we should also split the tests in 3.11. The tests are quite different in that branch and their names are quite long, I hope that the new names that I have used for the classes make sense:
||PR||CI pre-fix||CI post-fix||
|[3.11|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1629]|[j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1558/workflows/34021f5a-1543-4b8a-b67c-801b7987d1ba]|[j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1561/workflows/bb9096e7-ebc4-46ee-90eb-53dd8d42a4c0]|

As it happened with 4.0, [the tests OOM|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1558/workflows/34021f5a-1543-4b8a-b67c-801b7987d1ba] quite easily without splitting them., and once we get rid of the OOMs [a new type of failure|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1561/workflows/bb9096e7-ebc4-46ee-90eb-53dd8d42a4c0] gets exposed. To make sure that that masked failure isn't introduced by a mistake while splitting, I have run {{CompactStorage2to3UpgradeTest#testDropCompactWithClusteringAndValueColumnWithDeletesAndWrites}} unpatched and in isolation. [That experiment|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1562/workflows/77329cd5-3d3d-4a8f-beb5-8f64818df0f5] shows that the test is indeed flaky independently of the OOM that we are trying to fix here.

Hit a timeout in this test here: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/maedhroz/cassandra/411/workflows/3f77508a-548a-4a17-a086-474afd9653f4/jobs/3151/tests#failed-test-0

That seems a JUnit timeout that we could fix by the proposed test splitting, same as the OOMs. [~e.dimitrova] are we ready to commit the splitting of the test? After that, we can open followup tickets for the masked non-OOM/timeout failures on 3.11 and 4.0.

The splits look good, only I noticed you probably missed to rename the _DropCompactStorageTest_ class? You moved there the 

_testDropCompactWithClusteringAndValueColumn_ and the previous test running there was moved to its own class - _DropCompactStorageBeforeUpgradeSSTablesTest_

 

Otherwise +1, the name change can be done on commit

Yep, I missed renaming that class in 3.11, thanks. I have renamed it, rebased all branches and run CI one (hopefully) last time:

It seems that the run for trunk has hit [a failure on {{testDropCompactStorage}} that is not an OOM|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1624/workflows/c4ce2b95-998f-459b-830e-8e3fa6637e15/jobs/17293/tests]. This failure can be reproduced on {{trunk}} without the patch, as it's shown by [this run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1634/workflows/02fed5e0-66f7-4a82-8664-d1484ef24683/jobs/17303/artifacts]. So that's another failure marked by the OOMs addressed by this ticket, with a 1.4% flakiness.

[~e.dimitrova] this is ready to commit despite of the latest non-OOM test failures, isn’t it?

I just went through the failures, the issue you were fixing is solved, we need to open tickets for the rest.

I would like to mention that I noticed once the NullPointerException from trunk on 3.11
Still +1 on committing the current fix. Thanks

Thanks, committed to 3.11 as [8a9ba8866db6162a7b7352a260122d6e3c219567|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/8a9ba8866db6162a7b7352a260122d6e3c219567] and merged to [4.0|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/fbad08979edc6cb88169c92d071b000846d6974a], [4.1|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/a4196cfb30363b5a05d1ca54a5191f82e4ad64bd] and [trunk|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/770733367fd84e6f9cb29083bd8bffb698cb14f5].

I'll create the followup tickets in a bit.

Just opened CASSANDRA-17673 and CASSANDRA-17674 for the other failures.

Thanks!
