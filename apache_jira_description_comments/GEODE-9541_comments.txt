GEODE-9541: Explicitly unsubscribe after each test in SubCommandsIntegrationTest (#6821)

- Jedis does not track psubscribe and subscribe requests separately.
  Thus a psubscribe followed by unsubscribe, (when no subscribes exist),
  will cause the client to think everything is unsubscribed and
  disconnect the MockSubscriber. This makes cleanup in a generic way
  difficult, if not impossible. Now, instead of trying to clean up in
  @After, each test does its own cleanup.
