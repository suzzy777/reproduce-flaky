Adding this to the high priority list due to incorrect output vs. timing issue

Not sure if this counts as a failure or not, but: reported as failed on this build [https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk11-scala2.13/2565/]

...however when you click the test, instead of a stacktrace it just says "*Passed*" 

It isn't a true duplicate, but both flaky tests have the same underlying flaw: depending on specific interleavings produced when running 3 Streams instances concurrently.

It might be possible (and desirable) to make such a test work, but the facts of life are that our testing environment doesn't have enough resources to run a test like this reliably.

So, I'm fixing both issues with the same PR and just moving the whole test over to TopologyTestDriver.
