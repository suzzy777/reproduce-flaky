The full output of the test-patch run is available at

The failing unit tests are flaky also on upstream master and unrelated. These are connected to [*this issue*|OOZIE-2815].

[~pbacsko] [~gezapeti] can you please have a look?

I'd rather not have us do a bunch of expensive class loading/finding on every launcher job submission.  I think we'd be better off doing this at startup and remembering it.

LGTM - [~andras.piros] please address Robert's comment.

Thanks [~pbacsko] and [~rkanter] for the reviews! Addressing review comments in this patch.

Thanks for the contribution!
Some nit-picking:
# There is a ActionExecutor.CONF_PREFIX with the value "oozie.action". Please use that in the constants.
# I generally like to hard-code the constants in the tests so it the value of a constant changes, things break.
# I think the name {{oozie.action.launcher.mapreduce.input.format.classname}} would fit Oozie's current property-naming scheme better.
