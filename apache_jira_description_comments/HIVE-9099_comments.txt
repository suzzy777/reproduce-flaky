Just found that this may related to HIVE-8981, we may need to remove infer_bucket_sort_convert_join.q and mapjoin_hook.q from auto test list if we does not support backup task for mapjoin query with Spark, It fails the qtest after HIVE-9078(which it should be).

[~chengxiang li] Yes, we should disable these two. Thanks for discovering this!


Patch disables the two tests for now to avoid noise. We will create a followup JIRA to track the backup task issue.
