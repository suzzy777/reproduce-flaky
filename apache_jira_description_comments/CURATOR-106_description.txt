For guaranteed deletes (eg. lock releases) that fail, the FailedDeleteManager issues another guaranteed delete here:

In an environment where ZK has the potential to be down for an extended period of time, this has the potential to recurse until there is a stack overflow (particularly if the application is using multiple locks.)
