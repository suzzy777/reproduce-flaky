We thought we'd hammered the compaction daemon tests out, but there's still a situation where the test can time out. This has happened at least 4 times since Paul Davis checked in his fixes.

{noformat}
module 'couchdb_compaction_daemon_tests'
  Compaction daemon tests
    couchdb_compaction_daemon_tests:74: should_compact_by_default_rule...*timed out*
    undefined
  couchdb_compaction_daemon_tests:109: should_compact_by_dbname_rule...*timed out*
  undefined
{noformat}

Sometimes, only one of the tests times out:
{noformat}
module 'couchdb_compaction_daemon_tests'
  Compaction daemon tests
    couchdb_compaction_daemon_tests:74: should_compact_by_default_rule...*timed out*
    undefined
  couchdb_compaction_daemon_tests:109: should_compact_by_dbname_rule...[38.982 s] ok
