It looks like review https://reviews.apache.org/r/55893/ does not really fix what it aims to fix. The problem is in [this loop|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/src/tests/oversubscription_tests.cpp?utf8=%E2%9C%93#L549-L552]: {{offers.get()}} removes items from the collection we iterate over and hence defeats the purpose of merging resources from all offers.

Fixed flaky RescindRevocableOfferWithIncreasedRevocable test.

This is addendum to review https://reviews.apache.org/r/55893/.
The loop that merges outstanding offers can miss some because it
removes the items from the collection it iterates over.
