This is related to YARN-257(it's probably a sub task?). Currently, the NM does not detect full disks and allows full disks to be used by containers leading to repeated failures. YARN-257 deals with graceful handling of full disks. This ticket is only about detection of full disks by the disk health checkers.

The NM should allow users to set a maximum disk utilization for local disks and mark disks as bad once they exceed that utilization. At the very least, the NM should at least detect full disks.
