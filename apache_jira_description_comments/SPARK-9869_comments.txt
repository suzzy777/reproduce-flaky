My pull request build for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10431 failed with this error so I took a look. I think it's another timing issue where the assert on the progress listener occurs before the asynchronous notification thread has completed processing.

Something like this should fix it:

diff --git a/streaming/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/streaming/InputStreamsSuite.scala b/streaming/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/streaming/InputStreamsSuite.scala

         // Verify all "InputInfo"s have been reported
         assert(ssc.progressListener.numTotalReceivedRecords === input.size)
         assert(ssc.progressListener.numTotalProcessedRecords === input.size)


should I add this change to the PR for Spark-10431 or submit PR for this?

Since they're probably distinct issues even if they have a similar fix, in different tests, tracked already by different JIRAs, just make a new PR for this JIRA to try out the fix.
