azagrebin opened a new pull request #7154: [FLINK-10946] Silent checkpoint async failures in task executor if job is not runnning
URL: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7154
 
 
   ## What is the purpose of the change
   
   When job is canceled, task closable registry is closed asynchronously and checkpoints cannot register with it any more from main thread. This leads to logging error message. The PR changes the behaviour and generates error only if job is still running, assuming that after cancelation checkpoint errors are not relevant any more.
   
   ## Brief change log
   
    - throw exception in AbstractStreamOperator.snapshotState only if job is still running.
   
   ## Verifying this change
   
   in loop (failure was flaky):
   cd flink-end-to-end-tests
   ./run-single-test.sh test-scripts/test_resume_externalized_checkpoints.sh 2 4 rocks true true

 Review comment:
   I think we should throw the exception in any case, so as to not return any value here. That also matches the previous behaviour, only the logging was added and needs to be guarded, the exception is already silenced.
