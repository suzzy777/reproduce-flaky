master_failover-itest seems to be about 20% flaky right now, usually due to TestRenameTableSync. We should disable this until we have time to understand what's going on. On a brief look, it seems like the master service queue is piling up with GetMasterRegistration RPCs which are potentially causing a distributed deadlock (or maybe a single-node deadlock). Since it's easy to reproduce, I won't post logs here.
