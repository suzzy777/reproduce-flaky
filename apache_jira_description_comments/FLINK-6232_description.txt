The goal of this issue is to add support for inner equi-join on proc time streams to the SQL interface.
Queries similar to the following should be supported:
{code}
SELECT o.proctime, o.productId, o.orderId, s.proctime AS shipTime 
FROM Orders AS o 
JOIN Shipments AS s 
ON o.orderId = s.orderId 
AND o.proctime BETWEEN s.proctime AND s.proctime + INTERVAL '1' HOUR;
{code}

The following restrictions should initially apply:
* The join hint only support inner join
* The ON clause should include equi-join condition
* The time-condition {{o.proctime BETWEEN s.proctime AND s.proctime + INTERVAL '1' HOUR}} only can use proctime that is a system attribute, the time condition only support bounded time range like {{o.proctime BETWEEN s.proctime - INTERVAL '1' HOUR AND s.proctime + INTERVAL '1' HOUR}}, not support unbounded like {{o.proctime > s.protime}},  and  should include both two stream's proctime attribute, {{o.proctime between proctime() and proctime() + 1}} should also not be supported.

This issue includes:
* Design of the DataStream operator to deal with stream join
* Translation from Calcite's RelNode representation (LogicalJoin).
