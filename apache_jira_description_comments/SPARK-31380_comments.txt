Did you run your application with Spark 3? I tested it in my local 3.0 build and I saw the spark history server UI can display non-zero Peak Execution Memory.

I tested this with spark master at the time of creating this ticket. I am not seeing this issue with the current master and with spark-3.0.0-preview2. I guess the issue might have gone away recently. The issue definitely exists with spark-2.4.5. 

The history server might be flaky. That could be a reason why we are seeing this issue intermittently. For example when I tried to run my application to test it I am able to see the metrics in safari but not in chrome.  !image-2020-04-16-11-04-59-036.png!
