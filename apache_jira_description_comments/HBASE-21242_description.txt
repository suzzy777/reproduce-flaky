Some minor fixups:

{code}
    For RIT Duration, do better than print ms/seconds. Remove redundant UI
    column dedicated to duration when we log it in the status field too.

    Make bypass log at INFO level -- when DEBUG we can miss important
    fixup detail like why we failed.

    Make it so on complete of subprocedure, we note count of outstanding
    siblings so we have a clue how much further the parent has to go before
    it is done (Helpful when hundreds of servers doing SCP).

    Have the SCP run the AP preflight check before creating an AP; saves
    creation of hundreds of thousands of APs during fixup of this big cluster
    of mine.

    Don't log tablename three times when reporting remote call failed.

    If lock is held already, note who has it. Also log after we get lock
    or if we have to wait rather than log on entrance though we may
    later have to wait (or we may have just picked up the lock).
{code}

Posting patch in a sec but let me try it on cluster too.
