HBASE-27313 introduced the ability to persist a list of hfiles for which prefetch has already been completed, so the we can avoid prefetching those files again in the event of a graceful restart, but it doesn't cover crash scenarios, as if the RS is killed or abnormally stopped, the list wouldn't be saved. 

This change aims to persist the list of already prefetched from a background thread that periodically checks cache state and persists the list if updates have happened.
