Porting one of our HBase cluster test tools (a single-process multi-threaded load generator and verifier) from 0.89-fb to trunk.
I cleaned up the code a bit compared to what's in 0.89-fb, and discovered that it has some features that I have not tried yet (some kind of a kill test, and some way to run HBase as multiple processes on one machine).
The main utility of this piece of code for us has been the HBaseClusterTest command-line tool (called HBaseTest in 0.89-fb), which we usually invoke as a load test in our five-node dev cluster testing, e.g.:

hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.manual.HBaseTest -load 1000000000:50:100:20 -tn load_test -read 1:1000000000:50:20 -zk <zk_quorum> -bloom ROWCOL -compression GZIP

I will be using this code to load-test the delta encoding patch and making fixes, but I am submitting the patch for early feedback. I will probably try out its other functionality and comment on how it works.
