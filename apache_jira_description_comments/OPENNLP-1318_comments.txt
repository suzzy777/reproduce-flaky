Review comment:
       I wonder if some of these tests could become flaky if there are internet connection issues in the client or the server side?

Review comment:
       I came looking at this class to check where the models were downloaded from, and to which folder on my computer. Maybe we could add a short Javadoc here, saying the models are downloaded from SourceForge, and are put in the `$USER/.opennlp` folder?

Review comment:
       I will add that. I'll update the user's guide, too.

Review comment:
       That's a good point. I'll see if I can make those integration tests that aren't run with every build.

Review comment:
       Good idea, or group them so that if one starts failing we can disable temporarily until whatever issue is fixed and they can be re-enabled.

Review comment:
       Updated and move those tests to *IT.java tests outside the regular build.

   These tests were moved to *IT.java files but not removed from the *Test.java files. They don't need to run during a regular build.
