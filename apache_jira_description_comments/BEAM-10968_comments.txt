These tests are three years old. Is this recently flakey or has been for a while?

I haven't seen this flake before, and the earliest failure on Jenkins is: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Commit/13555/testReport/org.apache.beam.sdk.metrics/MetricsTest$AttemptedMetricTests/testAttemptedDistributionMetrics/
which is dated: Sep 14, 2020 11:48:55 PM
but it's close to the oldest builds listed so it doesn't really say much about when the flake started.

[~kenn] - who could be a good person to investigate this issue?

Maybe [~ajamato@google.com] who has done some metrics work?

Saw this again here: https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Phrase/2939/testReport/junit/org.apache.beam.sdk.metrics/MetricsTest$AttemptedMetricTests/testAttemptedDistributionMetrics/

I reached out to [~ajamato@google.com] about this. He said he doesn't have time to take a look, but suggested [~pabloem] or [~chamikara] may be able to triage.

I have been looking for this issue for 2 continuous weeks and haven't find occurrences. Haven’t been able to reproduce it.
