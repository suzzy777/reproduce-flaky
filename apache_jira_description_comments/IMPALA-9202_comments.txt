IMPALA-9202: Fix flakiness in test_executor_groups

Some tests in test_executor_groups immediately tried fetching the query
profile after executing it asynchronously to verify if the query was
queued. However there is a small window between the exec rpc returning
and the query being queued during which the query profile does not
contain any info about the query being queued. This was causing some
asserts in the test to fail.
