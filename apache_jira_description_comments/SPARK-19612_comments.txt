I think this happens when Jenkins is quite busy; it probably isn't even a flaky test situation. That has been my experience.
Not that it isn't a problem but may not be due to a test per se.

Does that mean we could potentially fix this by limiting the concurrency on Jenkins? 

Closing this for now because I haven't seen this issue in a while (we can re-open if this starts occurring again)

This seems to be back: saw two recently:

https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/75124
https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/75127

And another: https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/75272/console

timeout was increased a while back!
