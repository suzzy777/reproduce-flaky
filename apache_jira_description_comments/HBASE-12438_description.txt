Tripped over this config today:

 -Dsurefire.rerunFailingTestsCount=

I made a test fail, then pass, and I got this output:

{code}
 Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Flakes: 1
{code}

Notice the 'Flakes' addition on the far-right.

Let me enable this on hadoopqa builds. Hopefully will help make it so new contribs are not frightened off by flakies thinking their patch the cause.
