This is super weird. Basically, it can fail in many of the tests, but the mode of failing is all the same. Recovery occurs, but then when it tries to verify it cannot connect to the replaced bookie. But the bookie is there. It fails on the PerChannelBookieClient connect, with a ClosedChannelException even though, noone has a reference to the channel to close it before this point (triggers in the channel future from the connect).

Problem was related to a change in netty,
https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/2a9c5efe8fc7eb3a18a2891dc4505a8cdf6f54c5
which came in when we upgraded to 4.2.9.Final.

This has been fixed in later releases,
https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/02be2523e0da44f5e0432146419056ec9609b6da
so upgrading netty.

Also, since the netty package groupId changed, it caused conflicts as
both io.netty:netty and org.jboss.netty:netty were being pulled in (the
latter transatively through zookeeper). The easy solution was to upgrade
to zookeeper 3.4.6 (latest stable), which has upgraded to use a
io.netty:netty release of netty anyhow.

It looks good, but I'm not sure about your choice of the netty version. This page:

http://netty.io/downloads.html

recommends 4.0.23 instead of 3.9.4, although the latter is also stable. Is it related to ZK?


Adding one thought: its good to check any compatibility issues between 4.x.x and 3.x.x. [netty backward compatiblity with older library|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21762694/netty-backward-compatiblity-with-older-library]

+1 for the patch. -1 for bumping to 4.x.x, since it would break backward compatibility. since it is end of the 4.3.0 release, we should not change major dependency.

if no objections over the weekend, I would commit this.

The bit that confused me is that in a comment from Ivan above, he says that that the problem was introduced when we upgraded to "4.2.9.Final", but this patch sets the netty version to 3.9.4. The discrepancy confused me.

I think '4.2.9.Final' is a typo. since the current netty version in bookkeeper is 3.2.9.Final.

{code}
<dependency>
      <groupId>org.jboss.netty</groupId>
      <artifactId>netty</artifactId>
      <version>3.2.9.Final</version>
      <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
{code}

OK, I'm +1 for this one then.
