This script could use general cleanup to adhere more closely to PEP-8.  Additionally:

* Team target should be parameterized
* The fetch limit for the initial build summary should be included in the GET if more than 100 builds are to be (initially) examined
* Perhaps optionally, reporting should be able to group by test class, method name (for those extending TestBase classes)
* Optionally, highlight / exclude those failures that resulted from a {{timeout exceeded}} failure.
