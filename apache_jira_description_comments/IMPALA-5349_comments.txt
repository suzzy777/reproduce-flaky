Marking as blocker until we understand how serious this is. Unfortunately the minidumps did not survive long enough for me to gather them.

The assertion in the test is incorrect - asynchronous I/Os are racing with the main test thread and if the I/Os win this happens.

The fix should be pretty easy but I'll downgrade since it's not a blocker.



The same test in BufferPoolTest doesn't have this bug because BufferPool::Unpin() doesn't return a Status :)


IMPALA-5349: flaky NoDirsAllocationError test

The assertion was incorrect and racy - it is ok if the write error wins
the race with the Unpin() calls, causing them to fail.
