I don't see a {{ClusterScheduler}} class on master -- was that refactored to {{TaskSchedulerImpl}}?

There is still a {{Thread.sleep(1000)}} in that class's {{stop()}} though, which may be what this ticket refers to: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1df05a40ebf3493b0aff46d18c0f30d2d5256c7b/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSchedulerImpl.scala#L399

It looks like this was added by [~mridulm@yahoo-inc.com] all the way back in 2013: https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/d90d2af1036e909f81cf77c85bfe589993c4f9f3#diff-4e188f32951dc989d97fa7577858bc7cR397

I'm merged [~boyork]'s PR into master and am going to monitor the pull request builder for a bit to see whether this change introduced any flakiness.  If not, I'd consider backporting this change into other branches in order to speed up the tests.

[~joshrosen] How is this PR holding up? I haven't seen any issues on the dev board. Think we can close this JIRA ticket? Trying to help prune the JIRA tree :)

[~srowen] [~joshrosen] bump on this. Would assume things are stable with the removal of the sleep method, but want to double check. Thinking we can close this ticket out.

[~joshrosen] would it be OK if I tried my hand at backporting into 1.2? further?

Backported to 1.2
