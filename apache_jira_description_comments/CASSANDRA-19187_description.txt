When assassinate an ip address that is not in the gossip map, a "corrupted" entry will be inserted into the gossip map. [(1)|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/gms/Gossiper.java#L810]

For example, if we do "nodetool assassinate 10.1.1.1"

we will get an entry like below by running "nodetool gossipinfo":

 
{code:java}
/10.1.1.1
  generation:1702006511
  heartbeat:9999
  STATUS:209516:LEFT,-8393921141401589197,1702265651923
  STATUS_WITH_PORT:209515:LEFT,-8393921141401589197,1702265651923
  TOKENS: not present {code}
 

This entry in endpointStateMap will cause issue for [isUpgradingFromVersionLowerThan|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/gms/Gossiper.java#L2284] function. Because the [upgradeFromVersionSupplier|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/gms/Gossiper.java#L191] supplier will always set the [allHostsHaveKnownVersion|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/gms/Gossiper.java#L216] flag to false so no memoized value will be returned. The "get" function will always require a lock from this [line|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/utils/ExpiringMemoizingSupplier.java#L66].

If application is using "fetchAll", the native-transport-requests thread will hit this [line|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/filter/ColumnFilter.java#L574]. This means all the native-transport-requests thread is serialized, also, the lock is shared by GossipStage threads. It means if a node in a cluster with the corrupted gossip map is restart, the node will run into this problem.

To fix the issue,
 # Why we want to add a dummy entry for nodetool assassinate if the endpoint is not in the map anymore. Should we do nothing or throw exception if the node is not in the gossip map anymore?
 # Before checking if a version is null, we should make sure the node is not a dead node. A decommissioned node, a left node should not be considered part of the cluster anymore when calculating "upgradeInProgressPossible"
