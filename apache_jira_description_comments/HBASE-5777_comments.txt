We have an hbase-site.xml at src/test that is used when we run tests.  It disables the UI.  You think we should apply this patch too Jimmy?

I see.  When I run unit tests in eclipse, the hbase-site.xml at src/test is not used.
Maybe we can disable the UI in MiniHBaseCluster too, how about that?

This patch doesn't hurt.  In eclipse, someone may want to check the UI sometimes.

Let me find a work-around instead of changing the code, which could affect other people who uses MiniHBaseCluster.
