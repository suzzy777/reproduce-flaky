    STORM-1746: Downgrade NOT_LEADER_FOR_PARTITION log to warn from error

    This error is transient most of the time and will occur during normal operation. Downgrading it to warning makes the error log much less noisy.

    Worker gets killed due to this error. It should be logged as error only.

    It should get caught here https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-kafka/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/kafka/KafkaSpout.java#L142 or here https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-kafka/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/kafka/trident/TridentKafkaEmitter.java#L78

    I see. Then we can remove this log itself since the same message is being logged again at https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-kafka/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/kafka/KafkaSpout.java#L143. 
    TridentKafkaSpout is swallowing up the exception. You can add the exception in the log there.

    This has the effect of downgrading all errors from fetch to warning level. Maybe the error log in KafkaUtils should be added back with a check for whether it's NOT_LEADER_FOR_PARTITION?

    Looks like a flaky test. Going to try again.

    I would still suggest to remove this log completely since we are refreshing for all such errors and a warning with the exception should suffice.

    Okay, will do.


Closing since it seems like this is a fairly irrelevant change to what is now legacy code.
