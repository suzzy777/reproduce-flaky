org.apache.zookeeper.test.LETest.testLE is failing on trunk once in a while. I'm not able to reproduce the failure on my box. I looked at the log, but I couldn't quite figure out what's going on.

Update:
======
Because LE is deprecated there is not much points on spending effort fixing it, as discussed in the JIRA. Updated JIRA title to reflect the state of the issue.
