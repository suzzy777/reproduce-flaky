This patch is in HADOOP cause its slightly wide/crossproject. Lemme know if I should split it though.

Changes summary:
* The NodeManager log (from where I noticed this first) showed this cause there was a hdfs-default.xml config set for this deprecated prop, and its web filter loaded that up. Cleaned up hdfs-default.xml.
* The old property lookup existed in JspHelper in HDFS. Changed that to use the new property.
* Cleaned up the usage of constants for this property, via CommonConfigurationKeys classes instead of its own constant refs.
* Added new prop and default to core-default.xml

bq. -1 findbugs. The patch appears to cause Findbugs (version 1.3.9) to fail.

Findbugs test-patch run seems to have issues with cross-module patches perhaps. I'm able to get perfect results from it via manual per-module exec:

(Is the build supposed to fail? Per the test-patch, that message is given when it returns non-zero results.)

bq. -1 javadoc. The javadoc tool appears to have generated 2 warning messages.

I ran {{mvn javadoc:javadoc}} manually on common, where I did include one javadoc change and the results indicate that the warning is from some other change:

{code}
2 warnings
[WARNING] Javadoc Warnings
[WARNING] /Users/harshchouraria/Work/code/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/conf/Configuration.java:334: warning - Tag @link: missing '#': "addDeprecation(String key, String newKey)"
[WARNING] /Users/harshchouraria/Work/code/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/conf/Configuration.java:285: warning - Tag @link: missing '#': "addDeprecation(String key, String newKey,
[WARNING] String customMessage)"
{code}

Probably HADOOP-8172 was the one that introduced these.

Hence, the -1s are both unrelated to my moderately trivial patch.

Filed HADOOP-8359 to address the javadocs.

Any further comments on the patch? Its quite trivial a change and helps remove unnecessary WARN noise.

Given this patch's trivialness (simple, non-breaking, should-have-done-way-before, change of old prop reliance across projects) I'll commit this in by Monday EOD if no one has any further objections.

Resubmitting patch pre-commit just to be sure about the Findbugs initialization issues.

Rebased the core-site.xml changes that caused the patch application to fail. The Auto-HA merge to trunk changed the core-site.xml leading to this.

Re-submmitting for another QA round before committing (for re-checking findbugs initialization fail, which doesn't occur locally).

Failing test {{org.apache.hadoop.fs.viewfs.TestViewFsTrash}} is unrelated to this change. Findbugs succeeded this time, so the previous issue was something else on trunk at the time or was a flaky result.
