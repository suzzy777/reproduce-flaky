When RMAppManager creates the RMApp object using the placementContext's results, it only uses the getQueue method which will return only the name of the leaf queue in the case of CapacityScheduler.

If a queue exists with this name, then the application will be placed into the queue. If the queue does not exists, then CS will take the parent path into consideration during the auto queue creation, however this only happens if there is no queue with the leaf name.
