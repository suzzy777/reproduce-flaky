[~chia7712] Sorry, I was not aware that you assigned this ticket to yourself. Could you please review the PR?

From [~cadonna] 's PR:

> In PR [#8962|https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8962] we introduced a sentinel UNKNOWN_OFFSET to mark unknown offsets in checkpoint files. The sentinel was set to -2 which is the same value used for the sentinel LATEST_OFFSET that is used in subscriptions to signal that state stores have been used by an active task. Unfortunately, we missed to skip UNKNOWN_OFFSET when we compute the sum of the changelog offsets.

> If a task had only one state store and it did not restore anything before the next rebalance, the stream thread wrote -2 (i.e., UNKNOWN_OFFSET) into the subscription as sum of the changelog offsets. During assignment, the leader interpreted the -2 as if the stream run the task as active although it might have run it as standby. This misinterpretation of the sentinel value resulted in unexpected task assigments.

This seems like a blocker to me, [~rhauch] , what do you think? The condition is that the streams assignor would unexpectedly move work to a node that's not ready, resulting in downtime while that node restores from the changelog.
