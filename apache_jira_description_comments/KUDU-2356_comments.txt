Seems the original commit made some tests flaky. Reverting until I have time to look at it.

Here is the original change that got reverted: https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/9747/

Re-merged asÂ a85c3302abf935457e4d0f9d5326f0b612e0b614. Watched over the flaky test dashboard and haven't seen anything surprising and WAL related in the past few days.

I put this on a tserver and the post-bootstrap memory usage went from 9.08GB to 5.55GB with the patch.
