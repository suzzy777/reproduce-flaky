@Wenchao I have assigned the Jira to you as you are already working on it.

[~1wc] I will review the code this week.

[~kalyan] Thank u very much!.

[~1wc] I tested the change locally. Test in class "TestPrivilegesAtFunctionScope" is failing with the new change.

[~kalyan] Hello!

I tested the change locally right now as `mvn test -Dtest=org.apache.sentry.tests.e2e.hive.TestPrivilegesAtFunctionScope`, and the test success as it did in the Jenkins console output([https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-SENTRY-Build/4432/console]).
{code:java}

{code}
Maybe you can try it again, thanks!!!

Hello [~kalyan], I wonder whether this patch could be committed. Did the test succeed in the end?

Test could me a flaky one. Will look into this today and try to merge it as well.

Thanks for your contribution.
