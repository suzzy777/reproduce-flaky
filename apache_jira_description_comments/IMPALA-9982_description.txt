The end-to-end test of [test_dateless_timestamp_text|https://github.com/apache/impala/master/tests/query_test/test_scanners.py#L1248-L1258] ([https://github.com/apache/impala/master/testdata/workloads/functional-query/queries/QueryTest/dateless_timestamp_text.test]) failed in a recent build.

Since the test was recently added by [~tadam] in [IMPALA-9531|https://gerrit.cloudera.org/c/15866/], maybe [~tadam] could provide some insight into it. Thanks!
