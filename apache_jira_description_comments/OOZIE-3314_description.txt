In oozie-core, we have a file called "findbugs-filter.xml" which tells findbugs that it shluld ignore certain problems in a couple of classes.

However if we try to compile a sub-module or run findbugs directly (let's say in a sharelib project), the build will fail because it won't be able to open findbugs.xml. It's not straightforward how to define the path of the XML in a way that it makes this xml accessible regardless of what module you're compiling.

It's better to just convert its contents to annotations - especially since we already use this method too.
