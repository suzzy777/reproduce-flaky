org.apache.ignite.IgniteCheckedException: Cannot find metadata for object with compact footer: -1058754203
Caused by: org.apache.ignite.binary.BinaryObjectException: Cannot find metadata for object with compact footer: -1058754203

I was thinking that it can be fixed by adding ignite.binary().type(Person.class) before doing query, but it appears to be not the case.
