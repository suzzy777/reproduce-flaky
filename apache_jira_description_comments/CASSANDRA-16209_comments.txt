[~dcapwell] It looks like we've seen that test fail before [here|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-15984?focusedCommentId=17165894&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17165894]?

You mean https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra/705/workflows/e53c72aa-dc4c-4dcc-811d-87aedd75f89a/jobs/3931 consistency_test.py::TestConsistency::test_12872?

I remember this test class failing but didn't check if there was a jira; took the fact it passed in the other version to tell me it was flaky.
