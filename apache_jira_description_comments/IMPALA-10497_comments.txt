I'm able to reproduce this test failure after several retry. Still not sure what is the root cause of this flakiness though.
I'll try to increase the sleep time and see if the flakiness is gone.

The reason for the test flakiness is that data-cache is not fully warmed up. Not all data being read in data-cache, therefore a new hdfs fd is opened and cached.

I submitted a patch to fix this to gerrit.Â

IMPALA-10497: Fix flakiness in test_no_fd_caching_on_cached_data.

test_no_fd_caching_on_cached_data has been flaky for not having all of
the data fully cached in the warm-up phase. There is a limit on
concurrency in writing to the cache such that we may fail to cache data
the first time read it. This patch fixes the test by repeating the
warm-up query 5 times. This patch also add a proper start_args to the
test so that each impalad will write their data cache file in their own
directory.

Testing:
- Loop the test manually 100 times and see no more failures.
