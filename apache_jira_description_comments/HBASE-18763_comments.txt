probably this also impacts branch-2, but I haven't chased it down.

confirmed this is also in the branch-2 nightly runs

I hope to find the time to pick this up tmrw. Will self-assign when I actually start investigating.

I'm pretty sure I knocked this out in HBASE-18807

Should be addressed via HBASE-18807
