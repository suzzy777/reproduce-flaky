We should have a nightly test that runs if there are changes to

* top level pom
* any of the hbase-shaded-* modules

That test should grab the current HEAD of a configurable branch of the main repo (which defaults to the repo's default branch, currently master) and then attempt a build + tests while setting {{hbase-thirdparty.version}} to the in-progress SNAPSHOT build. The test run should exclude the current set of flaky tests.
