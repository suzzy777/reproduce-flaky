Dump planner output at higher log level in some log file for more detailed information. 

During loading when computing stats the following output appears:

{code}
00:34:45.382 Executing: compute stats tpcds.store_sales
00:34:45.382   -> Updated 0 partition(s) and 22 column(s).
{code}

However, it looks like for all other tables at least one partition is updated.

I think, I found the issue: When we reload the Hive Snapshot, somehow the metadata of the tables seems not to be correct. When we compute stats after loading the metadata snapshot, it seems like its not correct. An easy workaround could be to make sure we drop the stats before loading them.

Also seen here on another set of queries in the PlannerTest (not TPC-DS):

Last seen on Aug. Closing it for now and will reopen if it shows up again.
