I wrote a function that obtained a dlock and then performed a transaction.  It always operates on the same dlock key and the same keys in my region.  That protects against getting a commit conflict exception BUT this sometimes fails if the JVM holding the lock crashes.  One of the functions appears to get the dlock okay but then its transaction fails when it goes to commit.
