    SAMZA-1047: testEndOfStreamWithOutOfOrderProcess is flaky

    Chooser always pools end of stream message until final callback is trigered so process-enelopes metrics didn't match. Changed the test methods to return null envelopes after end of stream message.
    
    Deleted unused boolean variable "completed" in AsyncTaskWorker
