Add @Override.

Agreed, I will do that on commit. Are you +1 otherwise?

+1

I think I added heapsize method to Mutation when I made Increment a Mutation; didn't add the interface because wasn't sure it was needed generally.

Increment inherits heapSize() from Mutation.
Increment has a field of TimeRange which is not accounted for in Mutation#heapSize()

Should we account for this field in Increment#heapSize() ?

[~ted_yu] Not in this patch.

I was trying to find a generic way to get the size of an object. A google search on this leads to quite a lot of  terrible practises :-). It should be possible to do a static{} block for the fixed fields, but it won't bring much actual value. With the current implementation, it's better to have unit tests when ones adds fields. I'm going to do this in this patch (including Increment) it will be simpler.

There is an issue: with the unit tests, I've got a huge gap I do not explain:

Expected :80
Actual   :168

Any hint?

Try using -d32 flag locally.  Jenkins seems to do 32bit java.

Oh, this is just locally, no jenkins involved?  You using ClassSize.align?

Yes, just locally (I do test before submitting :-) ) I used ClassSize.align for timerange, and it went ok. But for Put/Delete/Increment, There are 88 bytes of difference I cannot explain. The code is on the v2.patch.

Patch v3 makes TestHeapSize pass.

Put has already been covered in TestHeapSize#testSizes()

Thanks a lot Ted. For v4 I've just moved the test 'Put' with the other tests. I will commit as soon as I get a +1.

There was a javadoc warning. 

Please fix. 

Other than that, +1. 

bq. There was a javadoc warning. 
Right. I'm going to hunt it.

v5 is what I will commit if the build runs ok.

This seems to prove that we're in the usual flakiness (thanks for having relaunched the tests, Ted). Committed to trunk and 0.95.

Thanks for the review, Stack & Ted!
