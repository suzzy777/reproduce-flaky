When writing new pytests or modifying existing pytests there are frequently questions and uncertainties regarding the behavior of pytest + xdist with respect to:
* Concurrency behavior. What is safe and what is unsafe for tests parallelized with xdist.
* How many class instances does xdist generate?
* How does the number of workers relate to the number class instances (are they independent?)
* What are the guarantees with respect to Impala's test dimensions? Will all test vectors for a single test be run (1) on the same class instance? (2) by the same worker? How does it all fit together?
* Setup/teardown behavior. How often will the pytest setup and teardown methods be executed (both the @classmethod and non-classmethod ones).
* How many Impala clients will a test generate when parallelized with xdist?

These uncertainties have lead to a variety of poorly authored flaky tests.

As far as I can tell, the existing documentation on pytest and xdist does not address our the above concerns specifically. I also did some experimentation and was very surprised by the behavior.

The goal here is to fully understand and clearly document (in the code, e.g., tests/run-tests.py) the behavior of pytest + xdist for our purposes.
