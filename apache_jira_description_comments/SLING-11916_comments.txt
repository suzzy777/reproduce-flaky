My hunch was incorrect - https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-testing-osgi-mock/pull/28 so I won't pursue this any further. If anyone wants to try and fix this, please do.

i enabled debug logging in the PR for the unit tests, but all tests are green. so it seems this test is basically flaky, it does not fail always (on my local machine it fails only very rarely).

Maybe the Windows VMs are simply slower/more loaded compared to the Linux VMs, leading to more frequent timeouts?

maybe yes - on the other side the timeout is already configured to 3000ms - for a operation that usually should take only a few ms. and there is no I/O involved in the unit test.
so it seems unlikely that an environment which is 50%-100% slower or so this leads to such a drastic increase.

the latest builds i observed did run fine in the CI - removing the next version from the ticket

it happens again quite regularly on the CI with windows an java 17 (not reproducible locally...)
we need to look into it.

[~sseifert] I was able to trace this locally and in [Jenkins|https://ci-builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Sling%2Fmodules%2Fsling-org-apache-sling-testing-osgi-mock/detail/PR-34/1/pipeline] after adding logging and moving the assertion into the DummyEventHandler class so the failed condition could be examined when it occurred. Then I just ran it a bunch until it failed. When it did fail, this log message was repeated until the timeout, which points to out-of-order delivery of EVENT_SAMPLE_2, and EVENT_OTHER_3:

 
{code:java}
[Time-limited test] ERROR org.apache.sling.testing.mock.osgi.MockEventAdminTest - missed expectations [org.osgi.service.event.Event [topic=sample/topic2] {}, org.osgi.service.event.Event [topic=other/topic3] {}] received [org.osgi.service.event.Event [topic=other/topic3] {}, org.osgi.service.event.Event [topic=sample/topic2] {}] {code}
According to [https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.event.html#i1556001] the default async delivery behavior should be ordered, rather than each event being delivered on its own thread as [MockEventAdmin|https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-testing-osgi-mock/blob/907dbbd5e6707b6be5f19f8af6dedcd6cdf2f87d/core/src/main/java/org/apache/sling/testing/mock/osgi/MockEventAdmin.java#L74-L91] is currently doing:

 
{code:java}
    @Override
    public void postEvent(final Event event) {
        if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
            log.debug("Send event: {}, bundleContext={}", event.getTopic(), this.bundleContext);
        }
        try {
            asyncHandler.execute(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    distributeEvent(event);
                }
            });
        }
        catch (RejectedExecutionException ex) {
            // ignore
            log.debug("Ignore rejected execution: " + ex.getMessage(), ex);;
        }
    } {code}
 

 

great [~madamcin], thanks for finding the root cause!

for fixing i've gone the simple way and switched to a single threaded executor which should be sufficient and easier to manage for the unit test scenario. i've run the full CI tests on jenkins five times and they always did pass.
