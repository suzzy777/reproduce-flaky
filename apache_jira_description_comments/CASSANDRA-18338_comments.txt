The failure can be reproduced on CircleCI with:
{code}
.circleci/generate.sh -p \
  -e REPEATED_JVM_DTESTS=org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.ByteBuddyExamples#countTest \
  -e REPEATED_JVM_DTESTS_COUNT=10000
{code}
* https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2816/workflows/8f6cff1c-e36b-4a67-a608-0baf72c6348a
* https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/2816/workflows/b59962c9-4fc4-45bc-b1dd-727c7d4c2986

Flakiness on CircleCI according to those runs seems to be 0.015%, so very unlikely to fail. That contrasts with the observed flakiness on Jenkins, which is between 14% and 44%, depending on the run.

[~bereng] the patch is [this PR|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/2482] for 4.1, right?

Oh yes. How weird I have been seeing PR auto linked into the tickets and the first time I don't do it it doesn't auto link it for me...

Maybe it's because the PR name contains a whitespace instead of a hyphen between `Cassandra` and `18338`?

The patch looks good to me. I have started a repeated run for trunk: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/3019/workflows/0426f018-b833-4494-8928-ea027edf6827

[~adelapena] thanks for going the extra mile but that run failed, if my bisect is correct, bc of CASSANDRA-18133. I have pushed a new trunk PR from the previous SHA and fired a new CI. Fingers crossed this time.

The new trunk CI run is [green|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/1011/workflows/a5c9d774-2046-4ba9-be95-30428d5993d1/jobs/22742]

Looks good to me, +1.
