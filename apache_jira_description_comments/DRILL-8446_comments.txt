   # [DRILL-8446](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-8446):  Incorrect use of OperatingSystemMXBean
   
   ## Description
   
   Simplify CpuGaugeSet fixing the non-Sun/Oracle code path in the process.
   
   Even though code to handle non-Sun/Oracle runtimes for the OperatingSystemMXBean was present, it would still cause them to attempt to load a class from com.sun.management causing a NoClassDefFoundError.
