Looking back at this later we can't seem to find the original failure in concourse or in the CIO dashboard. Closing this story for now, if the problem re-appears we should open in again.

I just bumped into this, too, with the same stacktrace.

GEODE-6422: Fix test timeout issue (#3223)

This test was timing out when run in CI. Since it never fails locally,
the issue appears to be with resource contention. Increasing the timeout
should reduce the frequency of failures as it gives the test more time
to spin up the required threads. This test will still fail if it fails
to start two threads within a minute.

GEODE-6479 and GEODE-6422: remove tests (#3271)

Removing non-deterministic unit tests because unit tests should be
deterministic, and the tests were testing test code, not product code.
