The error occur when there is 1 sec different between saving expected and actual.

I think you nailed it [~samabcde]Â 

The test writes first to one stream, then to the next one. And every time it writes to the stream the Properties object keep track of the time it was updated. The .toByteArray() output will contain this time, which may vary since the two streams are written separately.

I reproduced it with the debugger, pausing for a few moments before the second stream is used.

Let me see if I can re-write this test so that it doesn't happen anymore. It's also using the deprecated .save(), I'll replace it by .store().

Thank you!
