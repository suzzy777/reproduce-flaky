Removed Fix Version 2.2.1 as this issue is not blocking that release.

Since this is not a blocker issue, as part of the 2.6.0 release process I'm changing the fix version to `2.6.1` and `2.7.0`. If this is incorrect, please respond and discuss on the "[DISCUSS] Apache Kafka 2.6.0 release" discussion mailing list thread.

Since this is not a blocker, there is no active PRÂ  I'm clearing the "fix version" field as part of the 2.7.0 release process.

i have problems, i have tests for my cluster where topics are deleted and then recreated and then testing input/output messages and test are quite often failing. Usually when this happens, i try to delete topics manually but i get response that topics is already scheduled for deletion, but even after waiting for quite a long time topics didn't delete. After i restart controller topics got deleted.
