This is very similar to the stack traces from the GitHub Actions failures (see https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/runs/1796674740#step:7:1306 for an example). It's nice to know that it doesn't only occur on GitHub Actions, but also occasionally happens on Jenkins. That implies that once it's fixed for Jenkins, it should work on GitHub Actions, and those builds will become a lot more useful in detecting new failures.
