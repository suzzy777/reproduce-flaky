hadoop-ozone/dev-support/checks directory contains multiple helper script to execute different type of testing (findbugs, rat, unit, build).

They easily define how tests should be executed, with the following contract:

 * The problems should be printed out to the console

 * in case of test failure a non zero exit code should be used

 

The tests are working well (in fact I have some experiments with executing these scripts on k8s and argo where all the shell scripts are executed parallel) but we need some update:

 1. Most important: the unit tests and integration tests can be separated. Integration tests are more flaky and it's better to have a way to run only the normal unit tests

 2. As HDDS-1115 introduced a pom.ozone.xml it's better to use them instead of the magical "am pl hadoop-ozone-dist" trick--

 3. To make it possible to run blockade test in containers we should use - T flag with docker-compose

 4. checkstyle violations are printed out to the console
