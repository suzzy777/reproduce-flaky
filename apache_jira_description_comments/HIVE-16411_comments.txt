I can take this up, I don't think it should be a straight {{git revert}} of HIVE-15199 though, there were some useful updates to some qtests in that JIRA. I will revert some of the additional logic added to {{Hive#mvFile}} since its no longer necessary.

Thanks for taking this up.

Pushed to master. Thanks, Sahil!

[~ashutoshc], the commit to master omitted the JIRA number.  Please update errata.txt for commit c98ee5b757e5dca136eb8269ac9b58a385428bb4.  Thanks.

Example of updating errata.txt:  HIVE-11876. 

Thanks Ashutosh!

I meant to post an update last night, but the tests are flaky:

HIVE-16467 - TestCliDriver.testCliDriver[vector_order_null]
HIVE-16481 - TestMiniLlapCliDriver.testCliDriver[orc_llap_counters1]
HIVE-15776 - TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver.testCliDriver[vector_if_expr]

All the blobstore tests pass when run locally against S3

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
