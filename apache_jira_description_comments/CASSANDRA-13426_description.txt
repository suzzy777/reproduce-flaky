A follow-up to CASSANDRA-9425 and a pre-requisite for CASSANDRA-10699.

It's necessary for the latter to be able to apply any DDL statement several times without side-effects. As part of the ticket I think we should also clean up validation logic and our error texts. One example is varying treatment of missing keyspace for DROP TABLE/INDEX/etc. statements with IF EXISTS.
