The testEntrySet() function (org.apache.commons.collections4.map.Flat3MapTest#testEntrySet) is flaky because it uses a flaky helper function putAndRemove(). The helper function wrongly assumes that map iterators execute in insertion order, while in fact it can be any order. 

The current test asserts the last element iterated (and subsequently removed) is the last element inserted. Therefore, the test passes when it so happens that the last iterated element is the last inserted element, but fails otherwise. 

 

The proposed fix is: https://github.com/apache/commons-collections/pull/189
