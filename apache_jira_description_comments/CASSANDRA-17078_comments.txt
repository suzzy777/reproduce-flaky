Got a prelim branch [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...josh-mckenzie:cassandra-17078?expand=1] that does a few things in SSTableReaderTest:
1. Removes duplication on the CF SSTable discarding at the start of many tests
2. Isolates the test w/the intermittent failure in circle to its own CF instead of sharing w/other tests
3. Isolates the test that has a couple potentially troublesome calls (.deleteOnExit, etc) that may be leading to ordering and timing issues between tests.

A lot of these tests are mucking around directly with SSTable files, deleting things, moving things, deleting directories and files with hooks, you name it. A lot of stuff that's risky when it comes to consistency if the parallelization of your test running infra doesn't have deterministic test ordering. 

Not sure if I can repro the original problem locally; going to give it a solid soak and if it doesn't repro try it on circle for a multiplex run as well.

The changes LGTM, +1

Should we backport them to 4.0 and 3.x branches? 

{{You missed removing store.discardSSTables(System.currentTimeMillis()); in }}{{{}testGetPositionsForRanges{}}}.  Otherwise LGTM.

I'll take a look; if the tests isn't flaking out there I'd say we hold off and I'll just keep an eye on it and backport if it starts to misbehave later. edit: shows up on 4.0. I'll target 4.0.x and 4.x with this.

Good catch.

Committed to 4.0 and trunk.
