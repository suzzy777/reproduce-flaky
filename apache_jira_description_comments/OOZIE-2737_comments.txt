The [sleep before assert|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/sharelib/streaming/src/test/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/TestMapReduceActionExecutor.java#L141] makes test case flaky. Solution is to replace sleep by waitFor with a predicate.

[~satishsaley] thanks for the patch! Could you please extract the {{waitFor()}} blocks to a method so that it won't be duplicated? Maybe extract the {{Predicate}} to a static nested class for documentation reasons.

Hi Andras,
Thank you for review. I created a method for {{waitFor()}}. But implementation of {{Predicate}} would be different for different tests , not a good idea to have class. 

Hi [~gezapeti],
I saw you fixing flaky tests having {{sleep}}. Would you also take  a look this patch? 

[~satishsaley] +1 (non-binding)

+1 (nonbinding), Thanks for the patch! It's always good to see {{sleep}} calls replaced.


+1. Committed to master. Thank you [~andras.piros] and [~gezapeti] for reviewing the patch. Thank you  [~satishsaley] for fixing the issue.

Closing issue; Oozie 5.0.0-beta1 is released
