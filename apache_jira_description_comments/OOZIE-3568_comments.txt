[~kmarton] ,Hi. Can you help me confirm this issue is a problem or not? Why we delete this class before? Maybe we need to delete this class's test class

[~nobigo] I think this is a valid issue. 
 Those files were removed with OOZIE-1463. I didn't found any explanation related the reason of keeping them in persistence.xml, so I think that this change is OK. Also I think that we should remove the test classes as well, if they don't have any added value.

[~nobigo] can you please check what exactly are those classes testing and check if they can be removed as well, or we should keep those.

Since the proposed changes are in persistence.xml, the precommit check fails at backwards compatibility part. However I don't think that this should be a problem, since there were invalid references. [~asalamon74] what is you opinion about this?

[~nobigo] This is definitely a valid issue, nice find.

[~kmarton] Although I also don't like the "-1 BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY" in the precommit result I agree that we wont have a problem, since those parts are referring to non-existent classes.

The test classes are a bit tricky. Originally {{TestJsonWorkflowJob}} was testing {{JsonWorkflowJob}}. After OOZIE-1463 it's testing {{WorkflowJobBean}}, so the name of the class is quite misleading. If we really want to test {{WorkflowJobBean}} we should have a {{TestWorkflowJobBean}}. [~nobigo] Can you please check the test classes and find out what classes they are really testing. I think we could keep most of them after a few renames.

[~asalamon74],Hi,I have checked the test classes and you are right,This class have a misleading name,I have changed This class name to the right meaning.

[~asalamon74]. Hi, I think this patch is good. Maybe this patch can't handle rename file correct？ So can you tell me how to make a right patch for this issue? Thank you very much.

Have you tried to apply your patch to the master branch? I've got the following error message:
{noformat}
$ git apply -p0 ~/Downloads/OOZIE-3568-004.patch 
error: core/src/test/java/org/apache/oozie/client/rest/TestCoordinatorActionBean.java: No such file or directory
error: core/src/test/java/org/apache/oozie/client/rest/TestCoordinatorJobBean.java: No such file or directory
error: core/src/test/java/org/apache/oozie/client/rest/TestWorkflowActionBean.java: No such file or directory
error: core/src/test/java/org/apache/oozie/client/rest/TestWorkflowJobBean.java: No such file or directory {noformat}

It's definitely caused by the file renames. Maybe you need to use additional options ({{-M}} ??) for git diff.

[~asalamon74],Hi . I can't make a correct patch for this issue, this git diff parameter can't work. I have try a lot times，It all doesn't work

[~nobigo], how did you renamed your file? Using git -mv, or simply renamed it?

[~kmarton], I have try this parameter, It can't work.Can we use two patch for this issue?
