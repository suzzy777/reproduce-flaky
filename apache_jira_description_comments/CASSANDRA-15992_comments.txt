I have an environment that produced the error every 100 runs or so, but it is not deterministic. The assertion is failing because we're sometimes not arriving in [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/service/reads/ShortReadPartitionsProtection.java#L151] for one of two SRP iterators created for this query (one per node). The only way I can see for this to happen is for results iteration to stop before exhausting both.

My current working theory is that this is possible, and okay due to [concurrency|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/614d7d06f4964f03681e9e90d98ddf3562c47598/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/service/StorageProxy.java#L2126-L2141], [potential variation|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/614d7d06f4964f03681e9e90d98ddf3562c47598/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/locator/ReplicaPlans.java#L616-L635] in replica iteration, and the potential to [stop|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/614d7d06f4964f03681e9e90d98ddf3562c47598/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/transform/BasePartitions.java#L93] inner iteration early when [limits are in play|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/b00d0c310ff61d3f39c116daeccdf43aa63f2b25/consistency_test.py#L1281]. Sadly I have not once been able to reproduce this with any instrumentation in the code whatsoever.

Having stalled progress on empirical observation, I wanted to float this static analysis for some discussion. If it holds water, the change would be to simply update the test to only require that SRP counter be at least the value of one of the node ranges (4 or 5).

Any thoughts on this analysis, [~aleksey]?

Hmh. Frankly, we can just ditch that assertion. The important part of that regression test is the query returning a correct resultset, which it does now, with C* fix in, and wouldn't without. In retrospect that last assert feels to me like an overspecification.

Thanks. Will do.

[a very predictable patch|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/compare/master...aholmberg:CASSANDRA-15992?expand=1]
[ci|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/aholmberg/cassandra?branch=CASSANDRA-15992] with several unrelated errors.

Committed.
