[~GuruStron] [~isapego] PR is ready for preliminary review:

* Feature core is ready and covered with tests (configuration, updates, expiration, invalidation)
* Put/Get and a few more cache operations are ready. Others are in progress.
* Please ignore missing xmldoc and other minor things for now

[~GuruStron] [~isapego] ready for final review, please have a look.

[~ptupitsyn] looks good to me
