Thanks for creating this issue.
I saw attached mockup and it looks good functionality to have.

How about introduce filters?
For example,
  - 'Running' : Show notebooks have running / pending status
  - 'Finished' : Notebooks not included in 'Running' list
  - 'Scheduled' : Cron scheduler enabled notebooks.
  - '[interpreter setting]' : Notebook binded to specific interpreter setting

In a UI side, how about make UI component more compact? i.e. less margines, less spaces, smaller font.
So more information can be displayed in a screen without scrolling the page. This will help get an at a glance view of running jobs.


thank you.
First, I will create a new Mockup Image collect your opinions.
Please check whether this is the same as you think.

And I'll add the Title related to the content of Paragraph.

Please check the new Job Menu.
1. Compact table form of representation.
2. Paragraph represented only running.
3. Interpreter instance sensitive.
4. Filter added.

If new feedback, I will implement in the form of the now.
Thank you.

New Mockup (file: mockup4.png)

Job management.
Mockup was created according to the new opinion.
1. Modify the first Mockup1.
2. Additional Paragraph Status Filter.

When there are no further comments, I will implement this Mockup.
https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12779588/Mockup4.png

mockup4 looks cool

Thank you, I will start working.

Great mockups, thank you for sharing!

In my understanding, as every job represents a Paragraph, job management is tied to the Note versioning (state of the paragraph output on every run).

My question is whether it is something you plan to take into account as part of this proposal?



Thanks for creating this issue. We have had incidents where many hive interpreter queries don't get out of "pending" state. We are running ParallelScheduler with maxConcurrency of 50. It would be great to have an interface where we can see what queries are running and pending.

Chae-Sung Lim, Any updates on this?

Sorry to those waiting for this.
I was not working on this issue so far.
But it will soon go back to work.
Sorry again.

Chae-Sung Lim, Do you have any updates?

    We can't have the front-end call for refresh every x seconds, only the server should be sending that event to us through websocket.

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1716
  
    @cloverhearts thank you for contribution! In my experience, if PR author or one of reviewers post the reason for CI failure - that speeds up the review\merge process dramatically.
    
    CI is failing with flaky pySpark tests, not relevant to the PR
    
    ```
    Results :
    
    Failed tests: 
      ZeppelinSparkClusterTest.pySparkDepLoaderTest:430 expected:<FINISHED> but was:<ERROR>
      ZeppelinSparkClusterTest.pySparkAutoConvertOptionTest:312 expected:<FINISHED> but was:<ERROR>
    
    Tests run: 82, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1
    ```
    
    It will be handled under [ZEPPELIN-1761](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1761).
    
    \cc @felizbear to review the frontend part.

    @cloverhearts can you please rebase it on latest master - `git rebase master` and force push it? This will trigger CI with latest fixes and help to see if there are any relevant failures here.
