IMPALA-9008: Serialize Maven invocations to deflake impala-minimal-hive-exec

Building impala-minimal-hive-exec was flaky (sometimes it failed
to download Guava 14.0.1), and my guess is that it is related to
downloading the same dependency in parallel with ext-data-source.

Similarly to the solution in IMPALA-7051, I try to fix it by
adding a fictional dependency (ext-data-source -> shaded-deps)
to serialize the build.

Full Maven dependency graph:
fe -> yarn-extras -> ext-data-source -> shaded-deps -> impala-parent
The ordering of yarn-extras, ext-data-source, and shaded-deps are
arbitrary.

Testing:
- I never reproduced the original flakiness, so I just hope
  that it disappears with this change.

I didn't see the issue since the change went in, so I hope that it is fixed.

A similar build error occured with query-event-hook-api.
A similar fix is uploaded for review: https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/14423/

IMPALA-9008: Serialize Maven invocations to deflake query-event-hook-api

The previous commit for this Jira serialized the compilation of
shaded-deps and ext-data-source to fix flakiness. It looks like
this led to a new similar issue related to the parallel compilation
of ext-data-source and query-event-hook-api.

Similarly to the shaded-deps issue, I try to fix this by adding a
fictional dependency (query-event-hook-api -> yarn-extras) to serialize
the build.

Full Maven dependency graph:
fe -> query-event-hook-api -> yarn-extras -> ext-data-source ->
     shaded-deps-> impala-parent
The ordering of query-event-hook-apit, yarn-extras, ext-data-source,
and shaded-deps are arbitrary.
