    Fixed flakiness in MasterAllocatorTest.ResourcesUnused.

    In the test, `sched1` registers with the master and launches a task on
    half the resources it is offered. Then `sched2` registers and should be
    offered the remaining resources. The problem is that, because the test
    did not pause the clock, a batch allocation might occur between the
    first task launch and the second scheduler registering. The test tried
    to account for this (by having `sched1` decline any additional offers it
    receives), but this was not done correctly: declining the offer will
    result in calling `recoverResources` again, which the test did not
    account for.

    Seems simpler to instead pause the clock, which should prevent the
    possibility of a batch allocation in the first place.
