TestStore.testDeleteExpiredStoreFiles relies on wall clock time, if there is a blip on the machine running the test, first compaction might be delayed enough in order to compact away multiple of the files, and have the test fail.

The simplest fix is to just double the time given from 1s/file to 2s/file.
