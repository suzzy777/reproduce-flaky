[~janhoy] - Consideration for 9.0?

I think it belongs in 9.0, since the smoketester runs integration tests, and if we want the smoke test to fail on errors in integration tests, then guess we need this. But I'm not sure how stable we consider these integration tests? Is there a separate Jira to fix the failing integration test? I've seen it fail too.

I don't have a great sense of what caused the original failure in the first place, so I can't confidently claim to have fixed it. This does address at least a little bit of the flakiness from setup/teardown that could have been contributing to the failure (there seems to have been a slight race with how we wanted to wait for Solr to start up and how the test framework would accept us doing so).

I'll try beasting this as best as I can to see what I can shake out.

Going to leave this until 9.1 since I don't want to rush on covering up the root cause of the test failures (are they real or are they flaky)
