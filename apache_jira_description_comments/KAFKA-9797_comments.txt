URL: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8403
 
 
   In order to perform non-disruptive update of inter-broker listener to a different security protocol, we need to first ensure that the listener is enabled on all brokers. Once the listener is available on all brokers, inter-broker listener can be updated using rolling update.
