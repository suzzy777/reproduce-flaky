Note: after the implementation is complete, remove this part from the converter tool ([https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/converter/FSQueueConverter.java#L83-L94])

      String shortName = getQueueShortName(queueName);
      if (!leafQueueNames.add(shortName)) {
        throw new ConversionException(
            "Leaf queues must be unique, "
                + shortName + " is defined at least twice");
      }
    }
   ...{noformat}

I have read through the design document and was wondering if we cannot take a far simpler approach.

If we simply relax the rule that the leaf queue must be unique in the system in favour of the fact that a queue must be unique based on the full queue path. This does not break existing configurations as the unique leaf queue is also unique when you take into account the whole path. That means there is nothing for the current clusters that needs to change. Internally the scheduler does have to change to make sure that all references use the queue path. This will require a lot of changes throughout the scheduler when you look up a queue and the way we store the reference if it is not directly to the leaf queue. 

The only other point that we need to correctly handle this now is on the submit side. This must be handled backward compatible. We have two cases to handle: just a queue name and a queue path. I'll discuss updating  the configuration is later.

# When an application is submitted with just a queue name (not a path) we expect that the name is a unique leaf queue name. If that queue does not exist or is not uniquely identifiable we reject the application submission. Resolution of the real leaf queue follows the same steps as it does now. The queue name in the end is converted to the correct leaf queue identified by the a path. For existing configurations nothing has changed. Internally we hide all the changes.
# When the submit has a queue path (fully qualified or not) we check that the queue exists based on that path. If the leaf queue is not defined using its path the application submission is rejected. 

In the case that the scheduler has a non unique leaf queue name submitting to those queues can only be done by using their paths. There is nothing that needs to be configured to switch this behaviour on or off.

The important part is applying a new configuration. If the configuration adds a leaf queue that is not unique the configuration update currently is rejected. With this change we would allow that config to become active. This *could* break existing applications when they try to submit to the leaf queue that is no longer unique.
We should at least log and warn clearly in the response of the update. Maybe even show it in the UI or we could ask for a confirmation. The first update that adds a non unique queue to the configuration should always fail complaining loudly. It should then keep warning the user and rejecting the update unless a confirmation flag is set to force the update through. After the first update that would not be needed anymore.
Reading a config from a file or store which is used to initialise the scheduler should not trigger such behaviour. We still should show a warning in the logs to make sure it is not lost.

What do you think about this approach?

[~wilfreds] based on your suggestion, here's what I came up with:

We can still maintain the HashMap with queueName->CSQueue, however we'd use two levels:
 1. Leaf queue -> full path
 2. Full path -> CSQueue object

We additionally need an extra map which tells whether a leaf queue is unique.

So after some thinking, this is the semi-pseudocode that could possibly do the job:
{noformat}
Map<String, CSQueue> fullPathQueues;
Map<String, String> leafToFullPath;
Map<String, Boolean> leafUnique;

public CSQueue getQueue(String queueName) {
  if (fullPathName(queueName)) {
    return fullPathQueues.get(queueName);
  } else {
    if (leafUnique.get(queueName)) {
      String fullName = leafToFullPath.get(queueName);
      return fullPathQueues.get(fullName);
    } else {
      throw new YarnException(queueName + " is not unique");
    }
  } 
}
{noformat}
Obviously methods like {{addQueue()}}, {{removeQueue()}} should be updated too.

Alternatively, we can have {{Map<String, CSQueue> fullToCSQueue}} and {{Map<String, CSQueue> leafToCSQueue}}, so we can avoid the double lookup (not that it's really that expensive).

Also it's probably better to have {{Map<String, Integer>}} to check whether a leaf is unique. When we add/remove a queue, we increase/decrease a counter, so upon removal, we know whether it has became unique or not.

[~pbacsko], thanks for working on the design. 

In general, I agree with what [~wilfreds] mentioned: we should try to avoid change RPC protocols, instead we just change internal logic to make sure multiple queues can be handled.

To me there're two major parts:

1) Whatever logic inside CS to allow multiple queue names. Either solution mentioned in the comment: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-9879?focusedCommentId=17009845&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17009845 should be fine. And I expect the lookup of queue name (not queue path) should only be called when submit application.

And once application is submitted to CS, internal to CS, we should make sure we use queue path instead of queue name at all other places. Otherwise we will complicate other logics.

2) When submit app, the scheduler going to accept/reject app based on the uniqueness of queue name or path specified. The core part need to be changed is inside RMAppManager:
{code:java}
 if (!isRecovery && YarnConfiguration.isAclEnabled(conf)) {
  if (scheduler instanceof CapacityScheduler) {
    String queueName = submissionContext.getQueue();
    String appName = submissionContext.getApplicationName();
    CSQueue csqueue = ((CapacityScheduler) scheduler).getQueue(queueName);{code}
Instead of using scheduler.getQueue, we may need to consider to add a method like getAppSubmissionQueue() to get a queue based on path or name, and after that, we will put normalized queue_path back to submission context of application to make sure in the future inside scheduler we all refer to queue path.

For the comment from [~wilfreds]: 
{quote}The important part is applying a new configuration. If the configuration adds a leaf queue that is not unique the configuration update currently is rejected. With this change we would allow that config to become active. This *could* break existing applications when they try to submit to the leaf queue that is no longer unique.
{quote}
I personally think it is not a big deal if application reject reasons from RM can clearly guide users to use full qualified queue path when duplicated queue names exists. It is like if a team has only one Peter we can use the first name only otherwise we will add last name to avoid confusion. It isn't counter-intuitive to me.

Also, we need to handle queue mapping for queue-path instead of queue name also, I didn't see it from the design doc or I missed it.

Thank you [~leftnoteasy] for the comments.
{quote}And once application is submitted to CS, internal to CS, we should make sure we use queue path instead of queue name at all other places. Otherwise we will complicate other logics.
{quote}
I agree that is what I had in mind too. Make it as simple as possible inside the scheduler and that is to use just the full path internally.

For the configuration change: I do not think it is a problem and we can just accept the change. To be fair to the administrator we should show a message when the configuration is loaded or changed and the leaf queues are not unique (any more). However that is probably as far as we need to go.
{quote}Instead of using scheduler.getQueue, we may need to consider to add a method like getAppSubmissionQueue() to get a queue based on path or name, and after that, we will put normalized queue_path back to submission context of application to make sure in the future inside scheduler we all refer to queue path.
{quote}
The FS already does something like this already because it uses a placement rule in all cases. We should leverage a similar mechanism in the CS. We pass the queue from the submission into the queue placement which handles the full path or not. In both cases it just passes back the queue object which will be using the full path. If the queue is not found or the queue name is not unique it fails as per normal. The returned queue info is updated in the app and submission context.
 Far simpler than putting the burden on the core scheduler. It is all hidden in the placement of the app into the queue using the placement engine.

I did not mention queue mapping in my design. Queue mapping itself I thought did not need to change. We already calculate the parent queue in the rules if I am correct so the only change would be the return value. We do all internal handling for queues with the full queue path so it is a logical change. Using the placement rule for the qualified or not qualified mapping does require some changes in that area.

I might have forgotten to mention other bits and pieces like the cli or flow on effects on the UI but that needs to assessed when we have have a design we agree on. There will be more jiras needed to fix separate parts when the change is made to the core.

I just mentioned the mapping because based on my (admittedly limited) knowledge, it's the heart of CS when it comes to managing the queues.

It's handled inside [https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/capacity/CapacitySchedulerQueueManager.java].

So I was under the impression that this part needs to be changed, I can be wrong though.

Thank you for your feedbacks [~wilfreds], [~pbacsko], [~leftnoteasy]!

I think this can be a major issue. In a scenario when the user have let's say a job which runs daily, and it's been working like that for years, can simply break, because an other user, totally unrelated to his team or even department creates a queue with the same name. The suddenly this application will start failing, and even if we add logs which explicitly tell what is the reason behind the application rejection, user one might not even notice it started failing. (We shouldn't assume everyone has proper monitoring and warning systems). So technically any user who can create a queue, can disable an other user's application if it is started by using single queue name reference. And it concerns me a bit.

However [~adam.antal] had an idea to even fix this issue, and then we can move forwards with Wilfred's suggestion:

We should make it possible to flag QUEUES for using full queue name reference, and these flags should mean ALL queues under the flagged queue can ONLY be referenced by full queue name. For regular queues (non-flagged ones), we would still enforce the unique leaf queue policy, while newer or migrating users could stick to the full queue reference. This proposal can also helps gradual migration, for older CS users buy slowly flagging queues in which the applications are already started by queue name.

What do you think of this idea?

 

Thanks [~shuzirra], I think adding a flag (suggestion from [~adam.antal]) will prevent admin to change it accidentally, but it is hard to be understand (thinking about a regular Hadoop user). And we need to maintain it in a long run.

So instead, I would like to allow user to make changes but fail the application submission with a clear message (like you cannot submit the application because there're multiple queue with the name XYZ, you can make change to use the full qualified queue name or remove/rename duplicated queues, etc.). If admin want to regret and make changes back, they can easily do that.

Thank you for your feedbacks [~wilfreds], [~pbacsko], [~leftnoteasy] and thans [~shuzirra] for moving this forward!

Chiming in a bit late, but I would like to give my opinion as well. Apologies for being so lengthy, but I wanted to quote and reply some parts of the comments had been given so far.
 Please note that some parts of what I'm saying here is taking the FS to CS migration into account.

*1. Quoting from Wilfred's comment:*

I do agree with this, existing configurations does not break. However, allowing non-unique leaf queues can make the CS behave weirdly and inconsistently as queues are being added later on, as [~shuzirra] described this lately in his comment. More on this matter later.

About what you said: "This could break existing applications when they try to submit to the leaf queue that is no longer unique."
 Again, this is really problematic and error-prone, as detailed by [~shuzirra] in his comment above. 
 We discussed this together with Gergo and I'm trying to give more weight on how tricky this case can get and what I'm doing now is just reiterate on Gergo's comment

Imagine the following queue setup:
{code:java}
root
  |____a
  |
  |____b
  |    |____b
  |    |____c
  |    |____d
  |
  |____c
       |____e
       |____f
{code}
If someone is adding root.c.b, queue 'b' is non-unique anymore without even knowing or taking care of root.b.b is the other queue 'b'.
 Even if we log and warn in the response of the update, adding the root.c.b queue can break the app submitted to queue root.b.b.
 I can imagine many real-world scenarios where users were submitting apps to a queue (root.b.b) with just the leaf queue name ('b') and their app submission would get suddenly rejected since another queue do exist with the same name. Just consider a user-group mapping and two same usernames exist under different organizations/user groups and we can be in the situation what I depicted. I also agree to Gergo that we can't expect or assume every user and apps submission is guarded by monitoring or warning systems. 
 I think it's definitely not a good idea to break existing users and app submissions with this change.

*2. Quoting from Wangda's comment:*
{quote}I personally think it is not a big deal if application reject reasons from RM can clearly guide users to use full qualified queue path when duplicated queue names exists. It is like if a team has only one Peter we can use the first name only otherwise we will add last name to avoid confusion. It isn't counter-intuitive to me.
{quote}
How can we know it's not a big deal? As we are not fully familiar how users are submitting apps: They can have scripts (or even many scripts), cron jobs, other unknown setup and whatnot that triggers app submissions. We can't and shouldn't do any non-backward compatible changes. For me, this approach is not an acceptable one as described with my ASCII art + description in detail.

*3. Quoting from Gergo's comment*

A.

{quote}
*Some things I have in mind, so listing the ADVANTAGES and some properties of this approach:*

1. First and foremost, duplicate queue names cannot be added under unflagged queues.
 2. Using the department / user analogy here. We don't have the problem anymore that some other department adds a user and this user becomes non-unique as other department has the same username in it, so app submissions can work well for all departments / users.
 As the new department added a user (root.c.b) has their subqueues flagged, app submissions should only work with full queue paths here and at the same time, the another department had the same user (root.b.b), app submission will still work well as all queues under root.c should be referenced only referenced by full queue path.
 3. Customers can gradually move queues to use full queue path, as much as they want.
 4. FS to CS migration tool should add the flag to the root queue if moved from FS.

4. Quoting from Wangda's comment:
{quote}Thanks Gergely Pollak, I think adding a flag (suggestion from Adam Antal) will prevent admin to change it accidentally, but it is hard to be understand (thinking about a regular Hadoop user). And we need to maintain it in a long run.
{quote}
I'm not sure why this is harder to understand than regular queue and scheduler config parameters, which can be overly complex to setup.
 With this approach, at least we would give something in our user's hands: They can use the flag to move queues under to the new way to address queues (queue path) gradually. Without the flag-based approach, we don't give users anything but we require them to change their submission code everytime a leaf queue is added that is already in the hierarchy with the same name. If we don't consider this as a hard requirement, apps would fail randomly, from the perspective of the users.

*As a summary:*
 *Please note that I did not dive into the CS code to decide what is the development cost of such a flag-based solution, this is up to* [~shuzirra] *to give some estimates as the jira is on his name.*
 *However, I wanted to state and share my thoughts: Rejecting apps on submission time that worked before and won't work afterwards seems like very far from an acceptable solution.*

[~snemeth], most of the explanation looks reasonable to me. Regarding how to prevent breaking existing CS queue contract. Instead of adding a flag to each queue, I suggest to have a global config in CS about allow duplicated leaf queue name or not.

Why I'm opposed to add the flag to each queue?

To me, use a queue name, or queue path is an intuitive choice of a user (not admin). If the queue name had duplicates, it should fail and give you the right reason.

If everybody think we should not implicitly change the CS behavior to allow duplicate-named leaf queues, a top-level CS config should be sufficient (like ..<cs-prefix>.duplicated-queue-names.allowed), and clearly document it may cause existing app failures. This won't add any burden for user to understand, and it is also relatively easy for admin to understand. Anything config added to the queue hierarchy seems a bit tricky. (Like admin has to think about how is the queue override looks like, etc.). And for the auto-created queue case it is not obvious to add such configs, etc.My big lesson learned is we should add as less knobs as we could, too many knobs will increase our support areas a lot and make code hard to be maintained.

A per queue flag looks very strange. I am also not sure it will help or add anything on top of having a global flag that just prevents the config change. Summarising the proposed solution: add a flag that prevents the admin from adding non unique leaf queue names and thus fail the config change when he/she tries

The behaviour inside the scheduler must all be based on the full queue paths anyway. You cannot have one queue being addressed by the leaf name and the other by the path. The code complexity to do that would be enormous and lead to unsupportable code. That means that after the placement rule(s) are run and the app is placed everything must be based on a full path.

Placement rules throw up a totally different issue here. When we use placement rules we have one of two possible cases:
 * the rule generates a queue name and a parent queue name, i.e. a path
 * the rule generates just a leaf queue name

Which means that the rule can generate a leaf queue anywhere in the hierarchy without specifying a hierarchy. So no parent is set by the rule but the leaf queue generated could be located below a parent. With that last possibility we have the extra complexity in that the rules are not behaving consistently.
 Example:
Two CS definitions to compare both allow queue creation and overwrite of the submitted queue:
 # queues: root.parent.wilfred
 # queues: root

mapping rule defined: {{u:%user:%user}}

1) user submitting the app is {{wilfred}} queue given on submission is default
In CS config 1 we submit to the {{root.parent.wilfred}} queue while in the second CS config we submit to {{root.wilfred}} queue.

2) user submitting the app is {{peter}} queue given on submission is default
In both CS configs we submit to the {{root.peter}} queue.

With different config at the CS level but for the same rule we place the app in a sub queue sometimes but not the other, that is inconsistent.

I think rules even need to start taking this flag into account to preserve this inconsistent behaviour.

[~wilfreds], I agree with,
{quote}The behaviour inside the scheduler must all be based on the full queue paths anyway.
{quote}
I also agree that we need to carefully think about queue mapping and queue path. I would suggest moving queue mapping related changes to a different Jira to avoid putting two big patches together. (If it already considered both scenario we can keep it here).

Uploaded the firs POC patch. This version CAN run jobs by their short AND their full name, currently the leaf uniqueness constraint is in place, but the data store it prepared for leaf collisions. Currently working on testing and if nothing seems to be broken, I can remove the uniqueness constraint from leaf queues. Also I can add the feature control flag, as discussed earlier.

The biggest risk I see is the modification in AbstractCSQueue where I've changed the getQueueName to return the full name of the queue. Based on my analysis this method is mostly called to get the queue's string identifier, and as it was mentioned earlier we should use full queue names for queue identification. So I need to carefully check every call of this method if it breaks anything. But a quick smoke test was successful, I was able to start a job using only the leaf queue name as well as using the full queue name.

[~shuzirra], I think we should not change semantics of GetQueueName of AbstractCSQueue to avoid the change of API. (We should keep REST API related to queues unchanged otherwise it will be an incompatible change).

Instead of changing GetQueueName, you should check all callers of the GetQueueName first. And there's already a GetQueuePath, you can leverage that.

I briefly checked GetQueueName usages, there're 155 of them in production code. Most of them are just for logging purposes ("org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.activities.*" should be considered as logging also). It may take a few hours to identify and change everything, but manually change GetQueueName to GetQueuePath case-by-case sounds like a safer option to me.

I agree, {{getQueueName()}} should stay as is. We have a {{getQueuePath()}} already. Every CSQueue can already return both. We should change all non external facing calls getting the name of a queue to the path version. The only calls that can stay are the ones that provide their data in an externally viewable form (REST, UI or IPC) as to not break compatibility.

I also do not see why we would need the ambiguous queue list. The queue is always unique when a path is used. It does not matter if the current leaf queue name uniqueness is enforced or not.
 Everything can always be found by its path. If I do not have a path I expect leaf queue uniqueness and can find the queue by just checking the part after the last _dot_ in the path.
 i.e.
 * queue paths defined as: root.parent.child1
 child queue unique flag is set
 find a queue with name: *child1* (no dots, expect leaf queue uniqueness) -> returns the queue correctly
 * add a queue defined as: root.otherparent.child1
 child queue unique flag is not set, allowed
 find a queue with name: *child1* (no dots, expect leaf queue uniqueness) -> returns an error

Internally we just store everything using the path, that would remove the whole keeping things in sync and makes the code consistent when combined with using the path everywhere internally

Thank you for your feedback [~leftnoteasy] and [~wilfreds]. Originally I tried to keep the getQueueName's behavior, but as I started to investigate it's behavior I've realized we MUST change the way it works.

First let's start with a simple question: What is the purpose of the queue's name? Why does it have one, what do we want to use it for? (Ok these are actually 3 questions)

As I see in the code the queue name's main purpose is to IDENTIFY a queue, and not just some nice display string. This means the name MUST identify uniquely the queue. Queues are looked up by their name, hence it must be unique or all those references can break. So this is the reason I changed it's behavior to return a unique identifier (the queue's path). Obviously I must check if it breaks anything, and fix it, but allowing multiple leaf queues with the same name is inherently a breaking change. I just try to minimize the impact to change the reference internally to full name everywhere (as you both suggested earlier).

About the API breaking. If we have an API which provides us with a queue name, and currently it is a short name, then anyone who uses it to reference to the queue by the provided name will fail in the case of name duplicates. If we return the full name of the queue, then it will still work for them, unless they build on the fact it is just a short name. As long as the queue name is used for queue identification, and not for string operations, it shouldn't cause any problem. Other cases must be identified.

This is why I ended up with this approach. This way we change the queue naming once and for all to use full names, and we adjust services which would fail on this change. But we cannot keep the short queue name as reference and have multiple queues with the same name, it's just impossible. This patch will already introduce some changes which can cause issues in already working systems and it might be better to do all invasive changes at once.

I can use the getQueuePath (almost) everywhere where we currently using getQueueName, but the result would be the same, with some severe inconsistencies: Using short names would result you being able to get the name of a queue, but you wouldn't be able to get your queue by that very same name from the queue manager. This is just confusing, inconsistent, and not maintenable in my opinion. The quemanager.get(queue.getQueueName()) call can result in NULL or error! (when the queue name is not unique) This is not good practice in my opinion. 

We need the ambiguous queue list, because we provide a remove method, which can result in a previously ambiguous name becoming ambiguous, and it's much faster to get it from a hashmap O(1), and then check the size of the Set O(1), instead of looking through all queues to see if the collision have been resolved O( n ).

The short name map has been introduced for the very same reason, when we look up a queue, we just look it up in 2 HashMaps 2 x O(1), instead of iterating through all queue names and splicing the last part for short name O( n ).

So all in all, I've sacrificed some memory space for a drastic speed increase. O( n ) vs O(1) might not seem a huge improvement in the case of a few queues, but considering the queue parse method will make a get call for each queue to check if it is already present in the store, we have a complexity of O(n*n), which IS something to think about.

Please help me to think this through one more time with taking my reasons into consideration, thank you.

Thanks [~shuzirra], [~wilfreds] for sharing your thoughts!

1) Regarding change semantics of GetQueueName() to return full qualified queue name v.s. use GetQueuePath:

If we decide to go the first route, we need to remove usages of AbstractCSQueue.GetQueuePath (which has 128 usages), and add a GetShortQueueName in some places. So to me, there are no significant differences to just change internal CS usages to use GetQueuePath().

2) No matter which way we decided to go, I think we should make sure that:

API compatibility, this is critical since I assume there're lots of monitoring framework, JMX metrics, etc. based on this. If we upgrade an existing CS-based cluster, they should expect the same result. Please refer to API compatibility: [https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Compatibility.html]

Internal usage of GetQueuePath (or GetShortQueueName if we choose proposed approach). And externally, we should make sure we can get a queue by short name, or long name. I want to make sure we only check short name / long name in external call (like submit app to specified queue), and in all other places, we use the full queue path to operate. I think introducing a new CSQueueStore sounds good, but I recommend to add a separate method to CSQueueStore to check both short/long names and make it used by external callers only (And in contrast, internal CS method should check only one HashMap instead of two). We can review details of CSQueueStore separately.

Hey folks, I can see that a lengthy conversation is already going on, but I'll try to keep my one short.

Regarding {{getQueueName()}} / {{getQueuePath()}}, it's up to you to decide, I don't have enough context right now.
I'm trying to be constructive from code readability standpoint.

Three things that stand out to me are the following:

#1
{{private final Map<String, Set<String>> ambiguousShortNames = new HashMap<>();}}

My question to [~shuzirra] is: do we need to keep track of what queues a short name is mapped to? Do we use this information anywhere? Because if we use it as a counter, then it's simply much easier to have a
{{private final Map<String, Integer> leafCount = new HashMap<>();}}

And quite obviously you don't have ambiguity if leafCount == 1.

Because of this, the {{addShortNameMapping()}} is already a bit hard to grasp.

#2 I would synchronize the public method {{add()}}, not the private method.

To show what I was thinking of, here's how I'd code add/remove:

{noformat}
    // Keep as it as
    public synchronized void add(CSQueue queue) {
        String fullName = queue.getQueueName();
        String shortName = queue.getQueueShortName();

        fullNameQueues.put(fullName, queue);
        if (queue instanceof LeafQueue) {
            addShortNameMapping(shortName, fullName);
        }
    }


    private void addShortNameMapping(String shortName, String fullName) {
        // initialize if necessary
        leafCount.computeIfAbsent(shortName, v -> 0);

        if (leafCount.computeIfPresent(shortName, (k,v) -> v + 1) > 1) {
            LOG.warn("Multiple mapping for queue {}!", shortName);
        } else {
            shortNameToFullName.put(shortName, fullName);
        }
    }

    public synchronized void remove(CSQueue queue) {
        //if no queue is specified, we can consider it already removed, also consistent
        //with hashmap behaviour, so no new issues will be caused by it
        if (queue == null) {
            return;
        }

        String fullName = queue.getQueueName();
        String shortName = queue.getQueueShortName();

        //removing from the full and short name maps as well
        fullNameQueues.remove(fullName);

        if (queue instanceof LeafQueue &&
                leafCount.computeIfPresent(shortName, (k,v) -> v - 1) == 0) {
            shortNameToFullName.remove(shortName);
        }
    }
{noformat}

#3 In {{get()}} is important to check ambiguous mappings, so an exception must be thrown if leafCount > 1.

As per our discussion with [~wilfreds], [~snemeth], [~sunilg], we will be making the behaviour of the getQueuename configurable(by default the getQueueName will return only the leaf name, but it can be changed to return the full path), and will do the name changes as follows:

 - External facing APIs will always use the getQueueName

 - Internally we will use the full name to store / reference the queues, and we will update the getQueueName method to getQueuePath, to make sure we are working with fully qualified name

This way we minimize the impact for user, but both CS and migrating FS users can use their external monitoring tools as they used to.

Uploading next POC, changing to patch available to run tests, there is still a long way to go, in this patch I've replaced the tirival getQueueName->getQueuePath replacements, and collected all the places I still need to check for deeper analysis.

The latest build picked up {{CSQueue.getQueueUsage.txt}}. [~shuzirra] you might want to re-upload the patch again.

In this latest patch I've checked all CSQueue.getQueueName calls, and replaced them with getQueuePath, also checked how those values were used, and changed the code if it was necessary. The biggest change was around the placement rules, but I think I've managed to solve the issues with minimal impact and code changes.

The problem with placement rules is they can dynamically create colliding queue names, and at configuration time it is impossible to determine whether the rule will collide with an already existing queue or not. So in this implementation, I changed the config parsing methods to be aware of the the possible name collisions and also added an extra ambiguity check just before creating the placement context, this way the user will be able to see in the logs why the application fails.

The expected behaviour for name collisions is to refuse the application submission if the matching placement rule results in an ambiguous queue name. This is consistent with the app submission behaviour when providing a queue name, but it is a leaf name only.

Next step is to check the application submission side, and make sure the submitted queue names are parsed properly and are compatible with the internal full queue name usage. 

Also marked a few parts of the code for cleanup later, we are using 3 classes with very similar behaviour and it was really confusing to understand the difference between them (practically there is none), but since this patch is already growing in size, and I haven't even touched the tests, I'll file separate Jiras about those later.

Did some very basic smoke testing, and in this version it is possible to submit applications with leaf queue names and full path as well. However it need some excessive testing, for ACLs, placement rules, preemtion just to name a few. But since the initial manual tests worked I've updated the testcases to use getQueuePath instead of getQueueName, probably a lot will fail this way too, but then I'm moving on to fixing those. After the tests are fixed, I start manually testing the more complex features of the CS.

Latest 2 patches are fixes to get rid of the enormous amount of unit test failures. Some cleanup for the CSQueueStore are required, since I had to reintroduce a feature which caused a bug in the current queue management solution, since too many tests were relying on it. 

The tests often times get non leaf queues by their short name, the issue with this is it is possible to overwrite a leaf queue with a non-leaf queue. Eg if we have the two following queues:

root.a.leaf

root.b.c.leaf.e

Then the get('leaf') will return the root.b.c.leaf instead of root.a.leaf. Also in the current implementation it is quite hectic what happens if there is a non-leaf queue with the same name as a leaf queue. So I thought I would only allow referencing by short names only to leaf queues, but it won't work.

So here is my proposal:

Leaf queues will have priority, so if there is leaf queue and a non-leaf queue with the short name, the name will always refer to the leaf queue, if there are two leaf queues with the same name, none will be accessible. This is not the best solution but it will fix the bug in the current implementation, and we keep the possibility to reference non-leaf queues by their short name, and our tests will be grateful for this.

Latest patch (no. 9) is  still about test failure fixes, if I there won't be many test failures, then I'll get to the code cleanup of the new classes, also adding own testcases for new code. And when all tests pass, I'll remove the constraint which prevents multiple leafqueues to be created with the same name. It shouldn't break too many tests but I think its better to cleanup the current test failures first, to see the change's impact.

Hi [~shuzirra] ,
 Phew... This was pretty hard to review, spent at least 2 hours with it.
 Thanks for working on this patch, good job, this change is incredible. :)

*In general, +1 for your approach by introducing CSQueueStore.*

*MY MAIN COMMENTS:*
 1. I can see many TODOs in the patch. Do you want to address them in the next patch?
 Make sure you remove all the TODOs you have added to the code as they could not be part of the commit.


 2. Make sure to adhere to the 80 chars line limit: I saw some very long comments.


 3. I think I spot something suspicious with CapacitySchedulerPreemptionContext: 
 The reader methods (getQueuePartition, getQueuePartitions) are using the full queue path, like you are using it in 
 FifoIntraQueuePreemptionPlugin#skipContainerBasedOnIntraQueuePolicy
 However, the implementation of this interface is passing a simple queue name in ProportionalCapacityPreemptionPolicy#addPartitionToUnderServedQueues. Can you please double check your changes around this code?
 4. In QueuePath#QueuePath(java.lang.String): The value of leafQueue is assigne to two fields: leafQueue, fullPath. Could you please add a comment here? I don't get what's going on by just reading the code.


 5. Please add javadoc to methods: CapacityScheduler#normalizeQueueName and CapacityScheduler#isAmbiguous


 6. TestCSQueueStore: I guess you will add something more in here :)

 

*COMMENTS FOR CSQueueStore:*
 1. Can you please add a javadoc to the class CSQueueStore, to its fields and to its main methods (at least the publicly accessible ones + addShortNameMapping)?


 2. Method getFullNameQueues can be package-private.
 3. Method getShortNameQueues can be package-private.


 4. There's an unnecessary comment in this class:
{code:java}
//    shortNameToFullName.entrySet().stream().forEach(e -> System.out.println("<>" + e));
//    return null;
{code}
 

5. Comment could be a javadoc instead:
{code:java}
  //we must synchronize here because we need to maintain multiple maps to be
  //in sync, and concurrent hashMap does not help with that
{code}
 

6. Unnecessary commented code in method add

 

7. In method remove, you have an unnecessary containsKey check, intellij reports this as well:
{code:java}
if (shortNameToFullName.containsKey(shortName)) {
  shortNameToFullName.remove(shortName);
}
{code}
Remove will remove the mapping if it does exist, otherwise it won't do anything.
 I would remove the containsKey check, unless you explicitly want to highlight it.

 

8. Can you please add curly braces to the if in remove(java.lang.String)?

9. Method getQueueCount is unused

10. Method getByFullName can be package-private

11. Method getByShortName can be package-private

12. Method isAmbiguous can be package-private

13. In method getByShortName, can you add curly braces to the if?

 

*RENAMINGS:* 
 1. I found many occurrences of:
{code:java}
queueName = queue.getQueuePath
{code}
and
{code:java}
String leafQueueName = leafQueue.getQueuePath();
{code}
throughout your patch.
 Please rename ALL the variables to queuePath (or maybe fullQueueName) as it's pretty confusing like this.

 

2. Please rename the first parameter of GuaranteedOrZeroCapacityOverTimePolicy.LeafQueueState#addLeafQueueStateIfNotExists to queuePath as this method now receives a queue path instead of a name of the leaf queue.

 

3. You have a call in FifoIntraQueuePreemptionPlugin#skipContainerBasedOnIntraQueuePolicy:
{code:java}
TempQueuePerPartition tq = context.getQueueByPartition(queueName, partition);
{code}
I think it'd be a good idea to rename the parameter of CapacitySchedulerPreemptionContext#getQueueByPartition to fullQueueName or add a short javadoc to this method.

 

4. Please rename the 'queueName' parameter to 'fullQueueName' in CapacityScheduler#checkAndGetApplicationPriority

 

5. Please rename the 'leafQueueName' parameter to 'fullQueueName' in QueuePlacementRuleUtils#validateQueueMappingUnderParentQueue.

 

6. Please rename the parameter "queueName" to "fullQueueName" in methods checkAbsoluteCapacity / checkMaxCapacity CSQueueUtils#checkMaxCapacity

 

7. Please rename local variable called "leafQueueName" to "fullQueueName" in CapacityScheduler#markContainerForKillable.

 

8. Please rename local variable called "leafQueueName" to "fullQueueName" in CapacityScheduler#markContainerForNonKillable.

 

*NITS:*
 1. There's an unused import in QueuePlacementRuleUtils 
 2. I can see some whitespace only changes in CapacitySchedulerConfigValidator#validateQueueHierarchy. Please remove them from the patch if they are not necessary.
 3. CapacitySchedulerQueueManager#normalizeQueueName(String name) could be private.
 4. CapacitySchedulerQueueManager#getQueueByShortName is unused.
 5. Parameters of CapacitySchedulerConfigValidator#validateQueueHierarchy look very weird.

[~snemeth] thank you for the feedback, I'll start implementing the suggested changes as soon all tests pass.

Thanks [~shuzirra] for the monster patch! 

Took a quick look at the patch, overall looks good. (I skipped the hardest queue mapping module to leave to other folks to review). 

 1) Make sure commented code is not part of the final patch.

2) CSQueueStore:
 - Only fullNameQueues is ConcurrentHashMap, is it intentional?
 - getByShortName can be converted to private method, and the {{CapacitySchedulerQueueManager#getQueueByShortName}} is not used, can be removed.
 - Instead of Synchronized lock, I suggest to use ReadWriteLock, the method like {{get}} is not safe since it access multiple fields. There's very infrequent write to queue map comparing to read.

3) CapacityScheduler.java:
{code:java}
1144	      Queue  queue = attempt.getQueue();
1145	      CSQueue csQueue = queue instanceof CSQueue
{code}
This check is uncessceary. When CS is enabled, all queues in the RM is CSQueue.

4) CapacitySchedulerConfigValidator.java: 
 validateQueueHierarchy: Have mixed usage of queueName and queuePath, suggest to move to queuePath for less ambiguous.

5) There're 18 TODOs in the patch, I suggest to mark "must-to-fix" TODOs to FIXME, in most cases TODO means we will never do it. :). In Hadoop there're 731 TODOs.

Thanks [~shuzirra] for the patch. Have tested below scenarios with the patch and it works fine except two issues.
 
 1. Job Submission with leaf queuename and full queue path.
 2. Queue Placement
 3. Auto Creation of Leaf Queue.
 4. RM UI
 5. RMWebService Scheduler response.
 6. RMAdminService RefreshQueues
 7. Scheduler Configuration Mutation API - add / remove / update queue.
 8. Recovery
 9. RM JMX Metrics - YARN-9772

*Issue 1: RM fails to start when a dynamic parent queue "batch" (auto-create-child-queue.enabled=true) and another leaf queue "batch" exists.* 

CS Config:

root.batch -> (auto-create-child-queue.enabled=true)
 root.default
 root.A.batch

yarn.scheduler.capacity.queue-mappings = u:%user:batch.%user*

*Issue 2:*

*RM Starts fine with below queue config but when submitting job with queuename "A" it fails. The job submission works fine when specifying the full queue name root.B.A. There is only one leaf queue with queuename "A" and the placement has to find that right?*

[~prabhujoseph] could you try it with this mapping rule? 

{{u:%user:root.batch.%user}}

That is, you give the full path, not just the leaf queue name. Although I believe {{QueueManager.get()}} should be able to retrieve both.

[~pbacsko] Have tested with full queue name in mapping and which failed with different error.

{code}
<property><name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.queue-mappings</name>
<value>u:%user:root.batch.%user</value></property>

	at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.capacity.CapacityScheduler.initializeQueues(CapacityScheduler.java:750)
{code}

The existing way it worked is by just setting parent queue name like below.

<property><name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.queue-mappings</name>
<value>u:%user:batch.%user</value></property>

*Reference:* https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.2.0/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/CapacityScheduler.html

{code}
user-group queue mapping(s) listed in yarn.scheduler.capacity.queue-mappings need to specify an additional parent queue parameter to identify which parent queue the auto-created leaf queues need to be created under. Refer above Queue Mapping based on User or Group section for more details. Please note that such parent queues also need to enable auto-creation of child queues as mentioned in Parent queue configuration for dynamic leaf queue creation and management section below

Example:

 <property>
   <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.queue-mappings</name>
   <value>u:user1:queue1,g:group1:queue2,u:user2:%primary_group,u:%user:parent1.%user</value>
   <description>
     Here, u:%user:parent1.%user mapping allows any <user> other than user1,
     user2 to be mapped to its own user specific leaf queue which
     will be auto-created under <parent1>.
   </description>
 </property>
 
{code}


[~prabhujoseph] thanks, I think it's likely that this piece of code is missing that I mentioned here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-10108?focusedCommentId=17025143&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17025143

[~wangda], [~prabhujoseph] and [~pbacsko] thank you for your feedback. Latest patch contains a lot of fixes from Szilard's review, and some serious changes to CSQueueStore to fix the queue overwrite problem. Also added some tests for the aforementioned class. I removed the condition which prevented creating multiple leaf queues with the same name, so I expect some regression, due to the changes, but I don't expect anything serious. I'll get to implementing changes suggested in the rest of the reviews, and checking the issues reported by Prabhu. Hopefully next iteration of the patch will be something very close to committable material.

Thanks [~shuzirra]. Appreciate the same.

Thanks [~shuzirra] for uploading another monster patch! 

I didn't check other places, I only checked the CSQueueStore related items: 

*Nits: *

- CapacitySchedulerQueueManager#getShortNameQueues please mark @VisibleByTests
- Similarily, mark CSQueueStore#getShortNameQueues @VisibleByTests

*Primary: Locking of the class still have many issues: *

For all methods will be accessed by external class. Make sure that: 

1) Avoid using synchronized lock when read/write lock present.
2) ALL external read-only methods protected by readlock. 
3) ALL external writable methods protected by writelock.
4) Use
{code} 
try {
	lock.(read/or write).lock()

	.. your logic ..
} catch (exception) {
	// if there's any
} finally {
	lock.(read/or write).unlock()
}
{code}
To make sure lock is always released: Example: CapacityScheduler#serviceStop

5) After the above changes, you can remove all usage of {{ConcurrentHashMap}}, it is bad for performance with locks. Hashmap will be way faster under the protection of lock.


[~shuzirra] while uploading next patch, please remove POC string from patch name.

[~wangda] Thank you for the feedback, my original thought process was I will keep the getMap and fullQueue list as a concurent hash map, since those are the most frequently read maps, and probably ConcurentHashMap can handle the locking internally more efficiently than me externally. The other internal maps were protected by the locks you suggested. About synchronized, to be honest I simply missed removing those, I did not plan to use both, thank you for bringing it to my attention.

However the try / catch wrapping for locks was a huge deal, thanks for pointing it out.

Since the current partial locking solution was confusing, I've just simply removed the ConcurentHasmaps, and added locking to all externally accessible methods, which access any of the internal data structures, just as you've suggested.

[~prabhujoseph] I've managed to test the issues you've brought to my attention, and thank you for that again. Issue

1) Batch is ambiguous, so the rule will fail, if you use root.batch, as [~pbacsko] suggested, it will work from now on, it had not before this fix, thanks for finding the issue.

2) It is a bit more tricky, I had a discussion with [~wangda] and [~wilfreds] and the conclusion was, if there are any queue name collisions (even between parent and leaf), we simply mark those ambiguous, and we won't allow access any of those queues by their short name. With the exception of root, root is always accessible, and always means root, root is protected, root is king. This goes against what I've said in one of my previous comments, but currently if we have these queues:

root.a.b

root.b.a

Neither a or b can be accessed by their name. It is possible to give leaf queue a priority, however in that case the ambiguity check becomes a bit harder, and the CSQueue store will become a lot more complex. But I can do it, however we need a consensus about it.

 

Also fixed a bunch of checkstyle issues, if there is no regression due to the changes I've made to fix Prabhu's findings, I only have to remove the TODOs and create Jiras about them, and then we are getting ready.

Thanks [~shuzirra] for the update. 

I only checked the updates of CSQueueStore, now the class looks good to me.  I will let others to check the rest of the patch. :) 

In the latest patch, there are mostly cosmetic changes. I've removed most of the TODOs as [~wangda] and [~snemeth] suggested, will create follow up Jira based on those. Fixed additional checkstyle issues, and added a proper error message when a queue is ambiguously referenced during submission, so the user will now get feedback, that the queue exists, but actually multiple queues exist with the same name.

Also dropped the POC prefix, since it's getting near completion, so the latest patch is 

YARN-9879.014.patch

[~shuzirra] cud pls check latest errors.

[~sunilg] The latest errors are flaky tests, we keep retriggering the jenkins job to get a green, but if you check the last 2 runs, completely different tests fail, for the same patch set.  Also last patch only contains cosmetic and log message changes, so it shouldn't cause any issue, but trying to get a jenkins +1

Somehow jenkins results are not showing here.

Somehow https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-10198 was committed, so I had to rebase and resolve, uploading new patch for testing.

Reuploading PATCH 15 to retrigger Jenkins job, because build issue have been fixed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-16818.

[~shuzirra] test case failures seems not related, could you please confirm the same?

[~sunilg] yes, that is correct, it is unrelated, and SLS tests are failing quite often with no real reason. But to be sure I've executed the test case a few times manually, and it was passing properly, so this one seems to be a flaky one.

Thanks [~shuzirra] 

Lets get this in now. +1 to the latest patch.

Thanks [~shuzirra] for your contributions. Appreciate the same.

Thanks [~wangda] [~snemeth] [~pbacsko] [~prabhujoseph] for your valuable comments

Hi [~shuzirra] and [~sunilg]. Probably this broke MAPREDUCE-7269. Would you check the PR?

Now I'm thinking we need to mark this issue as "incompatible change" because this issue changed the output of o.a.h.mapred.JobClient#getQueueAclsForCurrentUser, which is {{@Public}} and {{@Stable}}. What do you think?

Hi [~shuzirra] ,

really appreciate this patch, we are using this patch in our branch, it worked quite well, but still we found there are lots of place still using "getQueueName" , and we also see "fullPathQueueNamingPolicy" could change the output of getQueueName to queuePath directly, but the code is set it to final false. Is that for future work ? or something still block the directly replacement between queueName and queuePath, so currently we set it false, should we consider to  change it into conf ?

 

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

private final boolean fullPathQueueNamingPolicy = false;

@Override
public String getQueueName() {
 if (fullPathQueueNamingPolicy) {
 return queuePath;
 }
 return queueName;
}
