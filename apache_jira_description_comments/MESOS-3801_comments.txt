[~neilc] Can you add the verbose logs too ?

Successful test run that takes 15 seconds.

Verbose log for test failure.

Done!

Hi, [~neilc] I set up a ubuntu wily virtual machine by vagrant today. And could not reproduce your problem in current master according your steps. Does this still could reproduce in your env? By the way, provide a error log which enable {{GLOG_v=1}} may more helpful.
