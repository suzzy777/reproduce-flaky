    looks good except for a few comments.
    is it possible to add tests for these changes?


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    cancel is only available in livy 0.3 which is not released yet, so no test for it. I can add that after livy 0.3 is released.

    I trigger the CI, but the last CI failure is not relevant. Because this PR only modify livy interpreter, other failure should be flaky test. Unfortunately we seems to have more and more flaky test :(

    Sure CI failure looks it is not relevant to this. LGTM!

    That's flaky test, I several times of `WelcomePageSuite` in CI failure.
