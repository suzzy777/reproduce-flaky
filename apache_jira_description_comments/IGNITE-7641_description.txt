Ignite provides a way to specify an expiry policy on per entry level, but there is no way to know the current TTL for a particular key.

We can add {{CacheEntry#ttl()}} and/or {{IgniteCache#ttl(K key)}} method that will provide this information. Looks like it's already available via {{GridCacheMapEntry#ttl()}}, so we just need to properly expose it to public API.

Here is the user forum discussion about this: http://apache-ignite-users.70518.x6.nabble.com/Get-TTL-of-the-specific-K-V-entry-td19817.html
