Toree's build is quite complex and has flaky tests. The complexity is partly inherent to the nature of the project, however it is also due to accumulated features over time that are no longer used.

In an attempt to improve developer productivity, I propose a 3-part plan to increase build stability and speed:

1. Revamp the sbt build by consolidating dependencies and refactoring the configuration to the current best practices (specifically moving common behaviour out of project/common.scala and into build-wide settings and auto-plugins)

2. Fix the flaky tests that currenlty fail due to classloader issues.

3. Refactor the travis build configuration to be runnable as a container (this should greatly improve CI throughput and latency).
