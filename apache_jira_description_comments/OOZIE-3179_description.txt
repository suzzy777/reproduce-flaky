Recently a customer requested a way to include several job.properties variables to every workflow in their cluster.

Normally the config-default.xml file would be the best way to include a set of variables, but it does not scale very well if that file needs to be updated, as it would require it to be updated in every workflow application path.

What I am requesting is another job.properties variable that can point to a config-default.xml file, or a comma separated list of config-default.xml files that will all be applied to the workflow.
