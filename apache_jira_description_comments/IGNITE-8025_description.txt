GridTestUtils.runMultiThreadedAsync returns a future with cancel() support, but cancellation implementation never interrupts threads that execute user-provided tasks. That is, those threads can continue their execution even after test method finishes.

The reproducer attached demonstrates activity from threads created by test0 after test0 finished and test1 is being run.
