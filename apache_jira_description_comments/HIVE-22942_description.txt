I never opened a jira about this...but it might actually help collect ideas and actually start going somewhere sooner than later :D

Right now we maintain the ptest2 project inside Hive to be able to run Hive tests in a distributed fashion...the backstab of this solution is that we are putting much effort into maintaining a distributed test execution framework...

I think it would be better if we could find an off the shelf solution for the task and migrate to that instead of putting more efforts into the ptest framework


some info/etc about how it compares to existing one:
