Currently when you re-run a workflow with property "oozie.wf.rerun.failnodes"Â  set to true,

you can no longer re-run it again with "oozie.wf.rerun.skip.nodes" property specified, even if you set "oozie.wf.rerun.failnodes" to false.

This kind of limitation is not reasonable. There is only one case where "oozie.wf.rerun.failnodes" is true and "oozie.wf.rerun.skip.nodes" is not null or empty, that should be disallowed.
