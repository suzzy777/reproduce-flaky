If there is an error when trying to contact the dataflow service in Python's Dataflow.poll_for_job_completion, we may exit the thread prematurely.Â 

A typical manifestation is: Dataflow Runner fails with:

{noformat}
AssertionError: Job did not reach to a terminal state after waiting indefinitely.
{noformat}

however job execution continues, and succeeds.
