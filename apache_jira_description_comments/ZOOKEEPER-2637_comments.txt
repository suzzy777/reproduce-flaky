Netty tests are known flaky. Linking with ZOOKEEPER-2135 umbrella JIRA for tracking purposes.

[~amita-persistent] thanks for reporting this. we typically upload logs so that we can determine the cause of the failure. also, would be interested in investigating this issue? I'd be happy to assign it to you.

I am trying run the unit test in my ubuntu box couple times. I am unable to reproduce the failure. Looks like the issue happened on RHEL base machine. I will see if I am able reproduce it there

I got an RHEL 5 machine on AWS and attempted to build it there too. I did not see the test failing there too. [~amita-persistent] : Will you be upload the logs and long with exact steps that you did to see this issue?
