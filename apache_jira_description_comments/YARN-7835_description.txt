It is observed race condition that if master container is killed for some reason and launched on same node then NMTimelinePublisher doesn't add timelineClient. But once completed container for 1st attempt has come then NMTimelinePublisher removes the timelineClient. 
 It causes all subsequent event publishing from different client fails to publish with exception Application is not found. !
