{quote}
$mvn clean package -Pcompile-protobuf  -X
....
\[DEBUG\] RegionServerStatus.proto:81:9: "RegionTransition" is already defined in file "ZooKeeper.proto".
\[DEBUG\] RegionServerStatus.proto:114:12: "RegionTransition" seems to be defined in "ZooKeeper.proto", which is not imported by "RegionServerStatus.proto".  To use it here, please add the necessary import.
\[ERROR\] protoc compiler error

Through It will be ok if we compile the the ZooKeeper.proto and RegionServerStatus.proto seperately. it is not very convenient.

The new RegionTransition is RegionServerStatus.proto and introduced in HBASE-11059.
