    the same test profile failed in the last 2 CI runs, is that something to be concerned about?

    I think these are flaky test. Because all the failed test are not pig related. Changes in this PR is only on pig interpreter.
    
    ```
    Failed tests: 
      NotebookTest.testAbortParagraphStatusOnInterpreterRestart:760 expected:<ABORT> but was:<RUNNING>
     
    Tests run: 148, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
    ```
    
    ```
    Results :
     
    Tests in error: 
      ZeppelinIT.testAngularRunParagraph:315->AbstractZeppelinIT.waitForText:84 Â» StaleElementReference
     
    ```
