Sorry about the build failures. https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/14117/ should ignore the test for now. I will work on porting MAPREDUCE-6441 separately to the minicluster so that we can re-enable the test again.

IMPALA-8880: Disable EventsProcessorStressTest

EventsProcessorStressTest is flaky. The root-cause of this is MAPREDUCE-6441 which is
unavailable in the component builds we use in the minicluster. The test will be renabled
once we port MAPREDUCE-6441 to Hive-3 and Hive-2 minicluster

Testing:
1. Ran the test on hive-2 and confirmed its being ignored
