Seems like the test should expect the 2nd offer. [~nnielsen] can you take a look?

Will do - sorry for the tardy reply

Right - I see the problem. The launch task request fails and the resources are reoffered and it worked before because we raced out of the test.
We can either discard any subsequent offers or wait for the recovered resources. Both work, but the first is faster.

I will get a patch ready.

    Fixed flaky MasterTest.LaunchDuplicateOfferTest.

    A couple of races could occur in the "launch tasks on multiple offers"
    tests where recovered resources from purposely-failed invocations turned
    into a subsequent resource offer and oversaturated the expect's.
