Only failing on 3.0

This doesn't fail in an instance of the jenkins testing docker image, either in isolation, or the offline tools suite.  This is as close as possible to a jenkins instance and still won't reproduce, so this is going to be interesting.

Apparently 3.0 is just on the cusp of sometimes creating 4 sstables, which causes autocompaction to kick in, resulting in a single sstable.  I have a [branch that disables autocompaction|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/tree/CASSANDRA-17327], and to finally be done with this test here are repeated runs passing for everything: [3.0|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/367/workflows/c9107c4c-e921-4a25-a0f1-a470bccc4434/jobs/4172], [3.11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/369/workflows/28af769d-05fb-4dae-81c2-084353dd0e2f/jobs/4192], [4.0|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/366/workflows/2a0547f6-f5b7-4261-ab32-5f95ccf57390/jobs/4151], and [trunk|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/368/workflows/e114c12f-8b94-4e54-bdcb-944c4f3c00cb/jobs/4178].

That totals 400 runs across all branches. +1

Committed, thanks.
