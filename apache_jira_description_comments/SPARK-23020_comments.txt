I think I found the race in the code, now need to figure out how to fix it... :-/

I had to revert this patch as it broke [{{YarnClusterSuite.timeout to get SparkContext in cluster mode triggers failure}}| https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-branch-2.3-test-maven-hadoop-2.7/94/testReport/org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn/YarnClusterSuite/timeout_to_get_SparkContext_in_cluster_mode_triggers_failure/history/]

Bummer. I'll try to take another look later today.

FYI The {{SparkLauncherSuite}} test is still failing occasionally (a lot less common though): https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-branch-2.3-test-maven-hadoop-2.6/142/testReport/org.apache.spark.launcher/SparkLauncherSuite/testInProcessLauncher/history/

Argh. Feel free to disable it in branch-2.3; please leave it on on master so we can get more info while I look at it.

I'm sorry but the flakiness in the test still refuses to go away: [https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-branch-2.3-test-maven-hadoop-2.7/154/testReport/org.apache.spark.launcher/SparkLauncherSuite/testInProcessLauncher/history/.|https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-branch-2.3-test-maven-hadoop-2.7/154/testReport/org.apache.spark.launcher/SparkLauncherSuite/testInProcessLauncher/history/]

 

Per Marcelo's suggestion, I'm going to (only) disable this test in 2.3. The master builds are failing similarly ([https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-2.7/4426/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.launcher/SparkLauncherSuite/testInProcessLauncher/history/)] so I hope it'll not hinder any investigation.

It's getting harder and harder to reproduce these races locally... this one may take a while.

Things look pretty stable on master, so I'll post a backport for 2.3.1 so we get the fixes in the next maintenance release.

Hi, All.

This seems to fail again in branch 2.3. Can we disable this in branch-2.3 for Apache Spark 2.3.1 at least?

If that still fails somewhere it means there is still a bug somewhere. I don't think disabling the test is the right thing unless it's actually common enough that it's causing problems. Lots of our tests are flaky.

That's like the only failure recently, BTW.
