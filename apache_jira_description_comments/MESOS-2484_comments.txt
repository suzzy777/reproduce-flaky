see also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-1456 regarding metrics.

there's been some discussion about enforcing unique PID ids for every process but I can't find the relevant JIRA ticket.

Since we continually spawn new pids for little one of things, the blacklist of "used" pids would grow infinitely (Probably stay less than a couple MB for thousands of entries, but still...)

It should be fairly straightforward long term to just make it so when we do a process::terminate() that coordinates with Clock to remove all outstanding clocks destined for that process. If there is some sort of race where another process has the pid cached and is still sending stuff to it, that is probably a bug in the code for shutting down a particular process.

I have a patch to fix waiter specifically which I'll post the review for shortly / once it finishes passing my test build.
