LlapTaskCommunicator uses sync client to send task attempts. There are fixed number of communication threads (10 by default). This causes unneccessary delays when there are enough free execution slots in daemons but they do not receive all the tasks because of this bottleneck. LlapTaskCommunicator can use an async client to pass these tasks to daemons.Â
