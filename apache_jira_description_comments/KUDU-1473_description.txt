I've seen Java tests being flaky with this crash:

{code}
F0530 13:51:16.076247 30686 cow_object.h:82] Check failed: lock_.HasReaders() || lock_.HasWriteLock()
*** Check failure stack trace: ***

     @     0x7f8c52ce4ad7  kudu::master::CatalogManagerBgTasks::Run()  
{code}

It seems like this code path doesn't acquire the read lock on the tablet, and thus fires the assertion
