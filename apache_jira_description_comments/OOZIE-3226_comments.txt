Thanks for reporting [~alishap]. I believe this test is flaky. I moved this under OOZIE-3111.

Hi [~pbacsko], thanks for the update. I would like to mention that, the test case testOozieDBCLI() passes individually on our local environment. Whereas, it fails consistently when the suit is run. I believe it should be because of some recent changes made through OOZIE-3192.

Yes, it started to fail after OOZIE-3192, although it's not directly caused by that change.

I can see two problems:
1. The method {{setUp()}} is marked with {{@BeforeClass}} but it does not have any effect, because JUnit3 test runner is selected for this class. The annotation is ignored.
2. Therefore {{setUp()}} runs again before {{testOozieDBCLI}} but this time the Derby database is not re-created. I'm not sure why, perhaps something is stored in a static field which prevents Derby from creating the database files again.

Anyway the root cause has been found and I'll upload the fix soon.

[~andras.piros] [~gezapeti] please verify the proposed change.

Minor fix: {{dataBaseCreated}} should be spelled as {{databaseCreated}} (lower-case "b").

Thanks for the patch [~pbacsko]! I like the direction of the change, the root cause might be caused indeed by some {{static}} initializer block e.g. in {{derby}} code.

Nit: please employ {{\@Override}} annotation and {{super}} calls in {{setUp()}} and {{tearDown()}}.

The change seems reasonable. I'll wait for Jenkins to see if the test case itself is fixed. 
I don't see a nice way to do @BeforeClass in Junit3 executor so we have to live with this workaround until the XTestCase is rewritten to Junit4
