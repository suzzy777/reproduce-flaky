I'm not sure what the "correct" behavior is in this situation where the SolrCore is not available ... do nothing? throw an Exception?

I think the right thing to do is simply do nothing. https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/794

I only vaguely remember this issue, but yeah, "do nothing" is probably fine.

Have you by any chance been able to reliably reproduce & test this fix in the "core is closing" situation?

I'm wondering if "do nothing" here just kicks the can down the road and causes the caller(s) of this method to get a similar failure somewhere else (or worse: start making some on disk changes that fail part way through)

I merely observed it in a test where it was clear based on logs that the core was closing.  I hear you on "kick the can" -- so I looked a bit to see who calls it and what happens and there isn't an obvious follow-on error that might happen but who knows.  I'd rather merge this as progress not perfection.  If one of us sees some further ramifications then we'll deal with that if/when there is more to do.
