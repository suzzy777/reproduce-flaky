I actually believe this isn't specific to the Kafka Channel and applies to all live config updates in Flume when removing values and therefore expecting them to go back to defaults.

[~tmgstev]: thank you for the bug report

Would you like to provide a patch for it or would you like me to assign the ticket to myself and start working on it?


[~bessbd] Please take this one - hopefully it's a simple fix :)

[~bessbd] I think I have a fix for this - do you mind if I take it back?

[~tmgstev]: awesome!

Please, go ahead and reassign

Patch attached - it's a simple fix and I've added tests that definitely failed before and definitely pass now. [~bessbd] Do you think it needs a review board?

+1, LGTM

I've checked: it doesn't seem to break anything and the tests seem to be correct, too.


Side-note: we should check other sources/channels/sinks for such problems

Thanks [~bessbd]

As a quick test, I've just inspected the following sources/sinks/channels:

:~/Git/flume$ find . -name '*.java' | xargs grep -C3 'putAll' | grep getSubProperties
./flume-ng-channels/flume-jdbc-channel/src/main/java/org/apache/flume/channel/jdbc/impl/JdbcChannelProviderImpl.java-    Map<String, String> sysPropsNew = context.getSubProperties(

./flume-ng-sources/flume-kafka-source/src/main/java/org/apache/flume/source/kafka/KafkaSource.java:    kafkaProps.putAll(ctx.getSubProperties(KafkaSourceConstants.KAFKA_CONSUMER_PREFIX));


All of those above seem to be okay (i.e. they are preceded by a re-initialisation). I would think that as most things use Context.get{type}(String name, [default-value]) we should be okay.

[~bessbd] - thanks for pointing me in the right direction on this one - much appreciated.

[~tmgstev]: I'll update the issue title according to the patch you've submitted to include (Kafka-) Source & Sink, too.

[~tmgstev]: The changes seem all fine, but when I was doing a last check, I've come across an issue:
When I'm running the test for KafkaSource in debug mode, it seems to throw an exception in the middle and never run the asserts. (Which is silent, because there is a throws Exception on the method.)

The problem seems to be around
{noformat}String topic = findUnusedTopic();
kafkaServer.createTopic(topic, 1);{noformat}

I think, removing the parts of the test method that are not directly testing the current change would help.

Can you please make a few changes to the patch? (Or let me know if I'm wrong.)


Thank you

PS. maybe a reviewboard request could help to discuss the code

Actually it's not silent, the test fails due to the exception.
{noformat}
kafka.admin.AdminOperationException: replication factor: 1 larger than available brokers: 0

	at kafka.admin.AdminUtils$.assignReplicasToBrokers(AdminUtils.scala:77)
	at kafka.admin.AdminUtils$.createTopic(AdminUtils.scala:236)
	at kafka.admin.AdminUtils.createTopic(AdminUtils.scala)

	at org.apache.flume.source.kafka.TestKafkaSource.testDefaultSettingsOnReConfigure(TestKafkaSource.java:632)
	...
{noformat}

I agree with Donat, I also think that there is no need for starting the whole kafka source, calling two {{configure}}s with different context should be enough, as the context's properties are copied to the {{kafkaProps}} in {{KafkaSource}}, which is checked by the test. We'd hit two birds with one stone by removing the unneeded lines: the test would be simpler and the above mentioned issue wouldn't come up.

+1 to not needing to start the source... however the test shouldn't be failing for that reason, and it doesn't fail for me. I'll remove the code, but there may be some flakiness that needs investigating. I'll raise a review board with an updated patch


Posted original and revised patch to review board. Link attached.

LGTM, +1

I'm about to commit this

Commit 14fb4d84fd0e100253ca947bc96810c242e7a82b in flume's branch refs/heads/trunk from [~tmgstev]
[ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=flume.git;h=14fb4d8 ]

FLUME-2857. Make Kafka Source/Channel/Sink restore default values when live updating config

This commit changes Kafka Channel, Sink and Source to fix an error where
sub-configurations aren't tolerant of the configure() method being called more
than once (as happens when a Live Config Update happens).
