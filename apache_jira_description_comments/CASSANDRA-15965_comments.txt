I was able to reproduce this in only 59 runs the first time, but after adding some debug logging in AsyncStreamingInputPlus.unsafeAvailable, I'm unable to repro in thousands of runs. There is clearly some kind of timing issue here, but I'm not familiar enough with Netty to know exactly where.

My recommendation is to remove the test. It's testing so very little (we can queue a message), and so fundamental -- I believe we have quite a bit of coverage for this elsewhere.

While looking at this I discovered a possible NPE in StreamMessage type lookups. The lookup table had a null value in the zero index. I'm including a potential fix for that.

I'm fine with removing the test,  but for the NPE can we add one?

Yes. And frankly I'm embarrassed the first PR didn't include one. I think I had it in my head that I was just tidying existing functionality. I'll update today.

Presently trying to figure out why circleci won't create a workflow for this commit.

If it is a timing issue in the {{channelRead_Normal}} test, {{Util#spinAssertEquals}} could be an alternative, and the test can be kept. 

Do we want to open a new ticket for fixing the NPE? A bit of trouble, but the new ticket can better describe the goal of the patch. This one just reports a flaky test.

It's not a matter of the test thread getting there too early -- it gets there too late and the condition will never be true. By then the buffer has been read.

>Do we want to open a new ticket for fixing the NPE?
In the past we've included production code changes in the flaky test ticket that discovered them. I will open a new ticket if that's needed. lmk. 

I don't have much preference on new ticket or not; we don't mention test fixes in the changelog, but I'll appropriately put an entry about the NPE fix and we can even rename the ticket.  Or just make another one, whichever.

bq. it gets there too late and the condition will never be true.

Thanks for the clarification. Yeah. Spin assert won't help in this case. 


The fix will go into the change log. So either change both the ticket title and description (which seems messy), or just create a new ticket and link to this one, so the context is not lost. 

Committed the test removal.
