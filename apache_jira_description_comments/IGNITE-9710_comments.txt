    GridCachePartitionExchangeManager#init wrapped by blocking section

----


Wrapping entire {{GridDhtPartitionsExchangeFuture.init()}} into blocking section is too rough solution. By doing this we in fact make partition-exchanger thread not critical.

To fix the issue thoroughly, {{init()}} body should be examined, and long running operations should be interleaved with {{GridWorker.updateHeartbeat()}} calls or wrapped into critical sections, depending on the situation.

    IGNITE-9710 Fixing blocking sections.

----


[~agoncharuk], could you please review the change [1] ?

[1] https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/4962

[~andrey-kuznetsov] I've found a mistake a-la copy&paste. See upsource comments.

[~andrey-kuznetsov], in my opinion, such approach to caches start defeats the purpose of the watchdog service. All potentially dangerous operations are now wrapped in {{blockingSectionBegin/blockingSectionEnd}}. Instead, we should insert thread progress markers to all loops where we iterate over caches (for example, inside {{forAllRegisteredCacheGroups}}) and over partitions. This way we will still report a long-running disk IO operations, but will tolerate a large number of starting caches.

[~agoncharuk], [~agura], thanks for your comments. I've made all required changes. I had to update progress marker for exchanger worker from threads other than exchanger thread. Are you ok with this? 

TeamCity (re)tests are in progress right now.

TeamCity tests were passed successfully.

[~andrey-kuznetsov] I think we can merge this version for 2.7, and I will think a little bit more how we can reduce the number of the blocking sections in exchange future.

Don't believe TC Bot this time: the test mentioned is flaky.

[~andrey-kuznetsov] LGTM. Merged to master and ignite-2.7 branches. Thanks for contribution!
