Current commit message is inaccurate:
"SENTRY-1429, SENTRY-1455: fix flaky TestHDFSIntegration, refactor this huge test class, improve its cleanUp and setUp for temp HDFS dirs; divide test class into smoke test class and p2 test class; in post commit run, we will only run smoke tests."
Seems like it should just be 
"SENTRY-1454:Fix intermittent time out issue for TestHDFSIntegration
" 
-  SENTRY-1429 is the uber jira, but we do not have to mention it in the commit description. Can be added to extended description if needed.
- SENTRY-1455 seems not related?

Also, a new file TestHDFSIntegrationEnd2End.java does not seem to have license header. This needs to be fixed.
