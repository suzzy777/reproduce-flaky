i also encounter this bug when i make check. Does it matter? If matters, how should i fix it?

Which version were you running?

mesos-0.12.0-incubating




You can safely ignore this, it's a bug in a method called only for testing. The fix is here:

commit 84b2ce62637eafbfc1f9383ae78a8b689bea5163
Author: Benjamin Mahler <bmahler@twitter.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 19 12:00:46 2013 -0700

    Fixed a bug in http::get when called with an empty query. Added the Host header to be HTTP 1.1 compliant.

    Review: https://reviews.apache.org/r/12773

And will make it's way into 0.14.0, unless it gets cherry picked for 0.13.0.
