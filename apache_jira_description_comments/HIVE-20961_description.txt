Right now we have coalesce and nvl implemented separetly; it might be better to remove one of them as they are doing the same. Because Coalesce is in the standard -  I think NVL have to go...and became an alias to Coalesce.

Further benefit is: that optimizations which coalesce already recieves; will be done on NVL calls as well.
