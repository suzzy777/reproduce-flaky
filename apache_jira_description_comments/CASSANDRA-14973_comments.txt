[JAVA-2704|https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/JAVA-2704] is the related ticket on the Java Driver side

ML thread on this [here|https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rc5f5222219f31f595f75cfa3e9672c0a7069a55c4d93982e384d0054%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E].

Hey [~samt], [~eduard.tudenhoefner], [~ifesdjeen]

I was wondering what is the latest plan for this ticket? 

Thanks [~mck] for attaching the mail thread. 

I see JAVA-2704 in review? 

{quote}I was wondering what is the latest plan for this ticket? {quote}

I have the patch ready for Cassandra, plus one for JAVA-2705 (java driver 3.x) and PYTHON-1232. I just need to hook them all together along with cassandra-dtest and get CI passing. Hopefully I will have time to do that next week.

Great, thanks for the super quick response [~samt]! Appreciate it :) 

(And all the work, of course!)

I've pushed some branches/opened some PRs:

||C*||dtests||java driver||python driver||
|[14973-trunk|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra/commits/14973-trunk]|[14973|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra-dtest/tree/14973]|[PR 1529|https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/pull/1529]|[PR 1098|https://github.com/datastax/python-driver/pull/1098]|

Cirlce CI running against all the dev branches: [CircleCI | https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/beobal/cassandra?branch=14973-trunk] (ci-cassandra to follow).
Regarding the C* branch, the first 2 commits ([f373e8b|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra/commit/f373e8b720ba9667746a08ff5951cbd63c615716],      [2acc380|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra/commit/2acc380096675f5531758960356f2674ad133ed8]) replace the bundled java & python drivers with dev snapshots including JAVA-2705 & PYTHON-1232. 

The next 4 commits ([4b4788f|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra/commit/4b4788f515b6c31d74f6147a2172854ac1e1e76b], [110ba41|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra/commit/110ba4157887e0853b79109007cccdf35db9b942], [0aae5b4| https://github.com/beobal/cassandra/commit/0aae5b4921a3ce6c21a8a0e977624c877b19cd5b], [9f38772|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra/commit/9f387727692235f41a6efc0cd96a533c9109f4fa]) contain the main C* changes, including one bugfix to multi-frame messages that running the dtests against v5 exposed. 

The penultimate commit ([a3e60ee|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra/commit/a3e60eed523529b4461888b2059c428714e5ff5a]), contains the temporary changes to have CI run against the corresponding dtest branch, using docker images built with a compatible version of the python driver. This commit and the two bundling the driver snapshots won't be committed here. The proposal is that if we can get PYTHON-1232 and JAVA-2705 committed to their respective trunks, we can immediately build bundles which reference the SHA1s and drop them in here. We should then be good to commit this following review & a final clean CI run. We can follow up with CASSANDRA-13951 to replace those in-tree driver binaries with release artifacts whenever the drivers next cut those releases.

The dtest changes can be merged at any time, but will cause failures until the python driver's {{cassandra-test}} branch includes PYTHON-1232 and the main C* patch is landed. 


+1 on Cassandra patch 

Thanks [~ifesdjeen]. 

[~eduard.tudenhoefner]: now that the java and python drivers have been updated, I've switched the bundled artifacts to ones built from the upstream source trees, referencing the sha1s. I've also rebased and squashed the C* changes, removing the temporary commits that were there for running CI. Do you have time to check out the latest changes? 

CI is currently running: [Circle|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/beobal/cassandra?branch=14973-trunk], [Apache|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/patches/job/Cassandra-devbranch/394/]

Looking at the CI results:
* the jvm-dtest failure looks unrelated, but I'll file a JIRA to investigate. That fixture, {{CASTest}} has historically been flaky, so perhaps CASSANDRA-16355 didn't catch all issues. I'll file a JIRA to investigate  
* the failures on each of the cqlsh_dtests jobs are all coming from either {{TestCqlshCopy}} and pass locally or {{test_cqlsh.py::TestCqlsh::test_protocol_negotiation}} which is fixed in my [dtest branch|https://github.com/beobal/cassandra-dtest/tree/14973]
* the jvm_upgrade_dtest failure, {{MixedModeReadTest::mixedModeReadColumnSubsetDigestCheck}} is addressed by CASSANDRA-16415

Otherwise, the results so far look pretty reasonable.


I spoke to [~eduard.tudenhoefner] & [~adutra] offline & everyone was happy to merge now, so I've committed to trunk in {{c9d6c725dd0b4aa5693eb1c6d2221c28e9e99c6e}}.

I've opened a [dtest pr|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/pull/127] with the minor changes required there. Only {{test_cqlsh.py::TestCqlsh::test_protocol_negotiation}} should actually break without the dtest change.

+1 to dtest fix.

Sorry [~brandon.williams], I just found another place that needed tweaking in the dtests, so I've pushed an additional commit to that branch.

You cannot deter me, +1.
