   Windows 2016 Visual Studio 2017 failed [because tar was missing](https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/builds/21442020).  I'll leave it to @pdxcodemonkey or @mikemartell to decide if this PR should be reran through CI before merging

   Seemed rude not to bump the other dependencies after doing ACE, so here is another one
   May also conflict with #899
   
   maybe some day I'll look into dependabot so this type of bumping can be automated

[~bbender]Â  anything left to do on this ticket? may we resolve & close?

gaussianrecurrence commented on PR #899:
URL: https://github.com/apache/geode-native/pull/899#issuecomment-1248021514

   Considering geode-native is not using ACE anymore and SQLite was already updated, and also there is another PR to update Boost, maybe this can be closed @pivotal-jbarrett ?
