Problem commit suppused to be: [https://github.com/apache/ignite/commit/2b5d2fc5fee9b8d722f919b2d92750f139d07876]

e.g. adds 3 minutes (total in each test) just without any valuable results
org/apache/ignite/internal/processors/cache/transactions/TxRollbackAsyncTest.java:762

[~dpavlov], [~ascherbakov]

Hello! Will you have time to look at this? From my point, {{TxRollbackAsyncTest}} this class leads to  execution timeout results. I'm not familiar with Tx, suppose you can find root cause faster than me.

Failed in {{master}} again:

||Branch|| \# ||Results||Started||
|refs/heads/master|#939|Execution timeout (new)|17 May 18 00:15|

I've failed test TxRollbackAsyncTest#testMixedAsyncRollbackTypes with reference to issue.

[~dpavlov] I can pick this ticket up if nobody mind ?

I've also failed test TxRollbackOnTimeoutTest.testRandomMixedTxConfigurations with reference to this issue

[~Alexey Kuznetsov], IMO [~ascherbakov] will fix this test quite fast, so I suggest to wait for some time.

    IGNITE-8509 Fixed race in TxRollbackAsyncTest.

----


So far I've found race condition in TxRollbackAsyncTest suite leading to test assertion failures.

Affected tests: testSynchronousRollback, testMixedAsyncRollbackTypes.

Fixed, multiple TC runs in progress.

[~ascherbakov] hi. 
Are you going to fix test TxRollbackOnTimeoutNearCacheTest#testRandomMixedTxConfigurations in this ticket ?
Or it should be fixed within https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-8297 ?


Alexey,

I have plans to check all flaky tests from the suite.

If you want you can start looking at IGNITE-8297 to speed up things.

Let me know if you will discover issues.

Another issue is solved in linked IGNITE-8863

Thanks, merged to master.
