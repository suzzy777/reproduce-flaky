URL: https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1813
 
 
   The EVF framework is set up to return a "fast schema" empty batch with only schema as its first batch because, when the code was written, it seemed that's how we wanted operators to work. However, DRILL-7305 notes that many operators cannot handle empty batches.
   
   Since the empty-batch bugs show that Drill does not, in fact, provide a "fast schema" batch, this ticket asks to disable the feature in the new scan framework. The feature is disabled with a config option; it can be re-enabled if ever it is needed.
   
   Old tests validate the original schema-batch mode, new tests added to validate the no-schema-batch mode.

   @arina-ielchiieva, regarding `enableSchemaBatch`, recall that Java boolean variables are, by definition in the language spec, set to false. So, since we never set it to true, except in tests, it always defaults to false.
   
   Since this was confusing, added Javadoc to explain the problem and the default setting of the option. Does this new material answer your question?

   When running tests there are unit and functional test failures. Please run full unit tests suit locally before making the PR, Travis does not do that.

   Addressed the TestEmptyInputSql failure. The code now recognizes two cases:
   
   1. Empty results: the reader provided a schema, but had no rows. (This is the case that failed.)
   2. Null results: the reader provides neither rows nor schema. This is the case that was always being followed, even if we have a schema.
   
   Changed the query builder row set code to return an empty row set if the output contains only an empty batch and contains a schema. The code continues to return no row set if the result is null. (Oddly, Drill will return a batch with no rows and no schema if the reader returns no batches at all.)
   
   Will address other issues in separate commits.

   When running the full tests, the following failed in `java-exec`:
   
   ```
   [ERROR] Errors: 
   [ERROR]   TestDynamicUDFSupport.testReRegisterTheSameJarWithDifferentContent:600->BaseTestQuery.testRunAndReturn:340 » Rpc
   ```
   
   When running this unit test in Eclipse, two tests failed: `testDropFunction` and `testSuccessfulRegistrationAfterSeveralRetryAttempts`. Then, `testConcurrentRemoteRegistryUpdateWithDuplicates` hung forever.
   
   I believe these tests (and one other that I can't recall) seem to fail about 50% of the time on my builds.
   
   The workaround seems to be to rebuild all of Drill. That is, the rough pattern seems to be that this test will run once after a clean build, but will fail if run a second time or after a code change. Not sure if this is the exact pattern; something like this happens.
   
   The result is that it is hard to tell if my code broke something or if the tests are just flaky. I wonder, is there something we can do to stabilize these tests? All other tests run fine if I rerun them a second time on the same build or after I make a small code change.
   
   Anyway, after doing a full rebuild and retest, this commit does pass all unit tests.

 Review comment:
   I am not sure why your IDE makes static imports on the top of the list, I think its more common when they are in the end. I think all Drill project follows this convention...

 Review comment:
   Sorry, I've manually put the imports back and have updated the Eclipse rules to put static imports after the others.
   
   As it turns out, the Eclipse style rules on the Drill web site are not valid for the latest Eclipse: "Import failed. This is not a faled profile: Expected `CleanUpProfile` but encountered `CodeFormatterProfile`. So, I've been using the Eclipse default profile with a few adjustments per the [web site](http://drill.apache.org/docs/apache-drill-contribution-guidelines/). The web site does not mention a preferred import order.
   
   I have tried disabling the auto-update of imports so that files are left unchanged. However, this tends to leave unused imports which then cause the build to fail and take a long time to fix manually.
   
   Best solution: update the Eclipse settings file both to make it valid and to include any missing style rules. Then, I'll update my IDE to enforce the project's preferred standards.

   @arina-ielchiieva, please review the recent changes to this PR. If more comments, I'll go ahead and address them. Once you are satisfied, and provide a +1, I'll create a single merge branch with this PR, DRILL-6951 and DRILL-7293.
   
   I will run the complete unit tests. But, I'm afraid I must ask you to run the functional tests as I don't have a MFS or Hadoop cluster available to run that test suite.

   Oh my. We're moving in the wrong direction. I'll need to take a deeper look in a day or two.
   
   I wonder, if I just check out the test suite, do I get the data files? Or, are they generated using Hive? Once I have the files, I should be able to reproduce the issues with a single-node Drill. If the files are generated, can you post several of the files somewhere so I can grab them? Thanks.

   Thanks, @arina-ielchiieva, for pointing me to the Parquet data sources. As it turns out, I don't think that is the correct set of files used by the test. If I manually count the matches for the "union03" query, I get three rows out of a total of 1500 rows in the customer table. The expected results shown in your earlier post show customer IDs beyond 1500, suggesting that the failed query ran against a larger file than the one in the directory you suggested.

   Any suggestions for how to proceed?

   Thanks, @arina-ielchiieva, for pointing me to the Parquet data sources. As it turns out, I don't think that is the correct set of files used by the test. If I manually count the matches for the "union03" query, I get three rows out of a total of 1500 rows in the customer table. The expected results shown in your earlier post show customer IDs beyond 1500, suggesting that the failed query ran against a larger file than the one in the directory you suggested.

   Looking closer, it seems that the files in the test framework are for scale factor (SF) 0.1. But, the tests use files for SF1. So, I suspect I'm testing against files 1/10 the size of those used in the tests that failed. I'm guessing the test framework generates the SF1 files during its setup phase (which seems to require MFS to run.)
   
   Further, I'm completely mystified at how my changes could impact Parquet since the only changed source files are for the "new" scan, which Parquet does not use. Oddly, none of the text file queries fail; which is the area I *did* change.

   Thanks, @arina-ielchiieva, for pointing me to the Parquet data sources. As it turns out, these failures are quite a mystery.
   
   First, I don't think the files you mentioned are those used by the tests that failed. The set stored on GitHub is for scale factor (SF) 0.1 which has 1500 customers in the customer table with ids from 0 to 1499. The tests seem to use SF1 which, perhaps, is generated by the test framework during its setup. If we look at the union03 query, the expected results include customer IDs in the six-digit range.
   
   That said, I did recreate the union03 query locally, using the SF0.1 files and got 3 result rows. To verify, I wrote a test that scanned the entire table (just a `SELECT * FROM ...`), and "manually" applied the where clause. Three rows matched. So, looks like, at least locally, that particular query works OK against the SF0.1 data set.
   
   Unfortunately, I can't check the contents of the `customer.parquet` file because I can't get Parquet tools to work after several hours of fighting one thing after another. I seem to recall we discussed bundling that tool with Drill. Doing so would be very handy. Building by hand requires far more steps than is documented in the Parquet and HortonWorks web site: 1) install gcc, 2) download and compile thrift, 3) build Parquet-tools, 4) figure out the set of dependent jars that must be on the class path, 5)... not sure, here is where I gave up in frustration...
   
   Taking a step back, I'm actually completely mystified at how my changes could impact Parquet (only). This PR only changed source files are for the "new" scan, which Parquet does not use. Oddly, none of the text file queries fail; which is the one area I *did* change.
   
   Were the parquet files used in the tests rebuilt recently? Might there be a problem with the data itself?
   
   Just to make sure I'm tracking down the correct issue: does the master branch pass these same tests? Using the same data files (that is, using the same cluster without rebuilding the functional tests?) Perhaps try testing the log regex or mock PRs. They are rebased on the same master version as this PR. But, they include a distinct set of changes. If those PRs pass, then the problem is somewhere in this PR. If those {Rs have failures, then perhaps we want to double-check the test framework data.
   
   While that is done, I will continue to try to find a way to track down the issue (without access to the test framework or the SF1 data...)

URL: https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1813#issuecomment-508966464
 
 
   @arina-ielchiieva, very sorry for the trouble that PR has caused. Thank you for the SF1 data. It allowed me to find the offending change and fix the issue.
   
   This is a case of "no good deed goes unpunished." I tried to work around the bad code explained in DRILL-7308 by setting precision only if non-zero. For reasons I did not track down, this change caused some part of the TPC-H queries to fail.
   
   The failure was in the "tuple/column metadata" classes. I had not realized that these classes are now used outside of just the new scan and schema work. (I did not track down the usage.)
   
   This exercise shows that Drill requires the following rules regarding precision:
   
   * Precision must be set for all types that need it (including VarChar and Decimal.)
   * Precision must be set for these types even if the value is zero.
   * Code that wants to know if the precision is non-zero should check the precision value itself. Code should not use an "is set" check as a substitute for "value != 0". (This is the flaw in the REST code described in DRILL-7308.)
   
   Filed DRILL-7318 to suggest we clean up and standardize our type-to-string implementations so that they build type strings based on the above rules.
   
   Reverted the precision-related change in {{PrimitiveColumnMetadata}}. The TPC-H union03 query now passes locally. I presume the others will also.
   
   The reversion caused a test to fail. It seems that the `EXPLAIN PLAN` for the new schema provisioning stuff uses the `toString()` method to get the type string shown in the plan for a provided schema. Not sure this is the best idea because `toString()` is for debugging and uses internal type names. It also shows the precision and scale for all types, resulting in the output `INT(0, 0):OPTIONAL`. (The type names and cardinality notation should be fixed as part of DRILL-7318.)
   
   The reverted change had removed the unwanted precision and scale. By reverting the change, the unwanted precision and scale returned. So, for now, I modified `MaterializedField.toString()` to not emit the precision if the value is zero (unless the type is Decimal.) `EXPLAIN PLAN` now produces `INT:OPTIONAL` (without the precision and scale.)
   
   Left the changes as a new commit so you can review just the new changes.
   
   Please try this PR again against the functional tests. Let's hope this time things work this time. If so, I'll squash commits. We talked about creating a merge branch with the three open PRs. Since you need to run the functional tests again to verify the fix, do you want to then just commit this PR? I can create a merge branch for the other two. Otherwise, I'm happy to create a merge branch with all three.

   @arina-ielchiieva, thank you for running the tests. Glad to hear we finally have a clean run.
   
   I've squashed commits. Since this PR has been a struggle, let's do commit it by itself. Once that is done, I will rebase the other two PRs, then combine them into a single merge branch for your convenience.
