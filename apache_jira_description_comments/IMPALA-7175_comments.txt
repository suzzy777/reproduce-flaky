There was no crash in the logs, so something must be incorrect when determining the number of impalad processes.

I see the following that's due to the ImpalaCluster() call on L325: 

MainThread: Found 2 impalad/1 statestored/1 catalogd process(es)

The test is run multiple times and all of the other runs it look like this:

MainThread: Found 1 impalad/1 statestored/1 catalogd process(es)

 

I see a lot of these types of messages that are likely thrown at L132 when a listed process is not found:

MainThread: no process found with pid 20961

...

For ee-tests, I assume the cluster nodes are *not* expected to be killed or die. 

IMPALA-7175: deflake check for failed impalad

 
test_native_functions_race checks for an impalad crash by testing whether the number of impalads at the start and end of the test is the same. A recent run was flaky since the number of impalads at the start was incorrectly found to be 2. This fix tries to make the test most robust by determining the number of impalads based on how many can evaluate a trivial test query. For these tests, its assumed that the number of coordinators is the same as the number of impalads in the cluster.
