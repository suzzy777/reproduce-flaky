Missed in earlier rebase, need to serialize MemtableParams when saving a snapshot

[CEP-21] Upgrading a one node cluster to TCM fails attempting Gossip shadow round
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/8bcd581fc4
Upgrading fails due to first upgraded node waiting for gossip state from peers.

[CEP-21] Implement replacement with same address
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/c1e94aa21a
Add back missing replace with same address feature

[CEP-21] fix nodetool bootstrap resume
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/2265c4b615
Add back missing nodetool bootstrap resume feature

[CEP-21] Remove LEFT peers from system tables and exclude them during startup
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/2aef6f6a96
Avoid trying to gossip with LEFT peers

[CEP-21] Fix flaky distributed log test. While it fails very infrequently on CI, it consistently fails locally.
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/6ea5042618
Test fix

[CEP-21] Retry indefinitely for STARTUP messages.
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/5924404bd6
If the CMS is down and we try to upgrade an instance we should block until the CMS comes back

[CEP-21] Implement versioning for ranges
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/ef1ad17669
To be able to know if the coordinator has the correct ring view we keep track of when a range was last updated. If coordinator has not seen this update we fail the request.

https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/d0367189da
Code cleanup

https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/ce7511f2ec
Avoid getting multiple client warnings

[CEP-21] Validate schema alterations on coordinator
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/bf9169683b

[CEP-21] Add a script for simulation running
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/599d6f70a3

[CEP-21] Add nextId to Directory serialization and make it possible to bump metadata serialization version
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/6dd4c92797
Previously, on bounce, each instance calculated which nodeId we should give a new node by counting the number of instances in the cluster, this can diverge so that different nodes have different ids. Fixed by serializing the current nextId when storing snapshot.

[CEP-21] Add metric for CMS membership
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/5dfb270d92

[CEP-21] Reenable starting without joining (-Dcassandra.join_ring=false)
https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/bd1e9da2f8
Add back missing join_ring=false feature.
