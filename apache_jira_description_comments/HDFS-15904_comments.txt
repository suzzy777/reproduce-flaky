Approved PR and left some minor message.

Not sure about HBase, but in Hadoop, before merging we only need to set target versions for a JIRA. When committing, the committer will set the "Fixed Versions" to indicate which branch this patch eventually goes into. Thanks,

Thanks a lot [~liuml07] for providing all nice mandatory info.

Committed to Hadoop 3
