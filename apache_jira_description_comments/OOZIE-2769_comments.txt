removed a test for setReplication as that's tested by API upstream, otherwise requires to wait for replicated blocks, if still there's value for it, I can implement wait logic.

Thanks for the contribution [~dbist13]!
We have some flaky tests around unfortunately, {{testMemoryUsageAndSpeedOverflowToDisk}} is one of them. It can be ignored.

Some thoughts on your patch:
# Please check the patch for trailing whitespaces and remove them
# I would add the test back. It was failing because it's checking for the replication factor of the {{path}} instead of the {{outputFile}}:
{code}
ae.setrep(context, *outputFile*, (short) 3);
assertEquals(fs.getFileStatus(*path*).getReplication(), 3);
{code}
Please switch the arguments for {{assertEquals}}, the expected value should be the first one.
# I don't think there's a need for {{setrep(Context context, XConfiguration fsConf, Path nameNodePath, Path path, short replicationFactor)}}. I would simply inline it and use {{null}} where it's needed.
# Please add documentation for this feature in {{WorkflowFunctionalSpec.twiki}}


added test back and modified the twiki file [~gezapeti] thank you for reviewing. I also see it complains on one line being 132 chars long. I can't tell which line that is.

Thanks for the update!
Th long line was probably for the method {{setrep(Context context, XConfiguration fsConf, Path nameNodePath, Path path, short replicationFactor)}}. I think it still has two unnecessary parameters, which are always null and should be removed.
I don't know what's wrong with the test, but the test in patch-0 works if I change the {{path}} to {{outputFile}} in the asserts.

I haven't tried it out, but based on the code the documentation and the example should say
{noformat}
 <setrep path='[PATH]' replication-factor=n/>
{noformat}
or something like that.
Also, I've just noticed that the {{oozie-workflow-0.5.xsd}} have to be updated to accept the new command. 
Can you add a test with a workflow.xml file that uses this parameter?

[~gezapeti] what class do I add the test with workflow.xml, I found the following /core/src/test/resources/wf-schema-valid.xml is that what you had in mind?
Thank you, my test passes now also.

Yes, that would be a great place for the test. Also, adding other commands like thouchz is a good idea.

Some tests are still failing. 
The code seem fine now, the problem is in the xsd / xml files.
# the schema version in {{/core/src/test/resources/wf-schema-valid.xml}} have to be changed from 0.1 to 0.5
# the {{<setrep>}} element in {{/core/src/test/resources/wf-schema-valid.xml}} needs the {{replication-factor}} attribute.
# in {{oozie-workflow-0.5.xsd}} the SETREP type need a path attribute to work, preferably before the {{replication-factor}}. You may copy it over from the TOUCHZ type.
# I would change the type of the {{replication-factor}} from {{xs:string}} to {{"xs:unsignedShort"}} or {{xs:short}}
# the documentation of the setrep command is not correct in WorkflowFunctionalSpec, it does not have the number after the {{replication-factor}} attribute


[~gezapeti] I made the changes suggested but do you think changing type to short {{xs:short}} in schema would conflict with my code?
{code}
setrep(context, path, Short.parseShort(replicationFactor));
{code}

Thanks for the improvements [~dbist13]!
The xsd files are used to validate the workflow.xml files before processing them by Oozie. By defining the {{replication-factor}} as {{xs:short}} we'll reject workflows containing letters and too big numbers there. It won't affect the way the xml itself has to be processed.
+1 (non-binding) for the patch.

[~gezapeti] thank you for your +1, just for my own knowledge, what happens next, how many +1 do I need to have my patch committed to trunk? Btw, I saw in the build notes, lines > 132 characters is coming from other sources than mine. There are many different classes with that issue.

You have to get a +1 from one of the committers.
Let's ping [~abhishekbafna] and [~satishsaley] and ask for a review.

[~gezapeti] you're a committer now ;)

Oh, this totally slipped my mind. I'm sorry.
Can you rebase the patch? It does not apply to master anymore.

[~gezapeti] please review.
