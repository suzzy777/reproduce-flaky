Can you put whatever information you discovered here?

These tests are reusing the same database names and external table locations in all the tests so proper cleanup has to be done before starting new test.
As part of cleanup, HDFS location are deleted and re-created for each test. For some reason, sometime the HDFS PREFIX's stored by Sentry namenode plug-in are removed when the corresponding HDFS location is removed.  When the prefix is lost Sentry namenode plug-in will not add ACL rules for the paths for which it doesn't have a prefix.

This was causing the tests to fail.

Can you clarify where HDFS prefix is cleared? Where is it stored? Do you suspect someone who may clean it? What did you do to get around the issue?

Did you just moved several tests from TestHDFSIntegrationAdvanced to independent class? How did it fix anything? 

[~akolb] Yes, the first patch was just moving tests to another test class. 
I narrowed that these tests were messing something causing other tests to fail. I did not nail the reason. 

Now I found it, one of the test was issuing a wrong command which was causing issue for namenode plug-in  and subsequent process subsequent events are not processed by namenode plug-in.
This change set just fixes the test failure. We need to fix the actual problem

1. Properly validate the command in the sentry plug-in for hive
2. namenode plug-in should continue processing the rest of the notifications even on failures.

Please see the new patch. It is just one line change.

What is this wrong command? Is it a problem with the test or with the code? What is the actual problem?

What is wrong with a create grant on a database? What harm is it causing? Is there any reason why these tests sometime pass and sometimes fail?

[~akolb] Currently sentry doesn't support fine grained privileges. It only supports SELECT,INSERT and all privileges.

When a privilege is added, this validation is not done and the privilege is added. Namenode plug-in logic throws Exception that it is an invalid action. When it does it, Seq number is not updated and Namenode plug-in will be stuck there and subsequent updates will not be processed.

As i said,
1. Command has to be properly validated.
2. namenode plug-in should continue processing the rest of the notifications even on failures.


*Reason for the flakiness:* Order in which the tests are executed vary in each run. If test "testURIsWithoutSchemeandAuthority" is ran before the other tests like testAuthzObjOnPartitionMultipleTables which have success check's, they fail.

Loosing HDFS prefix is random. It is not seen every time. Let me elaborate the issue

HMSPaths, class is the the one that stores object to path mapping information. It has member variables 
{noformat}
  private volatile Entry root;
  private String[] prefixes;
{noformat}
prefixes is an array of prefixes for which sentry permissions are to be synced. root is is the root node of a tree which is constructed from these prefixes.
 When there is a path update, path should match the root tree in the HMSPaths. If it does not match, it indicates that the new path does not match to any of the configured prefixes. Such path's are ignored. In the middle of the tests one of the path in the prefix tree is lost.

This could be issue local to my setup because the tests are passing after fixing the invalid grant.

Fix for this issue is to update the test not to use "grant create on <object>" as it has issues with HDFS ACL synchronization.
SENTRY-1801  is created to address it.

[~kkalyan] Thank you for your contribution!

Interesting - this problem isn't present in master!

[~akolb] it is better to commit it to master well.

[~kkalyan] I can't commit it to master since master doesn't have this problem.
