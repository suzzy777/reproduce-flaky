[~mxm] is this a release blocker?

If yes, are you going to do the cherry pick after #7810

If no, could you remove the fix version for 2.11.

[~altay] I would consider it a release blocker. The PR should be merged today. I will cherry-pick to the release branch afterwards. 

I think we can remove it as a blocker for 2.11 but it will be good to get it in.

Â 

[~mxm] please let me know when this will be ready for a cherry pick.
