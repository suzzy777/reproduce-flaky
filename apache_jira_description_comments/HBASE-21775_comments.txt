Patch looks good [~tommyzli] Why would tablename be null do you think? What version of hbase are you running?

[~stack] from what I can see, tableName shouldn't be null unless you manually create a BufferedMutatorImpl instead of using ConnectionFactory.createConnection().getBufferedMutator(). I not sure if the bufferedmutator would work at all without a table name.

I'm running a build taken from master a few months ago, but I've seen the same issue in the latest release.

+1 on the patch.

Have you deployed this patch [~tommyzli] ? If so, does it make a difference sir?

[~stack] yes - ran a quick test where I killed the cluster while the ingestion process was running and confirmed that the buffered mutator picked up the new region locations when it came back up.

This patch should go everywhere it seems [~tommyzli]? branch-2 and branch-1. Thanks.

[~stack] It definitely needs to go to branch-2. I haven't tested this on version 1, but i took a brief look at the code and that condition is [the same|https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/branch-1.4/hbase-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/AsyncProcess.java#L1259] so yeah this can also go to branch-1

 

Pushed to branch-2.0+

[~apurtell] Want this in branch-1 sir? I can pull it back for you np.

Leaving open for the moment...

FYI for future [~tommyzli], commit message should start out with the JIRA number and subject. FYI. See git log. Next time sir. Thanks for the nice patch that probably took a long time to figure though it a one-liner.

+1
Please, thank you [~stack] 

Applied to branch-1.3+ but w/o the test since it uses branch-2-isms.

Did not go back to branch-1.2 so skipped it (shout if you want this and I'll shoehorn [~busbey])

This breaks TestAsyncProcess, please try to fix it. Plan release 2.1.3 and 2.0.5 because of a security issues so please be quick, otherwise will revert from at least branch-2.1 and branch-2.0.

Thanks.

[~tommyzli] If you are looking at this, just say, and I'll give it a go sir. Thanks.

I'm looking at this. [~Apache9] can you paste a link to output of the failed test? I'm not familiar with jenkins and am having trouble finding the failure

Does it pass locally for you [~tommyzli]?

I believe the mighty [~Apache9] is referring to this https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-2.1/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dashboard.html

It looks like the test fails 100% of the time in the flakey test finder. Click on the 'show' to look at particular failure types.

I took a look and the failures seem to be other tests, not TestAsyncProcess?

Yeah, does it pass locally for you?

So I pulled branch-2.1 and ran `mvn test -Dtest=org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestAsyncProcess -Dskip.license.check=true` locally both with my change and without, and I see the same 5 test failures in both runs. I've attached the surefire output of both runs. [^org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestAsyncProcess-without-HBASE-21775.txt] has one extra failure which is the test that I added.

 

Unless I'm looking at the wrong tests, I don't think the failures are introduced by my change

 

Thanks for the link, [~stack]. I took a look at the report from before my change went in and indeed TestAsyncProcess [is not listed there|https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-Find-Flaky-Tests/job/branch-2.1/168/artifact/dashboard.html]

 .Could this be a build caching issue?

On master branch if I revert the change here TestAsyncProcess can pass. And this maybe a test issue, as I suppose you changed the retry behavior here, and the failed UTs are all about how we do fail recovery, for example, testFail, testErrorServers, etc.

I was able to get a somewhat reliable local repro - will take a look later today

So what I noticed is that those five tests only fail when I run the entire test class, but running them individually always succeeds. The class has a static configuration that gets modified by some tests. When I changed the tests to create a new configuration per test, the tests stopped failing on my machine. I've uploaded HBASE-21775-ADDENDUM.master.001.patch with my changes

Thank you [~tommyzli]

On the addendum, it looks good but in future please don't do this (maybe you have to change your config on IDE?)

 -import org.junit.Assert;
 -import org.junit.BeforeClass;
 -import org.junit.ClassRule;
 -import org.junit.Test;
 +import org.junit.*;

I changed the addendum and fixed the checkstyle and applied the patch. Thank you.

Smile one of the checkstyle complaints was

./hbase-client/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/TestAsyncProcess.java:71:import org.junit.*;: Using the '.*' form of import should be avoided - org.junit.*. [AvoidStarImport]





Sorry about that [~stack], yeah I need to update my editor settings to match this project's styleguide

I pushed addendum on branch-2.0+ branch-1 doesn't do this static messing w/ CONF so it should be ok. Resolving.

This commit broke some tests on branch-1. See HBASE-21847 for one instance. Looks like there are others but I haven't bisected those failures yet.

Also TestRegionLocationCaching. There are others. I'm going to revert this from branch-1 for now. If we can get a replacement in before next RC (Monday Feb 11), then we can try again.

Reverted from the branch-1s.
