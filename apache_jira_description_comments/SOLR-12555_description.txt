I recently added some test code through SOLR-12427 which used the following test anti-pattern:

{code}
try {
    actionExpectedToThrowException();
    fail("I expected this to throw an exception, but it didn't");
catch (Exception e) {
    assertOnThrownException(e);
}
{code}

Hoss (rightfully) objected that this should instead be written using the formulation below, which is clearer and more concise.

{code}
SolrException e = expectThrows(() -> {...});
{code}

We should remove many of these older formulations where it makes sense.  Many of them were written before {{expectThrows}} was introduced, and having the old style assertions around makes it easier for them to continue creeping in.
