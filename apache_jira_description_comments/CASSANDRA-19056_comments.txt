The test was flaky pre-TCM but in a different way so there is some change in behavior after the TCM patch:

This is with the TCM patch

https://github.com/krummas/cassandra/commit/f395c60bc73e89714f31c741b51953e07ff93ce1

the reason is a race between creating the MV while we have ongoing writes - the MV is first added to TableViews before the schema is activated by committing the transformation. Patch just checks the cluster metadata if the MV is in the schema before it starts taking writes.

ci coming soon
