super useful tool, thanks [~bszabolcs]Â  for sharing!

does it worth to add this to the existing "SnapshotFormatter" tool (with some extra command line parameter)? Or easier to add as a separate tool?

It would be possible to add it to "SnapshotFormatter" and it might benefit from the addition of a custom starting node and depth limit but it would change the usage and I have not wanted to break an existing tool for others. Also it already has 2 separate recursive functions for the 2 different outputs and adding my solution (following the existing pattern) would increase that number to 4. So I felt it would be cleaner and easier to just create a separate tool.
