I have schema like “_id”,"address","borough","cuisine","grades".

Where grades is list of maps with elements like
{code}
[Document{{date=Fri May 14 05:30:00 IST 2021, grade=A, score=12.0}}, Document{{date=Wed Aug 13 05:30:00 IST 2025, grade=A, score=12.0}}, Document{{date=Sun Apr 04 05:30:00 IST 2027, grade=A, score=12.0}}] 
{code}

Now if I execute query like
{code}
DataSet ds = mongo.executeQuery("select * from restaurants where grades[0].grade='A'"); 
{code}
       
Its failing at line 427 of MongoDbContext class final Column column = item.getSelectItem().getColumn();

*Update*: But the real issue is not MongoDB specific. We just don't (yet) support traversing list/array objects like this. We support it with key/value maps, and even also when their values are list/array types, but not when the outer most type is a list/array.
