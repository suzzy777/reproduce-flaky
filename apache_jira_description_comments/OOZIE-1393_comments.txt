the oozie EmailActionExecutor doesn't support TLS yet. A fix is quite simple. It would need to do a transport.connect() first before doing .send()

[~dionusos] , as discussed I have attached the patch on this Jira.Â  Please see that if we can merge it to the main branch.

Thanks for the contribution [~mbalakrishnan]! Any ideas how to write automatic test case?

[~mbalakrishnan] can you please address {{RAW_PATCH_ANALYSIS}} and {{FINDBUGS_DIFF}} issues? Thanks!

PreCommit-OOZIE-Build started


Patch3 addresses the following:
* FINDBUGS_DIFF: use of variable [smtpStarttls]
* RAW_PATCH_ANALYSIS: there were no test case modification. In the current architecture it is not easy to test the use of the new property. However, there are some smtp variable string which are already defined in EmaiActionExecutor.java.

Thanks for the contribution [~dionusos]! Can you please extend also {{DG_EmailActionExtension.twiki}} by describing {{oozie.email.smtp.starttls.enable}} and having a small anonymous GMail account example? While you're at it, can you please also correct [HTML formatting errors|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12924589/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-22%20at%207.35.36%20PM.png] in the generated docs on the same section?

[~dionusos] this is strange, your patch could be applied locally. Re-uploading, maybe this helps.

[~andras.piros] thanks for the reapply, it worked.

Thanks for the contribution [~dionusos]! Failing test seems unrelated. Can you please work on {{DG_EmailActionExtension.twiki}} so that each modified line fits into 132 characters? Otherwise, the patch looks now really promising. Thanks!

Sure, thanks. I am on it already.
