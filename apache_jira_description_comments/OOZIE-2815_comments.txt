Thanks, Satish for review. Committed to master.

Reopening for amend patch to fix flaky test failures

Following tests were failing because Services singleton was null. It depends on the sequence of tests run, so sometimes we see success while running these tests with other tests. Fixing it by initializing Services.

[~satishsaley] [~puru] I can also state that following tests are flaky (actually, most of the time failing) on upstream master:
{noformat}

 T E S T S

Concurrency config is parallel='classes', perCoreThreadCount=false, threadCount=1, useUnlimitedThreads=false

One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.

bq. I can also state that following tests are flaky (actually, most of the time failing) on upstream master:
Yes. amend patch will fix these test failures like I mentioned above. 

[~satishsaley], please make sure that the {{Services}} used for testing is destroyed.
I'd suggest to use the pattern in [ActionExecutorTestCase|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/ActionExecutorTestCase.java#L65-L85]


[~satishsaley] can you please create the aforementioned amend patch fixing those flaky unit tests introduced? Thanks in advance.

[~satishsaley] early next week I'm gonna take the flaky test fix over for the win.
