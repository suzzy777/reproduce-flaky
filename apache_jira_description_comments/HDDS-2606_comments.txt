[~nanda]& [~elek] is this same as HDDS-2679 ?

HDDS-2679 should fix this issue, but we should check if we are running into some other issue that is getting exposed because of HDDS-2679.

If there are no piplines created after SCM startup, it should still be in safe mode.

Resolving this as there is no activity, let's reopen if we run into the issue again.
