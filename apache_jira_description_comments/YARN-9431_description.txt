In YARN-4901 one of the scheduler tests failed. This seems to be linked to the changes around the placement rules introduced in YARN-8967.

Applications submitted in the tests are accepted and rejected at the same time:
{code}
2019-04-01 12:00:57,269 INFO  [main] fair.FairScheduler (FairScheduler.java:addApplication(540)) - Accepted application application_0_0001 from user: user1, in queue: root.user1, currently num of applications: 1
2019-04-01 12:00:57,269 INFO  [AsyncDispatcher event handler] fair.FairScheduler (FairScheduler.java:rejectApplicationWithMessage(1344)) - Reject application application_0_0001 submitted by user user1 application rejected by placement rules.
{code}
This should never happen and is most likely due to the way the tests generates the application and events.
