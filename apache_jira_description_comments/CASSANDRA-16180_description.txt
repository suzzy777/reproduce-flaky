This is a subtask of CASSANDRA-15579 focusing on coordination.

I think that the main reference dtest for this is [consistency_test.py|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/master/consistency_test.py]. We should identify which other tests cover this and identify what should be extended, similarly to what has been done with CASSANDRA-15977.

[This document|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BBeGKla9tIPflZ2awkyfl5Hc_FTs3QYw98LWUnb1fTQ/edit?usp=sharing] aims to list and describe the existing functional tests for coordination, so we can have a broad view of what is currently covered.
