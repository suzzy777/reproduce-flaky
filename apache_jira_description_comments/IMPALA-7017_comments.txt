This test was added recently via "IMPALA-6948,IMPALA-6962: add end-to-end tests"

This test has succeeded in other 2.x runs, added flaky label.

IMPALA-7017: deflake/fix test_catalog_restart test

The custom_cluster/test_metadata_replicas.py:test_catalog_restart
test has been recently flaky/broken for two reasons:

1) Variable support for Hive and non-hdfs filesystems. Other tests that
depend on Hive have disabled tests for non-hdfs filesystems. Since the
functionality tested is not intended for all filesystems, this change
disables this test for all filesystems other than hdfs.

2) Several builds have been flaky when looking up catalogd's version.
This change adds a retry for obtaining the version.
