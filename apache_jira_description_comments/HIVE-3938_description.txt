HiveMetaStore::add_partitions() currently adds all partitions specified in one call using a single meta-store transaction. This acts correctly. However, there's one AddPartitionEvent created per partition specified.

Ideally, the set of partitions added atomically can be communicated using a single AddPartitionEvent, such that they are consumed together.

I'll post a patch that does this.
