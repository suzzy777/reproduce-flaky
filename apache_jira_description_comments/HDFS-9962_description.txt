Now that we support multiple EC policies, we need a way test it to catch potential issues.

*UPDATE:*
Since many existing EC unit tests need some changes to use multiple EC policies, it would be good to create a jira for every few tests. Based on some discussion in HDFS-7866 and HDFS-9962, this task follows the below idea.

* Default policy (RS-6-3) always gets tested.
* Create a random ec policy test if the test is long-running (e.g. using minicluster many times).
* If the test is not long, all policies test with parametrizing would be better.

If you are interested in this work, please join it and create a jira under this jira.
