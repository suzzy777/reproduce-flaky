Since we are stopping the view build, we need to [allow the error from doing so|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/commit/1b634d2421847b992af23254cb464d5e7d592c47].  This doesn't repro in 500x [with the patch|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/675/workflows/79ba9d59-8b99-4608-bd1a-f3821d6fd0e5/jobs/7496], but it also doesn't repro [without it|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/674/workflows/75ee1dee-c2fe-4c59-9c0e-7e5c55889ee1/jobs/7494] but we can always reopen later.

+1, I had similar thoughts when opening the ticket but you grabbed it/fixed it very quickly :)Â Thanks!

Ops, which branch you tested with? 4.0? This is where we reproduced. Also, can we try also the other branches in a loop? Sorry missed that with my previous comment. Was too excited to get rid of one more flaky test :D

Yep, those were against 4.0.  I've started [4.1|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/677/workflows/f0f012e1-cebd-462e-b35f-fe3ff94df5dc] and [trunk|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/676/workflows/d0d88d5a-99db-4c49-84fb-ac48ed9f9da2].

Low-energy ping, I think this fell off our radar.

Thanks for the ping, let's rebase and ship it if nothing new pops up? 
+1 on green CI
Apologize I missed the update earlier :(

bq. Apologize I missed the update earlier

No problem, it happens! I forgot all about this too.

Thanks, considering this is a change in the dtest repo, shall we run in a loop the Python test? Unfortunately, the multiplexer does not detect Python DTest changes

I decided not to since the first time we did that, there were no worthwhile results.  It didn't fail in either run.

SGTM, as long as there were no recent changes around that test in the DTest repo it makes sense to me
The runs published also seem ok from the perspective of this patch. We need to check for tickets for the few failures, I do not remember seeing those

On 4.0, the same test timed out on both jvms which is [legit|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-18366].  The 4.1 timeout is environmental and trunk is clean.

Tanks for opening the ticket, I linked it in Butler which shows it consistently started failing on 4.0 with CASSANDRA-18294

Are we ready to commit here?

CI looks good so my +1 stands, thank you! 

Committed.
