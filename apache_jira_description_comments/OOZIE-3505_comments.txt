 # This Zip check accepts if the actual zip has additional files.
 # I think we should use long instead of Long in the crc check.

Starting from Java9, the default locale handling has changed: [https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8206961].
 Gson uses the default US locale when it writes out data: [https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/bind/DateTypeAdapter.java#L96]
 [https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/bind/DateTypeAdapter.java#L61]

With JDK 11
{code:java}
DateFormat.getDateTimeInstance(DateFormat.DEFAULT, DateFormat.DEFAULT, Locale.US)
{code}
will return the following format "MMM d, y, h:mm:ss a" instead of "MMM, d yyyy h:mm:ss a", returned until now in JDK 8.
