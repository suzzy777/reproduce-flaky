This improvement will enhance the functionality of the Ozone build by publishing build scans to [ge.apache.org|https://ge.apache.org/], hosted by the Apache Software Foundation and run in partnership between the ASF and Gradle. This Develocity instance has all features and extensions enabled and is freely available for use by the Apache Ozone project and all other Apache projects.

On this Develocity instance, Apache Ozone will have access not only to all of the published build scans but other aggregate data features such as:
 * Dashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance trends over time
 * Build failure analytics for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures
 * Test failure analytics to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests
