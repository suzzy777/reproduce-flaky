So would TestFaultTolerance failing in this precommit run :) indicate that additional tests need to be disabled ?

Well yes - needs disabling or fixing - there were a bunch of tests failing earlier as the session was getting shutdown. The latest test failure seems something to be addressed as it looks to be a flaky test unless the other previous 5-6 failing tests.
