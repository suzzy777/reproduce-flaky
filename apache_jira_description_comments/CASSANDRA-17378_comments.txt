I ended up only reverting the name change to those three parameters. I want to give a bit of a break to ccm in the moment while we stabilize CI, etc. I will change them later. 

Patch  [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/5bea69f0f6563fc51230b96adbd6066dd1d80315]. CI run [J8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1395/workflows/ca0427b3-da1b-45aa-9eb5-26831ed3cfdc], [J11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1395/workflows/bd556ef1-525c-4635-bf9b-7694ed2888c3]

There are already tickets for all CI issues

[~dcapwell] do you mind to review? 

LGTM.  We talked about https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1335 doing the conversion, if you want you can copy the logic into this patch, else that one will do the conversion.

[~dcapwell], sorry, now I remember, so you won't change the name only the type. CCM change won't be needed. I totally forgot of that change, you absolutely told me about, I remembered only the typo fix before...

I will commit the current patch to fix those two renames and when [CASSANDRA-17166|https://github.com/dcapwell/cassandra/compare/CASSANDRA-17166] lands the new conversion will be added. 

Considering we are still not bumping to 5.0 but only 4.1 I will also cherry-pick [this patch|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/537ad9e17b820e48df78a7edfe6b3a17d56e08bc]. (We committed it only to 4.0 to fix the release issue we had that weekend)

If something changes and we want to bump to 5.0 and really remove all those, we can do that. What do you think? If you agree I will cherry-pick it and run CI again.

I am cool with the patch adding back all configs and leaving type change to CASSANDRA-17166.  Thanks for adding in https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/537ad9e17b820e48df78a7edfe6b3a17d56e08bc, this will let me remove the special case from my diff test.

bq. If something changes and we want to bump to 5.0 and really remove all those, we can do that

when trunk turns into 5.0, then works for me

Great, thanks, while working on the patch I ended up also opening ticket CASSANDRA-17404 to return windows_time_interval in trunk as it was removed without deprecation in CASSANDRA-16956 and we are also still considering trunk to release to 4.1.

Rebased the branch, cherry-picked the agreed commit. Starting CI:

[trunk|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/trunk...ekaterinadimitrova2:17378-trunk?expand=1] - [j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1404/workflows/5bb5412a-87a9-4b5f-94bd-ab0cd618e0b9], [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1404/workflows/e661e69b-bfb6-4059-9c79-f9b4c33f416d]

There are a few failures but nothing related:
 * udf_overload was fixed but the fix is not in the DTest branch I was testing with.
 * Upgrade tests failures are known and we have ticket - CASSANDRA-17140
 * bootstrapTest - seems like flaky test and there is no open ticket. I see this failure with a few patches in CircleCI with Midres today and I found one failure in Butler. I will raise a ticket. Unrelated to this patch.

Starting commit soon
