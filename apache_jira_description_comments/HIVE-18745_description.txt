[~janulatha] fixed the problem, when multiple MetaStore tests are started on the same machine, then they tried to reserve the same port. This caused flakiness in the MetaStore tests run with the ptest framework. See: HIVE-18147

I reviewed the HIVE-17980, and tried to make sure, that the fix remains in every codepath. I was unsuccessful in it. :(

This Jira aims to go through the MetaStore tests, and make sure all of them is using the  {{startMetaStoreWithRetry}} method so the different tests will not cause each other to fail. Also there were clashes not only in port numbers, but warehouse directories as well, so this Jira should fix that also.
