cc [~jieyu] [~lins05] -- any thoughts on whether this is a legitimate issue or a test/environment misconfiguration?

It seems to only affect Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04. Because {{overlay}} isn't enabled there by default, it may be a configuration problem. {{overlay}} was enabled by making sure the module is autoload during boot.

It's probably a configuration issue. After reading some {{overlay}} related docs for Ubuntu it seems that the overlayroot isn't properly configured.

[~nfnt] It's not likely a configuration problem, because there is a test filter that would disable overlay related tests when it detects overlayfs is not supported, that's what would happen when the overlay kernel module is not loaded.

After some googling I found a similar issue [here|https://github.com/coreos/rkt/issues/1537], which is caused by "overlay over overlay". It could happen If the tests is running inside a docker container, and the docker storage driver happens to be overlayfs. 

[~neilc] can you confirm it?


In these configurations the kernel modules is loaded and it's not tested inside a docker container.
I followed the example in http://askubuntu.com/questions/699565/example-overlayfs-usage to confirm that it works. It did with Ubuntu 14.04, not sure about 12.04, will try that again later.

Looks like the version of overlay used in the kernel of Ubuntu 14.04 is rather old. It's 3.13.0. Ubuntu 12.04 is using the same (backported) version. In this version overlay doesn't support {{workdir}} yet.
This small test worked:
{noformat}
cd /tmp
mkdir lower upper overlay
sudo mount -t overlayfs -o lowerdir=/tmp/lower,upperdir=/tmp/upper none /tmp/overlay
{noformat}
This one doesn't:
{noformat}
cd /tmp
mkdir lower upper workdir overlay
sudo mount -t overlayfs -o lowerdir=/tmp/lower,upperdir=/tmp/upper,workdir=/tmp/workdir none /tmp/overlay
{noformat}

[~neilc] May I ask whether this failed every time, or failed sometimes. And what's the overlayfs version, kernel version and Linux distribution of mesosphere ci? I would like to reproduce.

It fails every time. Pretty sure because it an early version of the {{overlayfs}} module. To reproduce, use Ubuntu 14.04. That should have Kernel 3.13. In that version, {{overlayfs}} wasn't yet merged into the kernel, but Ubuntu nevertheless provides an early version of it. You can enable it with a {{sudo modprobe overlayfs}}.

Resolving stale issue. Please re-open if the issue persists.
