Thanks for reporting. I'll look into it.

How slow is Travis? On my machine I could run a 1000 runs in 45 seconds.

I think increasing the timeout and lowering the branching would suffice to fix the flakiness on Travis.

I checked a successful build and the test ran for 1.5 seconds.

It seems a bit odd but I suppose under heavy load and limited resources the test can be stuck for as long as 15 seconds. Will increase the timeout for now.
