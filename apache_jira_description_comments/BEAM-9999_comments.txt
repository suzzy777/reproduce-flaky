Makes sense to me, especially if Beam is moving on in ways that require updates (like Java 11) or if there is maintenance burden. I think the important thing is whether they have users. You can get some general ideas from https://repository.apache.org/#central-stat (committers only access) but it cannot distinguish continuous testing downloads of course.

CC [~mauzhang] for comment on Gearpump

Apache Apex itself has moved to attic and there are no users of the Beam Apex runners that I know of.

 

Same for Gearpump. Thanks for pinging me.

Thank you for the quick comments. Do you think it will be worth bringing this to user or dev list? Or this is sufficient information to remove support. 

One additional benefit would be, some of the ignored tests could also be removed.

IMO this is enough information to remove support and announce the PR in the dev list. For more incentive, the Apex tests are not compatible with Java 11: [BEAM-10089|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10089]
