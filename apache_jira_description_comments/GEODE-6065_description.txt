On some systems, the operating system can have intermittent problems resolving hostnames. Sometimes resolutions work. Other times it fails.

This can result in intermittent failure of {{InetAddress.getByName()}} when it's called in {{InternalDistributedMember(ServerLocation location)}} (constructor). That exception gets re-thrown as a {{GemFireConfigException}}. When that exception is thrown, it ends up stopping processing up in {{GatewaySenderEventRemoteDispatcher.readAcknowledgement()}}.

Event processing should not stop in this case. It should retry so that the system can recover.
