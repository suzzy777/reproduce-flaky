debugging test failures

fixed a text bug, didn't update a test after refactoring to make log messages consistent.  I see there is a flaky test https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dcapwell/cassandra/989/workflows/357ab1b8-a448-44eb-bc94-4881680d4994/jobs/6163/tests#failed-test-0, which I am trying to figure out what's going on (this is an existing test so possible out of scope of this patch; trying to confirm)

fixed test; rerunning CI

Thanks everyone!
