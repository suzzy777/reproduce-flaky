The current Hive 2.0 and 2.1 releases have classes in the org.apache.orc namespace that clash with the ORC project's classes. From Hive 2.2 onward, the classes will only be on ORC, but we'll reduce the problems of classpath issues if we rename the classes to org.apache.hive.orc.

I've looked at a set of projects (pig, spark, oozie, flume, & storm) and can't find any uses of Hive's versions of the org.apache.orc classes, so I believe this is a safe change that will reduce the integration problems down stream.
