I had  a similar issue. With surefire.rerunFailingTestsCount enabled first runs and reruns sometimes ended up in different files And a third party flaky plugin wasn't able to combine them properly.
From what I remember by looking at the code (it was a long time ago), surefire assumed test classes are executed sequentially.
Anyway, to get around this I just ended up a custom JUnit5Xml30StatelessReporter that sorts out test results with a custom StatelessXmlReporter.


[~zoltan.meze] Is it possible to share your custom XML reporter and the steps on how to use it, so that I can also use it?
