These queries were initially identified in HIVE-8017. And it's not supposed to be comprehensive to cover all cases that need the SORT_QUERY_RESULTS label.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12667610

I noted there's an age-1 failure:
{code}
org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.TestOrcHCatLoader.testReadDataPrimitiveTypes
{code}
But I'm not sure if it's related to the patch.

I also have one concern that some qfile contains both cases with and without a guaranteed order. For example in {{limit_pushdown.q}}, we have both:
{{select key,value from src order by key desc limit 20;}}
and
{{select value, sum(key + 1) as sum from src group by value limit 20;}}

If we add {{-- SORT_QUERY_RESULTS}}, the generated results can be different from the expected, e.g. for an {{order by desc}} query.
Do you think this is OK?

+1

The test {{TestOrcHCatLoader.testReadDataPrimitiveTypes}} seems to be quite flaky.

with regards to {{limit_pushdown.q}}, I think the test that is important there is that the limit is pushed down as shown in the explain plan. It's not a correctness test for order by.

Thank you Rui! I have committed this to trunk and merged it to spark!

This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
