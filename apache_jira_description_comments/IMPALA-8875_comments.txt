I looked at the test failures and the issue seems to be that Hive 3 HMS adds 'COLUMN_STATS_ACCURATE': '{}' to the column stats objects during ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN. This can be easily reproduced and I think that it is not flaky. One way to solve this is to ignore COLUMN_STATS_ACCURATE when comparing stats, the other is to add this 'COLUMN_STATS_ACCURATE': '{}' in Impala too.

Assigned this to myself after investigating the cause, as I was afraid that it could cause issues with stats. It turned out to be a very simple test issue.

IMPALA-8875: fix test_drop_column_maintains_stats with Hive 3

Hive 3 adds 'COLUMN_STATS_ACCURATE': '{}' to column statistics
during ALTER TABLE  which lead to breaking this test, as it
expected the stats to be completely equal. Removing this
property before comparision solves the issue.
