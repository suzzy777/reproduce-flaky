The current output of the failed qtests has a less than ideal signal to noise ratio.
We have duplicated stack traces and messages between the error message/stack trace/error out.
For diff errors the actual difference is missing from the error message and can be found only in the standard out.
I would like to simplify this output by removing duplications, moving relevant information to the top.
