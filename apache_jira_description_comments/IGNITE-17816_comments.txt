There are 6 tickets in description to port to ignite-3.
It is almost impossible to figure out quickly what changes in 40+ files relates to what tickets.

Did all of them were ported? How to check this? 

[~amashenkov] , yes, all of them are ported ( one has been removed from the scope). Each of them ported as a separate commit, except few additional commits related to fixing flaky reworked test and fixes related to code style.

I see 5 tickets in description and 8 commits, all of them have same name.

[~jooger], thanks for your contribution, merged to main.
