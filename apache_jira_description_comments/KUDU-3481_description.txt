The {{CatalogManagerConfigurations/MasterStressTest.Test/2}} scenario of {{master-stress-test}} sometimes fails because HMS sends out-of-order log event:
{noformat}
F20230522 20:45:47.163322  1908 hms_notification_log_listener.cc:264] Received out-of-order notification log event (last processed event ID: 22): 22 DROP_TABLE default.table_975e93282e3f4e09833880a7c0dd094a
{noformat}

Apparently, that's not Kudu, but HMS-related issue (probably, [HIVE-19874|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-19874]?).  Anyways, I'm opening this JIRA item to track the flakiness in the test.

The full log is attached.
