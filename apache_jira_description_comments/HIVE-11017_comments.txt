I can repro this on cn041. I'll look for a little bit, but given
{noformat}
// TODO Fix the races and the broken scheduler control in the tests
{noformat}
 comment I might just move it out and disable the test for now

What is this code there? 
{noformat}
while (!isShutdown.get() && !Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
        try {
          while (true) {
{noformat}
while-true has no breaks

LlapSchedulerNodeEnabler cannot run in time, it enables the node too late. I am going to disable the test
