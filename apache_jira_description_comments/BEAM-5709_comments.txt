The test remains to be flaky - I saw at least two flakes today, example: https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Phrase/1056/testReport/org.apache.beam.runners.dataflow.worker.fn/BeamFnControlServiceTest/testClientConnecting/

I did another fix to this and it seems to be working so far (I haven't seen any flakes yet). I'll close this bug in a few days if no one reports any flakes.

My bad, completely forgot to close this.
