[~codope] assigning to you since you made a PR to increase the timeout. will continue to observe it.

There's one more flaky test.
*TestHoodieDeltaStreamer.testAsyncClusteringServiceWithCompaction*

I ran locally 50 times but it never failed. From the CI logs, the reason seems to be incompatible metadata schema due to a rename. At this point, I am not sure how the rename happened. The writer schema which is the current schema is the correct one according to `HoodieMetadataRecord`. For reference I'm attaching the writer and table schemas.

I am going to disable the scehma validation (anyway this is disabled by default, but it is hardcoded to true in `HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter`).

[~xushiyan] [~codope]: can we close this out or do we have any more pending. 

Let's keep it open. I found one failing deltastreamer test in https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/apache-hudi-ci/_build/results?buildId=3101&view=results
That may well be due to the PR. But let's keep it open for a few days. If we don't see any flakiness, then I'll close it.

Sometimes ran into timeout due to being stuck for long time
