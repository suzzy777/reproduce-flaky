GEODE-7742: move existing membership unit/integration tests to geode-membership

Moved all membership integration tests that do not rely on
AvailablePortHelper to the geode-membership sub-project.

There don't appear to be any regular unit tests for membership - all are
integration and dunit tests.  DUnit tests won't be moved to the
membership sub-project.

Remaining integration tests are:
GMSHealthMonitorJUnitTest
GMSJoinLeaveJUnitTest
GMSLocatorIntegrationTest
GMSLocatorRecoveryIntegrationTest
JGroupsMessengerJUnitTest

These need to be moved to geode-membership after required
AvailablePortHelper and SocketCreator functionality has been moved out
of geode-core into a sub-project used by geode-membership.
