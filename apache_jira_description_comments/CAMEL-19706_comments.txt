Hi [~orpiske] , are you suggesting in improving this particular project
[https://github.com/mmelko/vysper-wrapper] with arm support or identifying an alternative approach altogether.

[~jainhitesh9998] hi, that's correct. 

We should investigate doing something similar to what we do for Artemis (building the image on our own): https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/main/test-infra/camel-test-infra-artemis/src/test
