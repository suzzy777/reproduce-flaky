This issue was introduced prior to v1.0.0.

Partially corrected in GEODE-7917 but only for the {{EOFException}} condition.

Changes made for GEODE-1793 introduced the {{IllegalStateException}} but the original {{LocatorCancelException}} is also unchecked an results in similar issues.


Changes for this enhancement resulted in the introduction of the unchecked {{LocatorCancelException}}.

Usage of `IllegalThreadStateException` and `IllegalStateException` added in this enhancement.

As it relates to tests trying to detect locators without SSL enabled connecting to locators with SSL connecting the SSL layer will respond to anything that is not a {{ClientHello}} with an {{Alert}}. The formatting of this {{Alert}} appears to Geode as serialization of the literal type {{Class<Integer>}}, byte value 0x15 (21), followed by unparsed payload bytes. The initial request attempts to then cast {{Class<Integer>}} to {{VersionResponse}}. Perhaps there is a more efficient and accurate way to detect this configuration error.

GEODE-10066: Don't wrap IOExceptions in IllegalStateExceptions. (#7390)

* IOExceptions thrown by the SSL layer will now bubble up to the
  appropriate handlers and cause retries on other locators.

* Refactored for better testing.

* Adds checked exception function utils for wrapping functional lambda methods.

It looks like this test is broken under Windows.

Only appears to be flaky in Java 11 but disabling completely.

GEODE-10066: Fixes testing issues. (#7436)

* Extract inner class LocatorList.
* Make LocatorList iterator that extends Iterator act like Iterator.
* Add tests for LocatorList.

Not back porting to older releases. Fix misconfigured locator or update to Geode 1.15.
