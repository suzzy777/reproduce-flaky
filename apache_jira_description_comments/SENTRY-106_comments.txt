[~brocknoland] do you know if the problem is with the patch or the precommit tests?

Greg, still trying to figure that out...Jenkins seems a little odd in that I cannot view archived files so I am trying to work around that to figure out what the issue is.

[~gchanan] I think it's failing RAT checks due to SecureSentryInfoHandler.java having the package above the license.

I will be submitting a patch to make this more obvious.

Latest patch from review board.  This also gets rid of the SecureSentryInfoHandler file, so if there was a rat check failure, that should go away as well.

Ok that last one was run locally for me with SENTRY-113 applied. That test is flaky so I created SENTRY-114 to address it.

Thank you Gregory! I have committed this to master!
