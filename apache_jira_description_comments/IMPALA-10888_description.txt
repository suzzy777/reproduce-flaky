The CatalogMetastoreServer's implementation of {{getPartitionByNames}} does not return partitions order by partition name whereas in case of HMS it orders them by partition name. While this is not a documented behavior and clients should not assume this it can cause test flakiness where we expect the order of the partitions to be consistent. We should change the implementation so that the returned partitions over this API are sorted by partition name.
