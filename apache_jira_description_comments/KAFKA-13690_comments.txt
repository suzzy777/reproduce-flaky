I took a quick look at https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11283 and I think we overlooked it while adding the test, that for ALOS we should be allowing duplicated records and hence the stores could be double counted.

I'll see if I can find a quick fix for this flakiness.

May cover `shouldCommitCorrectOffsetIfInputTopicIsTransactional`.

Since the linked pull request has been merged, I will close this ticket.
