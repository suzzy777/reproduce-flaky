Had a report from a user that Kerberos+AccumuloStorageHandler+HS2 was broken. Looking into it, it seems like the bit-rot got pretty bad. You'll see something like the following:

{noformat}
Caused by: java.io.IOException: Failed to unwrap AuthenticationToken 
at org.apache.hadoop.hive.accumulo.HiveAccumuloHelper.unwrapAuthenticationToken(HiveAccumuloHelper.java:312) 
at org.apache.hadoop.hive.accumulo.mr.HiveAccumuloTableInputFormat.getSplits(HiveAccumuloTableInputFormat.java:122) 
{noformat}

It appears that some of the code-paths changed since when I first did my testing (or I just did poor testing) and the delegation token was never being fetched/serialized. There also are some issues with fetching the delegation token from Accumulo properly which were addressed in ACCUMULO-4665

I believe it would also be best to just update the dependency to use Accumulo 1.7 (drop 1.6 support) as it's lacking in this regard. These changes would otherwise get much more complicated with reflection -- Accumulo has moved on past 1.6, so let's do the same in Hive.
