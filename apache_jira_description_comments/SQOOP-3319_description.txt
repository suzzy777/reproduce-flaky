Kite Dataset API is used in many places in the code to read/write Parquet files and configure MR jobs.

The goal of this JIRA is to introduce an implementation agnostic interface for Parquet reading/writing and extract the code using Kite Dataset API into separate classes implementing this interface. The benefit of this refactoring is that it enables us introducing a new Parquet reading/writing implementation which does not use Kite but plugs in easily.
