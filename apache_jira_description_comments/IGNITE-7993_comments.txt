    IGNITE-7993 Striped pool can't be disabled

----


[~guseinov], I'm not sure this is enough for the fix. Please create a test and check that system pool is used if you configure to disable striped pool.

[~vkulichenko] , thanks for your comments. I agree with that and will create a test.

[~amashenkov] , could you please review the PR [https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/3661] ?

TC results: [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1149487&tab=queuedBuildOverviewTab] 

Thanks.

Restored the capability to disable striped pool:
 * Added StripedExecutorProxy (wrapped striped executor which delegates all jobs to system executor service).
 * Added StripedExecutorProxyTest

Fix looks good to me.

Just one note, let's add performance opt. suggestion to IgniteKernal.suggestOptimizations(cfg)

[~amashenkov] , thank you. Added performance opt. suggestion.

[~dpavlov] , could you take a look at this PR, please?

TC result: [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1154083&tab=queuedBuildOverviewTab]

I checked the history of the tests which were failed (15 new). It looks like this happens in master branch too...

Thanks.

TC run looks good, javadoc failure seems flaky, so I hope it is ok too. 

[~vozerov], could you please look to fix?

[~yzhdanov], could you please review this change? 

I am afraid I can't estimate impact of this change.

[~guseinov] can you please take a look at my comments in the PR?

 

Thanks!

[~yzhdanov] , thank you for the review. I will provide answers and make changes according to your comments.

    * Renamed StripedExecutor to StripedExecutorImpl

[~amashenkov] , could you please review new PR [https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/3860]

I've implemented the different approach which we discussed before.

TC results: [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1220198&tab=queuedBuildOverviewTab]

Thanks.

[~guseinov]

PR looks ok to me. Can be merged.
Thanks for contribution.

* Renamed StripedExecutor to StripedExecutorImpl
* Added StripedExecutor interface
* Added StripedExecutorProxy (extends IgniteThreadPoolExecutor impl StripedExecutor)
* Added performance optimization suggestion
* Added StripedExecutorProxyTest
* Updated javadoc

[~amashenkov], thank you.

[~dpavlov], I've created a new PR [https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/3860] after got comments from [~yzhdanov] and [~amashenkov]. Could you please review it?

TC results 1: [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1220198&tab=queuedBuildOverviewTab]

TC results 2 (update javadoc + rebase): [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewQueued.html?itemId=1245472&tab=queuedBuildOverviewTab]

It seems newly appeared test failures (PDS (Direct IO) 2, PDS (Indexing), ZooKeeper, etc) aren't related to my changes.

It looks like only flaky tests are failed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Hi [~guseinov], there is several suspicious tests, so I've retriggered these suites.

ZK is defenetely not related to fix.

Hi [~guseinov], I've checked TC, it seems to be more or less the same with master.

Could you please close outdated PR because having 2 open PRs confuses reviewers a lot.

Hi [~yzhdanov], could you please check that your proposals were applied as you have suggested.

Hi [~vkulichenko] ,

Based on Yakov's requirements, I updated fix and created a new PR https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/4235 . Could you please take a look?

TC results: https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1410307&tab=queuedBuildOverviewTab

I've checked 16 new failed tests. Almost all of them were failing on the master branch or on other PRs with the same errors. Just one test was green before my PR test:

IgniteWalFormatFileFailoverTest.testFailureHandlerTriggeredFsync [1]

I checked the log and it looks like this fail is not related to my changes.

Thanks in advance.

[~guseinov], looks like when striped pool is disabled, we simply reuse the system pool for all tasks that are supposed to belong to striped pool. To my knowledge this can lead to thread starvation in some cases. Is it possible to have a separate pool in any case, but just switch form striped to a regular one if striped is disabled?

Hi [~vkulichenko] , thank you for the comments.

According to the conversation with [~yzhdanov] , in this ticket, we just need to restore an ability to disable striped pool. The additional pool can be the next step once we create a reproducer.

[~guseinov], I'm OK with the changes then. Please create the ticket for next step improvements.

[~vkulichenko] , thank you. Sure, I will create a reproducer and rise a new ticket.

Hi [~yzhdanov] , could you please take a look at the PR [https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/4235] 

Thanks in advance.

Please add more tests (see comments in PR)

 

Changes look good at this point

Hi [~yzhdanov] . Thank you for the review. I made the necessary changes and added tests (DisabledStripedExecutorFailoverTest, DisabledStripedExecutorFullApiTest).

TC result: https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=1460792

Please let me know if I need to add more tests.

Thanks.

[~vkulichenko] [~agoncharuk] can you please build the list of minimum required tests to run with disabled striped pool on TC?

[~guseinov] Do we have a chance to resolve this ticket until the code freeze of 2.7?

Hi [~NIzhikov] , if this issue is still relevant I will resolve conflicts. Do you need the fix in 2.7?

Hello, [~guseinov], All I want is to understand the actual state of this ticket.
Do you have a reviewer and committer who is able to look at this ticket and merge it before code freeze?
Is this ticket crucial for 2.7 release?

Moved to 2.8 despite of being in Patch Available state, as we do not see any progress with review over recent time. Also ticket description doesn't seem to indicate any critical problem with the product. Please feel free to move back if you will be able to complete the ticket by AI 2.7 code freeze date, September 30, 2018.

Hi [~ilyak] , could you please review the javadoc updates [https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/5596]? There is going to be implemented a strict thread per partition in the nearest future which will make disabling of striped pool impossible.

Thanks.

[~guseinov] LGTM! Can you please link this ticket to the change that made striped pool mandatory?

[~guseinov] thank you for the contribution!

[~ilyak] , thank you. Here is a link to ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-9270 (Design thread per partition model)

[~guseinov] It's still open. Why one can't disable Striped Pool in current codebase?
