attaching fix to test case. Root causes of failure were

 * materialize command was directly queuing input-check command with zero delay, with no changes in action-actual-time taking effect. Hence actual time was not updated to desired value, instead remaining at 'current time' and giving wrong dependency results
 * explicitly invoked input-check command was failing precondition verification due to earlier command transitioning action to FAILED.
* flakiness was due to timing issues of the direct vs explicit input-check commands

Moving the create test dir actually breaks the purpose of the test case. I believe what you need is just Thread.sleep(2000); after updating actual time.
