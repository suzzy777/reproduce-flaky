Due to the pending 0.8.0 release and reduced scope to dependency upgrades and security fixes as the first release by a renewed community, this issue has been moved to the 0.9.0 release as part of a bulk update. If you feel this is moved out inappropriately, feel free to provide justification and reset the Fix Version to 0.8.0.
