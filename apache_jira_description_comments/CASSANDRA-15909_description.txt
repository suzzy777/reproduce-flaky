As part of CASSANDRA-15821 it became apparent that certain metric names found in keyspace and tables had different names but were in fact the same metric - they are as follows:

* Table.SyncTime == Keyspace.RepairSyncTime
* Table.RepairedDataTrackingOverreadRows == Keyspace.RepairedOverreadRows
* Table.RepairedDataTrackingOverreadTime == Keyspace.RepairedOverreadTime
* Table.AllMemtablesHeapSize == Keyspace.AllMemtablesOnHeapDataSize
* Table.AllMemtablesOffHeapSize == Keyspace.AllMemtablesOffHeapDataSize
* Table.MemtableOnHeapSize == Keyspace.MemtableOnHeapDataSize
* Table.MemtableOffHeapSize == Keyspace.MemtableOffHeapDataSize

Also, client metrics are the only metrics to start with a lower case letter. Change those to upper case to match all the other metrics.

Unifying this naming would help make metrics more consistent as part of CASSANDRA-15582
