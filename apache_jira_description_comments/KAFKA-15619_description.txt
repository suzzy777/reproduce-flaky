Deleted topics will come back again in Apache Spark structured streaming stress test after upgrade Kafka from 3.4.0 to 3.5.0, related ticket is: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45529 , the test randomly starts/stops/adds data/add partitions/delete topic/add topic/checks the result in a loop, I finally found that a deleted topic will come back again after some time.

By constantly reseting the head of branch-3.5 and using {{gradlew install}} to repackage and rerunning of the stress test, I have basically inferred that this bug comes from [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12590]
