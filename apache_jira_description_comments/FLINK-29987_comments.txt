As far I understand the flakiness is caused by unconditional {{Thread.sleep}} statement followed by assertion in the test. If the condition does not become true during the fixed sleep period, the assertion fails. I would like to convert this code to something like {{await().atMost(5, SECONDS).until(() -> assert(...));}}

To implement that we can use [https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility] as a test dependency. What do you think?

[~Gerrrr] Sounds nice~

Thanks! I'll make a PR in the next couple of days. Can you please assign the issue to me (or give permission to do that myself)?
