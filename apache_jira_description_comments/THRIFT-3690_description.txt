As each of 24 jobs build downloads or builds a docker image, one or two of them has been constantly failing.
It should be alleviated by introducing retry and also disabling the 10 min auto failure.

Also, according to the doc, travis-ci env has 2 cores.

So I'm changing make -j4 -> -j3 for now to see if it reduces some test flakiness for free.
