From Java SE 8 onwards, users are asked to migrate to from [joda time|https://www.joda.org/joda-time/] to java.time (JSR-310).

It seems to me, that we only use it directly in one place: [TestWorkflowActionRetryInfoXCommand.java|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/apache/oozie/command/wf/TestWorkflowActionRetryInfoXCommand.java] so it would be not too difficult to migrate.
