Camera plugin Appium tests are very flaky because of some weird Android emulator behavior. The most common error is happening at random stages of image capture. The error callback gets called with the message "Camera cancelled".

To avoid these flaky failures, each spec should be retried up to three times. If the failure persists, then and only then it should fail.
