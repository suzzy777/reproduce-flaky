[~DmitriyGovorukhin], Hi.

Could you take a look at the test fix, please? Seems you merged it in the IGNITE-8575 issue.

I have checked it [500 times|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_BasicTestsWithPersistence&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F7001%2Fhead&fromExperimentalUI=true&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv] on TC.

[~alex_pl], could you take a look, please? It seems that Dmitriy cannot take a look.

[~NSAmelchev]Â looks good to me, merged to master.

Thanks for your contribution!
