FYI [~hsheinblatt_impala_e511]

Please consider guaranteed behavior vs. current behavior.  We want to code tests based on the features guaranteed by the framework, not based on current implementation details, so that if we upgrade the test framework the tests will still work.  If the way a feature works (e.g. which tests get new instances) is not guaranteed by the framework, we want to code the tests to be independent of it regardless of how it currently is implemented.
