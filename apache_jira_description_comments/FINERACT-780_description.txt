Our org.apache.fineract.integrationtests.HookIntegrationTest seems to be "flaky" and occassionally arbitrary fails.

This seems to have happened e.g. in https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/557 as well as again in https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/607.

I suspect it's related to this in the code of that test:

{code:java}
// Subject to https://echo-webhook.herokuapp.com being up
// See
// http://www.jamesward.com/2014/06/11/testing-webhooks-was-a-pain-so-i-fixed-the-glitch
final String payloadURL = "http://echo-webhook.herokuapp.com:80/Z7RXoCBdLSFMDrpn?";
this.hookHelper.createHook(payloadURL);
{code}

In an ideal world, even an integration test should not depend on an external service running on some arbitrary 3rd party website.

What someone probably could do is to instead start some sort of Echo Server written in Java in-process as part of that test. Something like this may already exist as a library somewhere, or otherwise it probably wouldn't be terribly hard to write it.

If this happens more often, perhaps just temporarily adding an {{@Igore}} for this test would be in order (until someone can do above).
