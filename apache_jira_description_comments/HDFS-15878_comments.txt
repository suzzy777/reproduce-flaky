I think this will be fixed by [HDFS-15423|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-15423]

Thanks [~fengnanli] for update. We can close the issue then.

Let's wait after HDFS-15423 is committed. Thanks.

[~inigoiri] How can we verify the tests are fixed? Is there some jenkins job I can monitor on?

[~weichiu] can you help verify the tests have been successful? thanks!

The failure didn't show up in this page: [https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/hadoop-qbt-trunk-java8-linux-x86_64/490/testReport/]

[~weichiu] [~aajisaka] [~ayushtkn] [~hexiaoqiao]  Since there is the effort going on cleaning up the tests. Can you guys help to confim?

Thanks a lot!

[~fengnanli] Just run a couple of times locally as well, If it doesn't fail and you can't see it in the build reports as well. You can resolve this as {{Not A Problem}} and if this surfaces again later it can be reopened again

Thanks [~ayushtkn] for the answer. I was thinking you guys have some automated tools to monitor the failure rate of certain tests.

The goal was trying to prove that HDFS-15423 fixed it since some changes were made in that patch to make RouterWebHDFSContract fixture have separate Datanodes among downstream HDFS clusters thus the flakiness of this test is avoided.

I have run this test locally many times and couldn't reproduce the failure so will resolve it.

Hi [~fengnanli], Just found that this issue is marked as `resolved` but without fix version and no attach patches or PR link. Is it more proper to mark as `Not A Problem`? Thanks.

Reopen to change the closing status.

[~hexiaoqiao] [~ayushtkn]  Updated the status as suggested. Thanks.

This test still fails.

The latest qbt log: https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/hadoop-qbt-trunk-java8-linux-x86_64/597/artifact/out/patch-unit-hadoop-hdfs-project_hadoop-hdfs-rbf.txt

WebHDFS does not support hflush to make files visible immediately, I think the FileNotFoundException due to create-visibility-delayed should be tolerated. [~aajisaka] I've created a pull request to resolve this issue, could you take a look at it, thanks.

Committed to trunk.

Thanx Everyone!!!
