[~vinod@twitter.com] If this test is flaky on the same platform, please confirm. I would not normally ask this, as the ticket title already suggests it is. But I am not yet able to reproduce the problem and the source code looks OK so far.

Is it possible that the behavior occurs every time on your platform? If so, could you give me details so I can reproduce this? If this is the case, one remote possibility is that an older version of tar takes an extra "z" argument for unpacking archives and we don't provide it, because "man tar" as long as I can remember says we don't need to.


[~vinod@twitter.com] I found "mesos-fedora-20-gcc" in the log above. This would strongly hint at a rather new Linux version. This seems to strongly hint at general flakiness of the test. Right?


This happened on a stock fedora 20 VM Jenkins slave. So far it only failed once on this box. So I would be surprised if it's a tar version issue. 

[~vinod@twitter.com] Thanks! Good to know for sure. No need to play around with the tar command then. Now on to more trying to reproduce this...


Is this really "in progress"? last comment/update almost three months ago - I'm 'stopping' it, but keeping in Sprint's scope.

Also, it would be good to confirm whether it was just a once-failure, is it repeatable, or is it a 'flaky' test?

It is a failure that only appeared once so far. I still have not found what causes it. Will take another look soon.

This appears to have the identical cause as MESOS-3579: {{mesos-fetcher}} can sometimes fail to unpack a compressed tar archive since {{tar}} fails to recognize it as actually compressed. We implemented a work-around for this test there as well.
