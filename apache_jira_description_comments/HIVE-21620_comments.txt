Sorry to interrupt, can I ask who to talk to regarding this fix? 
Thanks! [~mmccline], [~dlavati], [~wzheng]

Hi [~dac], 
thank you for your investigation, you can find more info on the process here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute

I'm not yet familiar with this part of the code base, but I can give some further notes on contributing:
 * We have a green run policy for new commits, which means you need to submit your patch in this Jira and an automation will check your code. The patch has to bee iterated until all tests pass in the precommit job. (Note here, that some tests tend to be flaky, so multiple resubmits of the same patch is possible, if the failed tests are unrelated.) See [Creating a patch|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute#HowToContribute-CreatingaPatch] and [Contributing your work|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute#HowToContribute-ContributingYourWork]
 * Is this resolved in the current Hive version? If this is unique to Hive 2.x only, you'll need to submit your patch here for *branch-2*
 * Can you recreate the issue with a few SQL commands from scratch? Adding a unit test for previously bad behaviour is advised. You can find more info at [Query Unit Test|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute#HowToContribute-QueryUnitTest]
