Perhaps the specified problem has already been resolved by the patch proposed in IGNITE-14794, it is worth checking it before starting the investigation. 

The test hangs when the restore process is initiated from node 1, whose communication is later blocked (and cannot be unblocked).
The test flaky fails due to a state sync issue. We are canceling the process on two nodes, but only waiting on the initiator to complete (this has been fixed in IGNITE-14794).

It looks like the patch proposed in IGNITE-14794 fixes this completely. Checked it on TeamCity (the problem is hardly reproducible locally), [suite started 80+ times|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_ControlUtilityZookeeper&tab=buildTypeHistoryList&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F9186%2Fhead]:
* Execution timeouts (not related to this issue) - 2 times.
* testBaselineCollectCrd - 6 failures.
* testBaselineCollect - 1 failure.
* testSnapshotRestoreCancelAndStatus - *0* failures.

Update.

Firstly, IGNITE-14794 is no longer relevant to this ticket because the status command has been redesigned in IGNITE-13510 and that part has been completely removed from IGNITE-14794.

Secondly, I found another reason for the suite to hang. It's because the condition before communication unblocking may fail and communication leaves blocked.
So I decided to rework this test and get rid of communication blocking.

Checked zk suite 60 times.

No hunging and failures of this test.
I found 1 execution timeout, but that's because tests sometimes don't fit in 30 minutes suite timeout (all tests passed).
