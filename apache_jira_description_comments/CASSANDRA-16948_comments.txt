That is only part of that ... yes, this is an issue as well. Especially when you are running locally, so you do not have enough disk space available and it emits these warnings and test expects something else.

 

But if you get through this, the error itself is in StandaloneVerifier (or so), it just logs the exception / errors differently from version to version I think and it seems to be flaky in general. Line 303 I think.

[~dcapwell] this second part of this as I wrote above is more interesting.

#justfyi there is some history to this guy see CASSANDRA-12519 ie. Reading about it might help as it has been historically speaking always flaky-ish

Linked branch fixes the test on 3.11.  I didn't run into any other problems you mentioned Stefan, but I noticed this was using a 3 node cluster and rf=3 for no reason, so I dropped it to a single node which may assuage your issues.

test_sstableverify - offline_tools_test.TestOfflineTools failure here [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/instaclustr/cassandra/461/workflows/c81c0b93-640a-4046-89c2-7eae17535513/jobs/2238/tests#failed-test-2]

Hmm, well that's a problem in the 4.0 code.  I'll take a look though.

I think I was messing with that test in order to fix what I saw and that build does not necessarily repeats the exact behavior rather my attempt to fix it. Basically, the regexp on the line 303 fails:

assert re.search("Corrupted: " + sstable1, error) - this does not match anything. Try to run it in a loop against 3.11 / 4.0.0.

bq.  that build does not necessarily repeats the exact behavior

Indeed, since the test randomizes the spot where it corrupts the table, sometimes 4.0 throws a slightly different error about the sstable being invalid.  I thought the 4.0 test was ok so I left it alone, but I've updated my branch to use my approach for all versions.

Added a little fix to make sure the path comparisons work on MacOS: [https://github.com/maedhroz/cassandra-dtest/commits/CASSANDRA-16948-macos]

otherwise, LGTM

Committed with your mac fix added, thanks!
