Dupe of CASSANDRA-17932?

Possibly!

[~mck] can you please do a preliminary quick sanity check see if sthg like [this|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/view/all/job/Cassandra-5.0-repeat/2/] looks good/makes sense? I still have to fix the j17 bug and see how I can go about keeping logs which at the moment get lost in docker and I don't know where I should store them yet...

make sense, right direction! 

Recap so far:

- 2 new scripts run-tests-enhanced.sh are added. These add repeat functionality and work with getopts format params
- A new [jenkins job|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-5.0-repeat/] can already be used to fire repeated test runs
- The original run-tests.sh scripts are kept but they just call the new ones. This allows to A. Not having to modify the current Jenkins DSL and avoiding a big-bang 'release' of the ticket B. Easy revert of the ticket if needed C. Compatibility with any other CI integrations or implementations using the original scripts
- All java repeats should work and results are SSH'ed to nightlies. A cron job will be requested for periodic cleanup of that folder.
- Python dtests are not working yet
- All Jenkins DSL wotk such as adding the new jenkins job or renaming of scripts can happen in a later ticket to not de-stabilize CI once this ticket is merged and seen stable.

When I do this

{code}
 .build/run-tests-enhanced.sh -a jvm-dtest-repeat -e REPEATED_TESTS_COUNT=100 -e REPEATED_TESTS=org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.ClearSnapshotTest
{code}

When I change my mind after 10th test and I do "ctrl+c", I have to do that 90 times. That is because "ctrl+c" will cancel just the very test it just runs but it continues in the loop. Can not we somehow break the loop?

Also, how can I run just one method? I tried this:

{code}
-e REPEATED_TESTS=org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.ClearSnapshotTest.clearSnapshotSlowTest
'-e REPEATED_TESTS=org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.ClearSnapshotTest.clearSnapshotSlowTest'
-e REPEATED_TESTS=org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.ClearSnapshotTest#clearSnapshotSlowTest
'-e REPEATED_TESTS=org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.ClearSnapshotTest#clearSnapshotSlowTest'
{code}

none of them seems to work or maybe I just messed it up?

Ctrl+C is sthg I didn't catch. Test method level is TODO as pointed [here|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/2826/files#diff-6ecc9a6fcc1fc20e17804279e7d3930b91bf007edaaf40066fd312c3ef2c2255R231] still

I have got to having java CI repeats working. I am attaching  [^testJava.txt],  [^testJavaDocker.txt] and  [^testJavaSplits.txt] outputs as local CI proof the code works for java targets, splits and the same under Docker. I am also adding this https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-5.0-repeat/9/ as proof that repeats work on Jenkins.  [^jenkins_job.xml] is the file containing the definition for that jenkins job.

So far dev here stops after discussing with [~mck] to avoid touching CI when nearing a release. Also CASSANDRA-18594 might land soon and have an impact. This will be revisited post 5.0.
