It looks like the wait in testTokenThreadTimeout times out for 30 seconds.
I don't think this is just an issue timing out but the test just not being deterministic.
[~manirajv06@gmail.com] any idea?

[~inigoiri]

I was not able to reproduce on my machine even after multiple runs. However, as a first step, I fixed the ArithmeticException as mentioned in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-9768?focusedCommentId=17022152&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17022152

assuming that this would avoid huge amount of unnecessary I/O into logs and also to get us into cleaner situation wherein we can focus on the actual problem. Also, reduced the timeout values to avoid waiting unnecessarily.

Please take a look.

Actually, the stack trace in:
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/25549/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.security/TestDelegationTokenRenewer/testTokenThreadTimeout/
Shows all the time:
{code}
Caused by: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
	at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.event.AsyncDispatcher$GenericEventHandler.handle(AsyncDispatcher.java:295)
	at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.security.DelegationTokenRenewer$DelegationTokenRenewerRunnable.handleDTRenewerAppSubmitEvent(DelegationTokenRenewer.java:1072)
	at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.security.DelegationTokenRenewer$DelegationTokenRenewerRunnable.run(DelegationTokenRenewer.java:1039)
{code}

That might be it.
[~adam.antal], you said you could repro, can you check with [^YARN-10155.001.patch]?

Uploaded test logs (run by IntelliJ with Repeat: Until failure configuration)
- before the patch (current trunk):  [^testTokenThreadTimeout.txt] 
- with the patch applied (the failure happened for the 4th run):  [^testTokenThreadTimeout_with_patch.txt] 

I don't see any ArithmeticException in the logs. 
If you don't succeed in reproducing it, then maybe it is some setup issue on my local computer/IntelliJ configs, so I'll attempt a git clean+maven clean build to wipe out everything and try again.


[~adam.antal] Thanks for your effort. I've been running all my tests through mvn cli with prior clean and build. Can you please try the alternative step?

I could not reproduce the test failure from mvn CLI.

I saw the test failure multiple times in the mentioned Jenkins results, but that could have been some flaky issue.

Let's keep this jira open for a few days, and if the issue does not reoccur, let's close this.

Thanks for checking this [~manirajv06@gmail.com] and [~inigoiri].

Ok. However, we can get this patch in as it fixes the exception and reduces the waiting time. Post that, we can see the behaviour in Jenkins for some time and then close the Jira based on the results. Thoughts?

I agree on that. Thanks! 

Let's go with [^YARN-10155.001.patch].
+1 on  [^YARN-10155.001.patch].
Let's keep an eye once merged.

Thanks [~adam.antal] for bringing this up and checking.
Thanks [~manirajv06@gmail.com] for the fix.
Committed to trunk.
