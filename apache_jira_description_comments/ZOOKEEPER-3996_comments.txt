Not find a bug in the test, maybe just a timeout when the CI machine is a contention state.

The potential improvement may be: increase the value of timeout？

 
{code:java}
@Timeout(value = 90) ---> 120 s
watcher.waitForReadOnlyConnected(5000); ---> 10000/15000ms
{code}
 

New failure runs, they failed at same assertions.
