The InteractiveRunner crashes when given a pipeline that includes a cross-language transform.

Here's the example I tried to run in a jupyter notebook:
{code:python}
p = beam.Pipeline(InteractiveRunner())
pc = (p | SqlTransform("""SELECT
            CAST(1 AS INT) AS `id`,
            CAST('foo' AS VARCHAR) AS `str`,
            CAST(3.14  AS DOUBLE) AS `flt`"""))
df = interactive_beam.collect(pc)
{code}

The problem occurs when [pipeline_fragment.py|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/dce1eb83b8d5137c56ac58568820c24bd8fda526/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/interactive/pipeline_fragment.py#L66] creates a copy of the pipeline by [writing it to proto and reading it back|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/dce1eb83b8d5137c56ac58568820c24bd8fda526/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/interactive/pipeline_fragment.py#L120]. Reading it back fails because some of the pipeline is not written in Python.
