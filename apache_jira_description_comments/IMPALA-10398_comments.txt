IMPALA-10398: Altering an Iceberg table might throw NullPointerException

IcebergSchemaConverter has a static thread local member which might
not have a value in the current thread when nextId() is invoked. In
that case the thread local integer's get() method returns a null and
we get a NullPointerException when we want to convert it to a builtin
int.

This patch initializes the thread local variable with an anonymous
subclass of ThreadLocal that overrides the 'initialValue()' method
which returns 0 instead of null.

Testing
 * tested manually by restarting the impala cluster and issuing
   ALTER TABLE .. ADD COLUMNS <columns with complex types>
 * looped test_alter_iceberg_tables for a while
