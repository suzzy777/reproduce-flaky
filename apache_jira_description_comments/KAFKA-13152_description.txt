The current config "buffered.records.per.partition" controls how many records in maximum to bookkeep, and hence it is exceed we would pause fetching from this partition. However this config has two issues:

* It's a per-partition config, so the total memory consumed is dependent on the dynamic number of partitions assigned.
* Record size could vary from case to case.

And hence it's hard to bound the memory usage for this buffering. We should consider deprecating that config with a global, e.g. "input.buffer.max.bytes" which controls how much bytes in total is allowed to be buffered. This is doable since we buffer the raw records in <byte[], byte[]>.
