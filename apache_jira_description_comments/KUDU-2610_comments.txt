Hm that's funny as I doubled the timeout recently when this flakiness showed itself in a precommit, then ran the test many times through dist-test and saw no problem. Probably, I should reduce the frequency of leader changes in ASAN, or even disable the test.

I ran 2000 tests in ASAN mode, 1000 with 8 stress cpu threads, and 1000 with 16 stress cpu threads, and did not see any failures...if we keep seeing this I'll look into it more but maybe this is more the fault of the environment than the test?

[test] KUDU-2610 fix flakiness in kudu-admin-test scenario

I saw AdminCliTest.TestSimultaneousLeaderTransferAndAbruptStepdown
failing with timed-out error trying to write data to the test table:

  http://dist-test.cloudera.org/job?job_id=aserbin.1575418627.126650

A log from another occurrence of this issue is attached to
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2610

It seems the frequency of the leader change/step-down requests might be
safely decreased to make this test more stable.  The test already have
the frequency of the leader change requests clamped down for ASAN
builds compared with the RELEASE/DEBUG/TSAN case.
