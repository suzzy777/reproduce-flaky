*Phenomenon* 

Currently, {{SSH Action}} checking operation are as following: 

Firstly, check operation is to check {{Oozie}} ppid. When pgid does not exist, check whether there is an error file. If the error file does not exist, {{Oozie}} will set action status {{OK}}

However, when {{Oozie}} pgid is killed externally, this action will be incorrectly determined to be successful.

*Solution*

In ssh-wrapper.sh, when command execution is OK, {{Oozie}} should touch a success empty file like touching error file.
In {{SshActionExecutor}} check method, Oozie should add checking the success file existence.
