CASSANDRA-18025 only touched stress which I don't see this test importing, so it seems an unlikely candidate to me.

We did some archaeology here and discovered that this test has been flaky since j17 was added, so it is likely just pushing jenkins over the top sometimes.

I think we should close for now and we can reopen if we see this again in a more stable environment.

Agree! I ran the test using the commit[ a2dc44f072|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/a2dc44f0725b02294071e67d0cab57a7629f25a1] to reproduce the error, but there is no error message related to it. 

I agree; I'm closing for now. It was also not seen recently in CI. We can always revisit the decision if it pops up again. 
Thank you both for looking into it!
