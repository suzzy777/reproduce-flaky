Sometimes the issues have been reported where the solution was to increase the wait time and this is a bit alarming as intuitively I would expect Falcon Unit tests to be faster.  Can you please add the time taken before and after the change? Sometimes these changes might not be visible for one small tests, so you might need to run them several times to compare them. 

[~pallavi.rao] and [~pavan kumar], addressed your review comments.

Can you please share the performance numbers as well?

[~ajayydv], The processInstanceManagerIT was disabled initially, and the testcase fails even when I ran, so we cannot compare this. I will add the time differences once I migrate other integration tests.
Even while the wait time here of the sleep job is 30 or 40 seconds, still this will not affect the time taken by the tests as I dont wait for the process to succeed every time. This time is just to ensure that the instances remain in the running state so that we can check the suspended and such functionality.

Addressed the minor checkstyle issues.

Thanks [~nperiwal]. Can you please share the current execution time? I just want to ensure that it is fast as expected.

[~ajayydv], Current execution time of ProcessInstanceManager is around 55 seconds.

[~pallavi.rao], addressed the review comments

+1. Will commit if no further review comments.

[~nperiwal], I tried applying the latest patch attached and I saw lot of IT failures. 
{code}
Failed tests: 
  EntityManagerJerseyIT.testDuplicateDeleteCommands:622->testDuplicateCommandsResponse:629 expected:<400> but was:<200>
  EntityManagerJerseyIT.testLibExtensions:124->assertLibs:97 » FileNotFound File...
  ProcessInstanceManagerIT.testGetInstanceStatus:112 » NullPointer
  ProcessInstanceManagerIT.testGetInstanceStatusPagination:127 » NullPointer
  ProcessInstanceManagerIT.testKillInstances:143 » NullPointer
  ProcessInstanceManagerIT.testReRunInstances:170 » NullPointer
  ProcessInstanceManagerIT.testResumesInstances:220 » NullPointer
  ProcessInstanceManagerIT.testSuspendInstances:200 » NullPointer
{code}

Is the patch latest?

[~pallavi.rao], I looked at the patch and found it was not the latest. I am updating the latest patch. I tested that the tests for ProcessInstanceManagerIT are passing now but some of the tests in EntityManagerjerseyIT that are flaky, still fails.


[~nperiwal], I still see a failed test which I think is related to your patch:
{code}
testLibExtensions(org.apache.falcon.resource.EntityManagerJerseyIT)  Time elapsed: 0.68 sec  <<< FAILURE!

[~pallavi.rao], The issue which caused the test to fail is resolved and i have updated the patch. Thanks for the help.

Builds fine. Will commit in a bit.

To https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/falcon.git
   2d5516e..db0604d  master -> master

Thanks [~nperiwal] for opening up previously disabled tests.

Thanks [~pallavi.rao]
