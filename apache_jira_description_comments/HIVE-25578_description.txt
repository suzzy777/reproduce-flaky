The following qtests are failing consistently ([example|http://ci.hive.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/hive-precommit/detail/PR-2667/6/tests/]) on the master branch:
 * TestMiniLlapCliDriver ([http://ci.hive.apache.org/job/hive-flaky-check/420/])
 ** newline
 ** groupby_bigdata
 ** input20
 ** input33
 ** rcfile_bigdata
 ** remote_script
 * TestContribCliDriver ([http://ci.hive.apache.org/job/hive-flaky-check/421/])
 ** serde_typedbytes5

The failure reason for all seems to be that operators can't be closed. Not 100% sure that TestContribCliDriver#serde_typedbytes5 failure is related to the others â€“ the issue seems to be the same, the error message is a bit different.

I'm about to disable these as they are blocking all work.
