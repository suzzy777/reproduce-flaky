Addressed in https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4996

Thanks for the amendment! I am really not fond of burnt in waiting times in test, but as the real persisting happens independently, I could not rely on a hook-point. An other refinement we might do is to add "intelligent" waiting, which after an initial waiting time, tries to poll a number of times. [https://www.baeldung.com/awaitlity-testing]Â This would ensure that in normal conditions the test would not run for long but also would prevent it from being flaky. What do you think?

sorry Simon i didnt' catch this comment until now.  I should have avoided lumping these two JIRAs in the same PR for this very reason.

My changing of that line was because the conversion thing didnt offer any value.  It was an indirect way of getting an explicit value so I just set a lower explicit value.  We'll have to keep an eye on it.
