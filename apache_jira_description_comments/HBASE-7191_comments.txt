Actually, this affects other versions as well
{code}
HBase 0.94.1
{code}
Further more; FSUtils spits out a misleading message
{code}
 String msg = "File system needs to be upgraded."
      + "  You have version " + version
      + " and I want version " + HConstants.FILE_SYSTEM_VERSION
      + ".  Run the '${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase migrate' script.";
{code}
As far as I can tell 'migrate' script is no longer available

One would think 'hbase hbck -fixVersionFile' would do the trick, but that requires a running instance of HBase which we can't start unless those two files are in tact 

The current workaround is to temporarily change the value of 'hbase.rootdir' -> start/stop hbase (this will re-create the two files) -> copy those files to the original 'hbase.rootdir' and change 'hbase.rootdir' to point back to the original one. However, this is obviously a hack. May what really needs to happen is to have and offline option of 'hbase hbck -fixVersionFile'.


We can add -fixVersionFile to the offline meta repair tool.

Attaching a patch which basically adds two options to OfflineMetaRepair
{code}
$ hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.hbck.OfflineMetaRepair -fixVersionFile

$ hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.hbck.OfflineMetaRepair -fixClusterIdFile
{code}

Also fixed a few other minor things such as System.exit(..) which prevented proper testing and quite frankly not needed as access to the executor can still be obtain via Reflection.

Not sure what I can do. The test does pass but there are other failing tests:
{code}
Failed tests:   testSplitCalculatorEq(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.TestRegionSplitCalculator): expected:<2> but was:<1>
  testNativeSizes(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.TestHeapSize): expected:<56> but was:<64>
  testSizes(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.TestHeapSize): expected:<192> but was:<200>
{code}

 and looking at the Jenkins report there hasn't been a successful build since October 30 (as far as I can see).

The irony is that for example TestRegionSplitCalculator test passes locally if ran in isolation 

Haven't looked at the patch in detail but some things that you should take care of: 
(1) indentation of code (two spaces, look at the existing code for getting a feel of how it should look like).
(2) patch should be submitted for trunk first (ideally)
There are flaky tests in the codebase. If you see an unrelated test failing on hudson, and the test passes locally, please make a note of it as a comment on jira.

For OfflineVersionAndClusterIdFixTests.java, usually test class starts with Test. Name it TestOfflineVersionAndClusterIdFix
It should carry the following annotation:
{code}
@Category(SmallTests.class)
{code}
{code}
-      System.exit(success ? 0 : 1);
+     shutDownFsck(fsck);
{code}
Can you log the value of success above ?
For shutDownFsck(), can you add a method in HBaseFsck which shuts down executor ?

Thanks Deveraj
The 3 failing tests are mentioned in the previous comment. Actually they pass in isolation, but not as a full build (unrelated to the patch). I'll check the indentation and resubmit. Let me know if there is anything else you'll see in the meantime. I'll also do another one anyway from the trunk


[~yuzhihong@gmail.com]
Sure, will do

@Oleg:
w.r.t. the test failures in TestHeapSize, did you run the tests using Java 1.7 ?
I encountered the same failure on MacBook with 1.7.0_07-b10

That might be the case. I'll check in the AM. The funny thing is that they all pass in IDE and/or if ran in isolation via maven, but not with other tests. But you may be right, i may have 1.7 as a default. 

Cancelling stale patch. I guess this issue can be closed?

anybody here?  

I encounter this issue.

 
hbase hbck can not repair offline hdfs problem.

hbase failed to start because there is no version file on hdfs. try to do "hbase hbck -fixVersionFile"，but the tool will connect master, so failed.

anyone can help me？ thank you。
 

Can we move the connect() method to the position after offlineHdfsIntegrityRepair() method?

 

Sounds good [~johou]. Does it work?

ok,I will try to do it :)

hi,
I made a patch for hbck1 base on 1.4 branch.
where is the upload button :(

[~johou] I added you to the contributors role for the project, you should now have access to the More -> Attach Files function. Please try again.

please help me to review the patch,thanks.
the patch created base on 1.4 branch. 


Do we maintain the branch-1.* ？
in fact, I am writing the  handbook  of maintenance  for the maintenance team。
The hbck tool is very important so I dig it 。but........
also found others problem. for example: 
1. create the new table with some empty regions.
2. delete the .regioninfo file in  one region folder(I want to make the INCONSISTENT and to fix it)
3. hbase hbck -fixHdfsOrphans 

result：the region folder will be sidelined because no data。


[~johou] Another heuristic in hbck1 prevails, the one that considers empty dirs as corrupt or remainders from incomplete-deletes?

You are trying to teach hbck1 to create the version and id files? The version should be easy enough. You could create one offline and copy it into place. On the id, I don't recall -- does it have to be just unique so any id will do or does it have to be the id that was there previous?

[~stack]

>> You could create one offline and copy it into place.
yes , it works. 
>>On the id, I don't recall....
I also did not test it.

ok :)  thank you for your reply.

Back looking at this issue. This is what I get if I remove the hbase.version file:

{code}
 org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.FileSystemVersionException: HBase file layout needs to be upgraded. You have version null and I want version 8. Consult http://hbase.apache.org/book.html for further information about upgrading HBase. Is your hbase.rootdir valid? If so, you may need to run 'hbase hbck -fixVersionFile'.

   at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster.lambda$run$0(HMaster.java:577)
   at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:844)
{code}

After commit of HBASE-22688 this morning, the fix is running the filesystem command from hbck2 with the -fix option. It restores the hbase.version file.

{code}$ HBASE_CLASSPATH_PREFIX=../hbase-operator-tools/hbase-hbck2/target/hbase-hbck2-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar bin/hbase org.apache.hbase.HBCK2 filesystem -fix{code}

It does NOT put back the hbase.id file. Launching the hbase process creates a new one if missing which is probably not ideal; should probably try and find old cluster id and put that back rather than create a new one. hbase cluster id doesn't seem critical so will leave it for now until someone complains.

Meantime let me close out this issue with a patch that fixes the message that is spewed when hbase.version is missing.


Small patch that outputs one message if hbase.version is missing and another if version is old. Points to hbck2 rather than hbck1 for fixing missing hbase.version.
