[~ndimiduk] yeah, the failures are related. this is a rabbit hole. i'm working on a patch, it is not that simple as I thought since there are various places where assignment is not sync.
also TestCreateTableProcedure will not be fixed with this because we don't have an event post region initialization. the open is only "new HRegion" and not region.initialize()

I think v2 as a good compromise between not changing too much code and having a "good enough for now" fix.
(what I said above was not correct, the initialize() call is the openRegion(), so TestCreateTableProcedure will be fixed by this)
