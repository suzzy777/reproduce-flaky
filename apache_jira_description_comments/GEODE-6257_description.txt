Moving to Visual Studio 2017 appears to reveal this test to be FLAKY. Although the Debug build passes in the CI (although takes several retries), the Release build isn't passing using the default retries. Also, this test only fails in the CI. I have been unable to make it fail locally on the new iMac Pro.

For now this test has been marked as FLAKY to allow for a green CI in the VS 2017 build. It should be moved to the new framework to debug it.
