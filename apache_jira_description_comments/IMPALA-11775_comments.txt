The test add a new column "b" to Kudu table, and verify that changes in Kudu schema should be immediately visible to Impala with Catalog V2.  But the test failure show that Impala returned an error "Invalid argument: Some columns are not present in the current schema: b", which indicates the schema change was NOT immediately visible to Impala.
Repeatedly ran query_test/test_kudu.py::TestKuduOperations::test_kudu_col_added for 1000 times in impala-private-parameterized, but could not reproduce the issue.
This seems an intermittent failure. Not sure the root cause.
