I'm not working on this right now but I'm happy to mentor someone if they want to pick it up.

I'd like to take a look at it; let me know where to start.

Thanks [~andrew.musselman]
I think you should start by looking at [ParquetWriterBatchCreator here|https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/b4d47c56b6484eedbf3f44516338da4cdbfbb7b4/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/parquet/ParquetWriterBatchCreator.java#L35]
It needs to return a CloseableRecordBatch which is the class that gets the record batches in Columns.
Currently it returns a [WriterRecordBatch|https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/b4d47c56b6484eedbf3f44516338da4cdbfbb7b4/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/parquet/ParquetFormatPlugin.java#L158] which writes records one row at a time to a RecordWriter.
{noformat}return new WriterRecordBatch(writer, incoming, context, getRecordWriter(context, writer));{noformat}
WriterRecordBatch is the common class to write to a row oriented format.
But in this case we'd want to directly convert the columns and not go through a row representation in between


Thanks, will take a look.  How are you taking on patches and doing code reviews, through PRs?

Pull requests sound great.

Looks like WriterRecordBatch extends AbstractRecordBatch which implements CloseableRecordBatch in branch 1.2.0.

First, do you recommend working in master?  I was seeing some test failures at least so tried with a known-decent branch.

Second, I'm a bit confused; would you suggest I write a new impl of CloseableRecordBatch, new extension of AbstractRecordBatch, or something else?

yes just create a branch from master and rebase it as needed.
Tests should pass. If you see flaky tests or things that do not work out of the box please report them.
I think you need to create a subclass of CloseableRecordBatch yes.
