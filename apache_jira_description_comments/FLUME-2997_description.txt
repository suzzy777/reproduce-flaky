testParallelSingleSourceAndSink sometimes trigger an edge case scenario if sinks are slower than sources. In such situations the channel can get full thus uncaught ChannelFullException breaks the test. Since testCapacityWithOverflow was designed to cover such edge-case scenario already we can safely fix the test by increasing the channel capacity to make sure it won't get full.
