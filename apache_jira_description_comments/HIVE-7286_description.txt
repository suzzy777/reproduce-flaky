Currently, HCatMapReduceTest, which is extended by the following test suites:

 * TestHCatDynamicPartitioned
 * TestHCatNonPartitioned
 * TestHCatPartitioned
 * TestHCatExternalDynamicPartitioned
 * TestHCatExternalNonPartitioned
 * TestHCatExternalPartitioned
 * TestHCatMutableDynamicPartitioned
 * TestHCatMutableNonPartitioned
 * TestHCatMutablePartitioned

These tests run against RCFile. Currently, only TestHCatDynamicPartitioned is run against any other storage format (ORC).

Ideally, HCatalog should be tested against all storage formats supported by Hive. The easiest way to accomplish this is to turn HCatMapReduceTest into a parameterized test fixture that enumerates all Hive storage formats. Until HIVE-5976 is implemented, we would need to manually create the mapping of SerDe to InputFormat and OutputFormat. This way, we can explicitly keep track of which storage formats currently work with HCatalog or which ones are untested or have test failures. The test fixture should also use Reflection to find all classes in the classpath that implements the SerDe interface and raise a failure if any of them are not enumerated.
