Motivation

Currently, lines with commented out lines yield additional query result. For the query below, three results will be returned (result for comment is “updated rows: 0“). You can play with the comments position within the entire query, the behavior with comments is not consistent and clear.

-- asdf
SELECT * FROM Test_Person limit 1;
update Test_Person set name='sdfsdf' where id = 44444444;
-- come
-- asdf

What to do

Do not yield a separate query result for commented out lines.
