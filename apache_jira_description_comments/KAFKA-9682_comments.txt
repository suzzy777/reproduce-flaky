KAFKA-9686 is able to fix this issue.

This test case broke with the consolidation of {{addEndOffsets}} and {{updateEndOffsets}} into a single {{updateEndOffsets}} in: [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8220]

Before this PR, {{addEndOffsets}} was unused. 
 However, instead of consolidating {{innerUpdateEndOffsets}} that was called by both methods to become what the public {{updateEndOffsets}} was doing, it was refactored in a way that was actually executed what the unused {{addEndOffsets}} was performing. 

Refactoring should have resulted into decommissioning {{addEndOffsets}} and keeping the original  {{updateEndOffsets}}, not the other way round. 

Do you mean the test is permanently broken?

Have two more failures:

[https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk11-scala2.13/5069/testReport/org.apache.kafka.connect.util/KafkaBasedLogTest/testSendAndReadToEnd/]

and

[https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk8-scala2.12/1050/testReport/org.apache.kafka.connect.util/KafkaBasedLogTest/testSendAndReadToEnd/]

I checkout to https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/fe0b704285ebc916ce5080a5248d91b4dc3c60e0 and then run test "KafkaBasedLogTest#testSendAndReadToEnd". It never pass.

BTW, KafkaBasedLogTest#testSendAndReadToEnd pass if fe0b704285ebc916ce5080a5248d91b4dc3c60e0 is reverted 

Thanks for clarification!

Closing this as "fixed by" KAFKA-9686
