[~thobbs], this is a follow up from CASSANDRA-11598. It seems that basically every part of this test is flaky on 2.1. Should we just skip it before 2.2?

The problem is that we haven't received the tracing events from non-coordinator replicas. The fix was delivered by CASSANDRA-11465 but it only went into 2.2+. We can either skip the test in 2.1 or change the regex in the test and remove the forward slash from the IP address if the version is less than 2.2.

Given that Tyler was once okay with skipping on 2.1, and you seem to be as well, that is preferable to me.

+1 to skipping on 2.1

Pull request merged, test will be skipped in 2.1.
