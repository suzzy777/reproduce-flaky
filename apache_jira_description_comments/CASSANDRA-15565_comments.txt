I've been trying to reproduce with no luck. I've run the test and the suite in loop in CircleCI:
 - [https://circleci.com/gh/jorgebay/cassandra/7]
 - [https://circleci.com/gh/jorgebay/cassandra/12]

I've also run it in loop in my local machine.

From the error message in the ticket, it's related to the initial condition of the test, it expects no other index present. The failure is mostly due to an issue with the cleanup of a prior test.
 I'll submit a patch -using {{KEYSPACE_PER_TEST}}-, that way it will less likely to fail in cascade after another test.

[PR|https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/461] and [CI|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jorgebay/cassandra?branch=CASSANDRA-15565-fix].

Thanks, looks good to me. I've made a small addition to your patch to verify that when dropped, the index is removed from the built indexes table. From the name, it seemed like that should've been part of the test all along. I've committed to 3.0 and merged to 3.11 & trunk.

While reviewing an unrelated patch today I came across a new but similar failure in this test:Â https://circleci.com/gh/jrwest/cassandra/429#tests/containers/56
