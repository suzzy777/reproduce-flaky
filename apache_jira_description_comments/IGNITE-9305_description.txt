Was troubleshooting an Ignite deployment today and couldn't find out from the logs what was the actual off-heap space used. 

Those were the given memory resoures (Ignite 2.6):

{code}
[2018-08-16 15:07:49,961][INFO ][main][GridDiscoveryManager] Topology snapshot [ver=1, servers=1, clients=0, CPUs=64, offheap=30.0GB, heap=24.0GB]
{code}

And that weird stuff was reported by the node (pay attention to the last line):

{code}
[2018-08-16 15:45:50,211][INFO ][grid-timeout-worker-#135%cluster_31-Dec-2017%][IgniteKernal%cluster_31-Dec-2017] 
Metrics for local node (to disable set 'metricsLogFrequency' to 0)
    ^-- Node [id=c033026e, name=cluster_31-Dec-2017, uptime=00:38:00.257]
    ^-- H/N/C [hosts=1, nodes=1, CPUs=64]
    ^-- CPU [cur=0.03%, avg=5.54%, GC=0%]
    ^-- PageMemory [pages=6997377]
    ^-- Heap [used=9706MB, free=61.18%, comm=22384MB]
    ^-- Non heap [used=144MB, free=-1%, comm=148MB] - this line is always the same!
{code}

Had to change the code by using {code}dataRegion.getPhysicalMemoryPages(){code} to find out that actual off-heap usage size was 
{code}
>>> Physical Memory Size: 28651614208 => 27324 MB, 26 GB
{code}


The logs have to report the following instead:
{code}
 ^-- Off-heap {Data Region 1} [used={dataRegion1.getPhysicalMemorySize()}, free=X%, comm=dataRegion1.maxSize()]
 ^-- Off-heap {Data Region 2} [used={dataRegion2.getPhysicalMemorySize()}, free=X%, comm=dataRegion2.maxSize()]
{code}

If Ignite persistence is enabled then the following extra lines have to be added to see the disk used space:
{code}
 ^-- Ignite persistence {Data Region 1}: used={dataRegion1.getTotalAllocatedSize() - dataRegion1.getPhysicalMemorySize()}
 ^-- Ignite persistence {Data Region 2} [used={dataRegion2.getTotalAllocatedSize() - dataRegion2.getPhysicalMemorySize()}]
{code}
