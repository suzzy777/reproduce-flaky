This was a table name clash...both tests used the same name for the test table.

I was able to reproduce the issue with:
{code}
mvn install test=TestJdbcWithSQLAuthorization,TestJdbcWithSQLAuthUDFBlacklist -Pitests
{code}

patch#1) rename one of the tables

+1. Looks good. Thanks [~kgyrtkirk]. I'd like to delay the commit to test some additional cleanup in the ptest execution script (batch-exec.vm).

Think we should have a subsequent jira which ensure both of these tests cleanup before / after they run.

Committed. Created HIVE-15008 to add cleanup to the mentioned tests.
