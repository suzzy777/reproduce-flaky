ATTACHMENT ID: 12829791 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build

Failures seem unrelated, most were failing before, the one test which failed with this run is flaky.

LGTM +1

Pushed to master.
Thanks [~zsombor.klara] for your contribution!

Should this be documented in the wiki?

[~leftylev] I tried to look for a section about the existing metrics on the wiki, but I only found the one about the properties configuring the metrics. If there is one about the metrics themselves then I would appreciate if you could point me to it, and I will of course update it.
If we don't have a list of the existing metrics, then it would probably be a good idea to start one.

Agreed, the wiki needs to document Hive metrics.  I'm not sure where they belong -- perhaps in a new wikidoc, or a section of the Hive Web UI doc -- what do you think, [~zsombor.klara]?

* [Hive Web Interface | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveWebInterface]

The metrics show up on the debug webUI of the HiveServer2, so we shouldn't mix them with the HWI. Maybe we should have a child page under [HiveServer2 Overview|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Overview] for this?

Good plan, [~zsombor.klara].  (I was mixing up the two web interfaces, thanks for setting me straight.)

I just created the child page "Hive Metrics" -- if you have a better title, please change it.  I  listed all the metrics in MetricsConstant.java but wasn't sure how to deal with the prefixes for HS2 & SQL operations.

* [Hive Metrics | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Metrics]

Versions and JIRA issues for all the metrics will be added after a bit of research.

What about other metrics, such as LLAP metrics created by HIVE-13536?

A Metrics Dump screen shot would be helpful too.

[~zsombor.klara], will you have time to work on the metrics documentation?

Or should I create a new JIRA issue for documenting metrics?

[~leftylev] I will add some more content today, thanks for reminding me.
I was thinking of adding a screenshot and the way to view the metrics (besides the Metrics tab we have JMX and I think a JSON file as well). Is there anything else you think could be useful?
And thank you for creating the page and adding the current metrics with the jiras.

That's great, thanks!

The metrics names in the screen shot don't correspond to any names in the list that was taken from MetricsConstant.java.  Would it be possible to compile a complete list, say, from a text file of the metrics dump?  Would it even be useful?

Perhaps we just need to make it clear that the list shown in the wiki is far from complete.  Or we could delete the list, although I like having a record of which releases introduced various metrics.

I will add the missing metrics. They are coming from the PerfLogger which can be used on top of the Metrics API to measure the time taken to execute any piece of code within Hive, and we are using it in a number of cases.

Thanks very much.
