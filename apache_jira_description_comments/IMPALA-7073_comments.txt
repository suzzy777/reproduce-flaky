I added this test so I'll take it for now. I'm guessing it's a out-of-date profile, i.e. IMPALA-6338 but there's not enough context here to diagnose.

IMPALA-7073: skip TestScannerReservation on non-miniclusters

The test is (sort of) tuned for miniclusters and is very targeted
to testing a specific code path, rather than general functional
correctness, so we don't really need coverage on all filesystems.
