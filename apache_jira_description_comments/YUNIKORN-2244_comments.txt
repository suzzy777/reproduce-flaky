Just have a quick check on the error, the error happened on ginkgo.AfterSuite and might not specific to user_group_limit.
{code:go}
ginkgo.By("Check Yunikorn's health")
checks, err := yunikorn.GetFailedHealthChecks()
{code}
There have data inconsistency when health check compare sum of nodes total allocation/resources to partition's total allocation/resources.

The root cause might be that those numbers are hold by different objects
 * Partition allocation: record in root *Queue
 * Partition resources: record in *PartitionContext
 * Node allocation: record in *Node
 * Node resources: record in *Node

YuniKorn didn't hold partition/node locks together when performing update. The primary concern is likely related to performance. Therefore, the inconsistency is as expected.
I think one possible solution is we can add retry to AfterSuite's health check or just remove it from AfterSuite.


Please correct me if I'm wrong.
