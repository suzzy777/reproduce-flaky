This jira serves as a parent with the objective of being able to delete AutoCommitTest and HardAutoCommitTest -- w/o any loss in what core functionality is being tested -- by adding equivilent test logic to SoftAutoCommitTest using the (superior) strategies currently found in SoftAutoCommitTest.

Sub-Tasks will be used to track the discrete changes to be made, so we can phase them in gradually.
