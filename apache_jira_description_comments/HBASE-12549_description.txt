TestAssignmentManagerOnCluster#testAssignRacingWithSSH() runs on average 40 sec, with 60 sec timeout. This causes flakiness. 

The fix is easy. One of the earlier tests increases the hbase.assignment.maximum.attempts from 3 to 10. Then testAssignRacingWithSSH() is ran with 10 attempts causing slowness.
