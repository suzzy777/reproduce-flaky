The test looks right. Most failures I could track down are half-way through completed the problem being it is a time sensitive test. That aligns to the flakiness that can be observed in heavily loaded envs such as ci-cass. I raised timeout for the time being. If that still causes issues then we'd have to look into refactoring the whole test and remove the time sensitiveness.

I haven't been able to reproduce the timeout neither locally nor in 100 runs of internal CI. Raising the timeout looks like a good solution to me, +1.

Unfortunately,  I saw it again in the latest build:

https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/244/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.net/ProxyHandlerConnectionsTest/testExpireSomeFromBatch/

Indeed this is still failing with the same error, we should probably reopen this ticket. I'm running the test method in the multiplexer again ([here|https://jenkins-dse.build.dsinternal.org/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized-testall/683/]), this time with 500 runs. I'm also running the entire suite in the multiplexer ([here|https://jenkins-dse.build.dsinternal.org/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized-testall/684/]), to see if the reproduction depends on interactions.

Let's reopen then. I am deep in another mysterious ticket. I can look at this one next. Thx! 

bq. I'm running the test method in the multiplexer again ([here|https://jenkins-dse.build.dsinternal.org/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized-testall/683/]), this time with 500 runs. I'm also running the entire suite in the multiplexer ([here|https://jenkins-dse.build.dsinternal.org/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized-testall/684/]), to see if the reproduction depends on interactions.
Of the aforementioned runs only the one running the entire {{ProxyHandlerConnectionsTest}} suite 100 times has reproduced the error once.

Thanks for the info!

I was also able to reproduce this issue on an m4.xlarge with 4 cpus with 2 runners (as shown in the example above). I saw 10 failures out of 500 runs. I also noticed with 1 runner on this same instance type the issue did not appear.

 

With a m4.2xlarge with 8 cpus, running with 2 runners did not reproduce the issue. 

 

I may be stating the obvious, but there appears to be some sensitivity between the number of runners used for parallelizing the tests and the number of cpus available on the host.

Rocco will not be working on this one more so I am moving it back to unassigned

There are a couple problems with this test.  The first is that if messages are dropped, which can often be expected, it results in an NPE that complicates further debugging.  The timeout for this test itself does not actually matter, since it is manipulating timing windows that it later assert results upon.  These all work in a perfect world, but inside the JVM need some relaxing to allow for the real world to get in the way. Patch [here|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra/tree/CASSANDRA-16358], [CI here|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/388/], that addresses both of these.  After being able to reproduce the issue within hundreds of runs, I've had success in thousands with this.

I trust you that you ran it 1000 times(I mean I ran it only a few times locally successfully  but I was not able to reproduce it before :( ), code-wise looks good to me. Thanks!
