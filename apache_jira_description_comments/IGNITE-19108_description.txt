Currently, a "strange" case has been observed where a user has initialized a cluster with auth enabled while being connected. After successful initialization, the next command such as cluster config show would fail, which is expected. However, the session indication (green prompt) was not changed, and it caused confusion for users.

To prevent this confusion and improve the user experience, it is suggested to introduce a connection check mechanism that will check the connection status on a set schedule and indicate whether it is stable or failed. This will help users easily identify when the connection is not stable and take necessary actions.

With the proposed mechanism in place, the above-described case would look like this:

- Initiate cluster with auth enabled
- Confirm the operation is successful
- Observe the connection is unstable (the prompt turns yellow)
- Optionally, set cli config and see the session turn green
- After some time, if the connection remains unstable, the prompt turns red, indicating an explicit reconnect is required.
