[~peeyushb]: For FALCON-1491 I see that you modified getTotalEnqueueCount for TOPIC_NAME and not SECONDARY_TOPIC_NAME. CAn flakiness in this test be caused because of your changes?!

[~sowmyaramesh] I ran the tests from the patch FALCON-1491 many times and did not see this exception. But will take a look once.

On looking the issue, it looks like that count of elements sent to the destination is not coming proper on build machines for upgraded Activemq 5.12.0. 

{code:java}
Assert.assertEquals(adminView.getTotalEnqueueCount(), 11);
{code}

But while running this test case in my environment (mac os), count is coming as expected.
If falcon build fails again with similar exception, we will disable the tests to avoid further failure and debug it.

Build #806 again failed with similar exception. It looks like that after upgrading to Activemq-5.12.0 count of enqueue elements for a given topic has been changed internally in Activemq. Just figuring out the way to identify how many elements has been sent to the destination. Also this count of elements/objects in unit test cases many times are not reliable.

If I fix this exception by setting count of enqueue elements to 10 instead of 11, build will fail on Mac OS. This is because on Mac OS, it is expecting 11 enqueue elements instead of 10. 

So for now I will disable this unreliable test case and will work on to improve it.
