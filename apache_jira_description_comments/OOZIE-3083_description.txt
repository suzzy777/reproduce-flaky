OOZIE-2004 changed the format of the version info output considerably.
We should change it back to a more compatible format.

It could be something like
{code}
{"buildVersion":"5.0.0-SNAPSHOT", "buildInfo":"{build.time=${build.time}, vc.url=${vc.url}, build.user=asasvari, vc.revision=${vc.revision}"}
{code}
