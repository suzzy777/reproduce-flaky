[~alex-mesos] added the verbose output for this test, we're seeing it as pretty flaky, can you take a look?

I cannot reproduce the failure on Ubuntu with {{GTEST_FILTER=SlaveTest.MesosExecutorGracefulShutdown ./mesos-tests.sh  --gtest_repeat=1000 --gtest_break_on_failure}}

From the logs it looks like a simple {{sleep}} task doesn't terminate (or is not being reaped) in 3s period. What hardware is your CI running on? Is it overloaded? If this can be the case, we can try to increase the default escalation interval a bit.

From the output, we're not seeing 'Terminated' in the output, which means that it's the SIGKILL reaching the pid, not the SIGTERM, no? Because of this, it doesn't seem like it's a reaping issue, anything I'm missing?

Looks like this to me as well, these are VMs and we sometimes see strange blocking behavior. I've bumped the timeout for now and included a nicer error message. Please take a look:

Yes, let's increase the timeout for now and circle back if the test will still be flaky.

Let's see if this crops up again:

    Increased the timeout for the flaky SlaveTest.CommandExecutorGracefulShutdown test.

Turns out this change didn't increase 3 second timeout in the command executor after all, I'll follow up.

Ben, I can confirm this issue. I'm on it, sorry for the inconvenience!

That's ok, I have some cleanups that I'll send your way as well. But a test that can catch this would be great!

In the process of fixing this issue, I did a number of cleanups related to this stuff:

https://reviews.apache.org/r/30579/

https://reviews.apache.org/r/30583/

https://reviews.apache.org/r/30596/
https://reviews.apache.org/r/30597/
https://reviews.apache.org/r/30601/

This test has been reverted for 0.22.0 along with the other grace period changes.
