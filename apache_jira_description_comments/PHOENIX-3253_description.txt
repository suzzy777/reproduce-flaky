Changes are necessary in our BaseHBaseTimeManagedIT tests to ensure that they can run in parallel:
- Using unique table names in all tests
- Removing any usage of BaseTest.ensureTableCreated()
- Change static methods and member variables to be instance level
- Remove any required state dependencies between tests
