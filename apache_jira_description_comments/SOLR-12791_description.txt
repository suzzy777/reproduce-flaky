Propose to add Metrics support for all Auth plugins. Will let abstract {{AuthenticationPlugin}} base class implement {{SolrMetricProducer}} and keep the counters, such as:
 * requests
 * req authenticated
 * req pass-through (no credentials and blockUnknown false)
 * req with auth failures due to wrong or malformed credentials
 * req auth failures due to missing credentials
 * errors
 * timeouts
 * timing stats

Each implementation still needs to increment the counters etc.
