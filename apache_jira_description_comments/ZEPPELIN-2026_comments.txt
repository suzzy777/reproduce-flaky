    [ZEPPELIN-2026] Flaky Test: WebDriverManager.getWebDriver() fails with Unable to locate element 'WebSocket Connected'

    ### What is this PR for?
    Selenium test sometimes fails with 
    
    ```
    Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//i[@tooltip='WebSocket Connected']"}
    ```
    
    This PR gives enough timeout (30s) for waiting 'WebSocket Connected' element.
    
    Tested in my travis account 5 times and they're all green.
    https://travis-ci.org/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin/builds/196428795
    https://travis-ci.org/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin/builds/196429337
    https://travis-ci.org/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin/builds/196429559
    https://travis-ci.org/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin/builds/196429593
    https://travis-ci.org/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin/builds/196430020
    
    However, I'm not 100% sure if it really fixes the flaky test.
    So, I'd like to merge this PR but keep ZEPPELIN-2026 open for next 1 week.
    And then see if no selenium test fails with the error for next 1 week to close ZEPPELIN-2026.
