Note that Datastore dependency currently used in Beam is not python3-compatible, so we'll have to skip Datastore tests.

Hi, I'm working on upgrading Beam's datastore client dependency.
How would I test Python 3 compatibility once ready?

Hi [~udim], thanks for upgrading the Datastore dependency. You could:

1. Make sure existing ~35 datastore unit tests pass on Python 2.
2. Modify setup.py to remove the restriction that prevents installation of datastore client library on Python 3: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/3e7e0346492f9c70903590c50133f9f5a5acf9ee/sdks/python/setup.py#L143.
3. Run Datastore unit tests in Python 3. You can follow https://s.apache.org/beam-py3-conversion-quick-start for instructions. Chances are  some tests may still be failing for other reasons, since not all IO tests currently work in Python 3.

Eventually, we should run all tests in IO module as part of Python 3 presubmit suite, currently we only run a subset: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/3e7e0346492f9c70903590c50133f9f5a5acf9ee/sdks/python/tox.ini#L61.

Closing this issue, let's track any outstanding open items in separate issues associated with particular IOs.
