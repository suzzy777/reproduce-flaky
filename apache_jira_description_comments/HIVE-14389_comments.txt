[~pvary] [~thejas] Can you please review?

Hi @vihang,

Thanks for the patch. We should clean up the BeeLine output!

Checked the patch, overall it looks good to me, just a few questions:
- Could you please test the cases provided in HIVE-14525 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-14525?focusedCommentId=15432183&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15432183)
- I am not really understand why the output is changes (Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE), or why we have to remove the extra spaces around "nonEscapedSemiColon". Do you know what caused the change?

Other than these, the patch looks good to me.

Thanks,
Peter
 

Thanks for the review [~pvary]. I manually tested against the test cases in HIVE-14525 like you pointed and they seem to be working fine.

Here is the output of the test cases
{noformat}
vihang-MBP:bin vihang$ cat /tmp/test.sql
select * from names;
vihang-MBP:bin vihang$ beeline --showheader=false --outputformat=tsv2 >stdout 2>stderr -f /tmp/test.sql 1>stdout 2>stderr
vihang-MBP:bin vihang$
vihang-MBP:bin vihang$
vihang-MBP:bin vihang$ cat stdout
1	John
2	Jack
3	Tom
4	Jerry
{noformat}

{noformat}
vihang-MBP:bin vihang$ echo -e 'select\n"foo",\n"bar"' | beeline --showheader=false --outputformat=tsv2 >stdout 2>stderr
vihang-MBP:bin vihang$ cat stdout
foo	bar
{noformat}

{noformat}
vihang-MBP:bin vihang$ ssh localhost test1.sh
Running bash_profile
vihang-MBP:bin vihang$
vihang-MBP:bin vihang$ cat stdout
foo	bar
vihang-MBP:bin vihang$
{noformat}

For the second comment regarding Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE, I think I misunderstood the test. I have reverted that part of the change. I realized that {{" nonEscapedSemiColon "}} is needs to be compared from the query text part of the code instead of query result. With this patch the query text will be moved to stderr and hence we need to look for that text in the STDERR. Thanks for catching that!

+1 (non binding)

If you have time it might be a good idea to add a negative test as well, so we can be sure, that the prompt, and warnings and so on is not showing up in the out. But it might be an overkill. What do you think?

[~vihangk1], are the test failures related? Especially org.apache.hive.beeline.TestBeeLineWithArgs.testTabInScriptFile ?  Thanks

Fixed the test failure. Also added some negative tests as per Peter's suggestion

PATCH 4 looks good.  +1

vector_if_expr is a flaky test reported in HIVE-15776. explainanalyze_3 and explainuser_3 have been failing since last many builds and unrelated to this patch. [~ychena] Can this be merged? Thanks!

Push to master and branch-2, thanks [~vihangk1] for your contribution. 

Hi. I was not getting the query even after i used --verbose=true. I have to redirect the output with the query into a text file.

Hi [~sanmanganthe] Can you please provide more details with an example? Do you mean that the query is not available on stderr as well?

Command:
beeline --verbose=true -f hadoop_query.hql > test.txt

Output in test.txt
+---------------+-----------------+-
| column 1  	| column 2  	  |
+---------------+-----------------+-
| A             | AAAAAA          |
| A             | AAAAAA          |
| A             | AAAAAA          |
| A             | AAAAAA          |

I want to see the query and output. This is what we would get before HDP 2.6.2
<Query from hql file> 
+---------------+-----------------+-
| column 1  	| column 2  	  |
+---------------+-----------------+-
| A             | AAAAAA          |
| A             | AAAAAA          |
| A             | AAAAAA          |
| A             | AAAAAA          |

Thats the behavior which was fixed by this patch. The query text should not be mixed with the results because if you want to process the results (to load as data somewhere else for example)  then you will have to manually clean it up by removing the query text. You can always add the query text to your results file if really want by redirecting the stderr to the same file using {{beeline --verbose=true -f hadoop_query.hql > test.txt 2>&1}}

Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.
