When the test is already flaky in master branch, developer has to check if possible failures in PR are the same as in master branch. As for now, this is done manually by analyzing build history on TeamCity. TC Bot can simplify this process in the following way:

* When both error descriptions from PR/master build logs start with identical substring, then the failure should not be reported.
* Otherwise test failure should be reported.

Example of potentially identical substring:
{noformat}
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
    at org.apache.ignite.internal.GridVersionSelfTest.testVersions(GridVersionSelfTest.java:54)
{noformat}
