Kafka client version in Samza is currently at 2.0.1. This client is now at 2.7.0 with enhancements, bug fixes and security patches.

We should upgrade Samza to the latest version to benefit from this.

The problem is Scala 2.11 support was droppd in 2.5.0. 
Therefore we should upgrade to 2.3.1 to make it a quick easy upgrade and gain many of the benefits since the current Samza Kafka client version of 2.0.1. [Release Notes|https://kafka.apache.org/downloads]
