I wasn't able to reproduce this hanging locally. May be the cause was fixed in the some previous tasks.

But this test is still flaky on [TC|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_MvccQueries&tab=buildTypeHistoryList&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F5859%2Fhead]

[~amashenkov], please review the patch. Tests are ok. 
The reason of the test blinking is the race when {{TestDiscoverySpi}} should swallow prepare messages from the first transaction, but sometimes it swallows several prepare messages from the first transaction and at least one prepare message issued by the second transaction. In this case second transaction hangs and tests fails. The fix is to wait for all prepare messages from the first tx is arrived and then start the second one.

[~amashenkov], test looks good on TC:Â [https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&testNameId=4342993177608979203&tab=testDetails&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F5859%2Fhead|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&testNameId=4342993177608979203&tab=testDetails&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F5859%2Fhead]

Merged to master.
Thanks for contribution!
