Pull request: [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6922]

Added a wait condition on the state of the Kafka client that waits until the state is RUNNING. If the Kafka client reaches state RUNNING, there should not be flakiness anymore. If it still fails, it is definitely an issue in the transition to RUNNING and not a metric registration issue.
