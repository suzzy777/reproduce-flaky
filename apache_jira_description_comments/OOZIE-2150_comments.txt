I agree that this would be a nice feature, but it won't work nicely all the time - a shell action isn't necessarily running a script (you can ship and run a binary, or use an interpreter in <exec> and a a script as an argument). 

I imagine you could catch many/most cases if you use a library (e.g. http://tika.apache.org/ ) to guess the type of file in <exec>, and print it if it doesn't look like an executable.

if this approach makes sense, I could work on this.

[~jacobtolar] I have assigned JIRA to you.

This detects whether the file is binary by checking for a null byte in the file. This is similar to the heuristic that git ( https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/xdiff-interface.c#L198-L204 ), curl ( https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/06/17/curl-doesnt-spew-binary-anymore/ ), and other tools use.

It also only prints out the script contents if it's not too big (arbitrarily, 128KiB).
