The {{HmsSentryConfigurations/MasterStressTest}} seems to be a bit flaky if running via dist-test with {{--stress_cpu_threads=16}}.  A snippet of the {{master-stress-test}} binary's output (DEBUG build) is below.  It seems the configuration was 
{{ HmsMode::ENABLE_METASTORE_INTEGRATION, SentryMode::DISABLED }}.  Also, I'm attaching a full log.
