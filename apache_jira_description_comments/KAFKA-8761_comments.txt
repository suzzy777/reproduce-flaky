These tests have been disabled in trunk this morning so you probably just need to rebase.

Update this ticket as blocker for 2.4 to make sure we double check in enabling those tests (or make a judgement call to leave the disable risking reduces test coverage).

Hello [~ableegoldman]Â and [~mjsax]

I have tried to check the reports:

[https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk11-scala2.12/6740/testReport/junit/kafka.api/AdminClientIntegrationTest/testIncrementalAlterConfigsForLog4jLogLevels/]

[https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk11-scala2.12/6834/testReport/junit/kafka.api/AdminClientIntegrationTest/testIncrementalAlterConfigsForLog4jLogLevels/]

But it shows a 404, it is because I do not have permissions to see that content or actually the page of the test report is gone?
