Change to Public interfaces without deprecation:

HTableDescriptor
Field DEFAULT_NORMALIZATION_ENABLED of type boolean has been removed from this class.

TableDescriptorBuilder
Field DEFAULT_NORMALIZATION_ENABLED of type boolean has been removed from this class.

RandomRowFilter
Field random of type java.util.Random has been removed from this class. 	A client program may be interrupted by NoSuchFieldError exception.

ReplicationLoadSink.ReplicationLoadSink ( long age, long timestamp, long timestampStarted, long totalOpsProcessed ) 
Access level has been changed from public to private. 	A client program may be interrupted by IllegalAccessError exception.

RSGroupInfo.getServers:()Ljava/util/Set;
Return value type has been changed from java.util.Set<org.apache.hadoop.hbase.net.Address> to java.util.SortedSet<org.apache.hadoop.hbase.net.Address>. 
This method has been removed because the return type is part of the method signature. A client program may be interrupted by NoSuchMethodError exception.

These changes are not allowed by policy for a minor release so I have committed fixes on my own authority as RM to branch-2.5 and branch-2. Further changes can be pursued on branch-2.
