looking at the code I see the following

{code}
Assert.assertTrue(lastSchemaChangeResult instanceof ResultMessage.SchemaChange);
ResultMessage.SchemaChange schemaChange = (ResultMessage.SchemaChange) lastSchemaChangeResult; // fails with java.lang.ClassCastException here
{code}

This implies concurrent modification, so looked for anything that creates modifications async and found org.apache.cassandra.cql3.CQLTester#afterTest does, so this would make this logic not thread safe (no memory barriers to make sure visible), and would make all tests that check this state unsafe as it can change after the test changes the schema.

Hey [~dcapwell], do you plan on working on this one?Â 

nope, feel free to take =D

Hello Can I take this one? It seems like a good start

I haven't started it, feel free to take it [~cedric.nabaa]

[~cedric.nabaa] are you still planning on working on this one?

Hi, I see no activity from [~cedric.nabaa] for the last month nor a reply so I hijacked this one. I hope that is ok, apologies otherwise.

+1 from me assuming https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/782/files#r510370433 is resolved.

Addressed and latest CI in PR.

+1 from me

[~dcapwell] there is a new proposal in the PR from [~blerer] in case you missed the GH update #collborating

[~blerer] I think with both +1 from you and David we can merge your proposal now :-)

The problem is affecting previous versions too. Backporting the patch for those.
