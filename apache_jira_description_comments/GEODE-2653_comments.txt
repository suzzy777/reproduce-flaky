GEODE-2653: Add FlakyTest category to test with Thread.sleep


GitHub user galen-pivotal opened a pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/437

    GEODE-2653: Fix testRemoveMember and remove FlakyTest.

    And do some cleanup while I'm here:
     * Change Mockito's `any` to `isA`.
     * Replace some `Thread.sleep()` calls with Awaitility calls.
     * Remove our `MethodExecuted` class -- this can be done with Mockito's`verify()`.

    Test removed self instead of the other member, and used the `any`
    matcher instead of `isA`.
