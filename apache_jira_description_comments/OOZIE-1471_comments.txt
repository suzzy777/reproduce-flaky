patch on RB
https://reviews.apache.org/r/13030/

not very trilled about this (as it can easily hog the NN if using a broad wildcard), but if we do it we should support chgroup and chmod as well.

yes understand concern of NN pressure, but this has been highly-requested feature from customers, lack of this hurts usability.
looking at average use case at Y!, it doesn't give as much pressure, but there could be possibility that flawed workflow that novice user writes might incur huge load, and could be aggravated when it runs several time by coordinator or something.  
one idea is to set upper bound in # of files to do FS operation, and if exceeds, fail workflow. (we still cannot avoid one-time fs.globStatus upfront, but at least can notify users earlier and urge them to fix workflow), any thought?

also I'll add support for chgroup/chmod, thanks 

sound good
