2023-03-17T03:42:54,025 WARN  [Listener at localhost.localdomain/33967] wal.AbstractFSWALProvider(418): Cannot parse a server name from path=hdfs://localhost.localdomain:43341/home/jenkins/jenkins-home/workspace/HBase-Flaky-Tests_master/hbase-server/target/test-data/2f21d1db-c0f9-6ebc-17f1-124f110a5427/WALs/testEOFExceptionInOldWALsDirectory_1_ isCompressionEnabled=true]/testEOFExceptionInOldWALsDirectory_1_+isCompressionEnabled%3Dtrue%5D.1679024573986; null

I think first we need to find out the reason why it can not parse, and second we should guard against this error so at least usrs can know the reason is parsing server name error, instead of getting a runtime exception.

I think the problem is that, as now we will close the WAL file asynchronously, it is possible when calling cleanOldLogs after rolling, the WAL file has not been closed yet so the rename operation will fail.

Let me think how to fix this. In general, I think we should call cleanOldLogs right after the writer has been successfully closed.

[~vjasani] FYI.

Interesting! Btw the initial rollout of hbase 2.4 that we are doing still has FSHLog implementation (just to keep diff as minimal with hbase 1.x as possible to help debug any major regression in production).

But yeah for this issue it seems cleanOldLogs after writer close would be good.

Pushed to branch-2.4+.

Thanks [~vjasani] for reviewing!
