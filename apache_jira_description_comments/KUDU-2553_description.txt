The {{RpcStubTest.TestDumpCallsInFlight}} scenario of the {{rpc_stub-test}} is flaky in ASAN builds:

{noformat}
kudu/src/kudu/rpc/rpc_stub-test.cc:623: Failure
      Expected: 1                                                               
To be equal to: dump_resp.inbound_connections(0).calls_in_flight_size()         
      Which is: 0                                                    
{noformat}

The detailed log file is attached.

Probably, KUDU-2394 is relevant here: using the similar approach would likely to help fixing this flake.
