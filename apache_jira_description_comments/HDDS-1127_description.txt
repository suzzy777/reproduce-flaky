Full Ozone build with acceptance + unit tests takes ~1.5 hour.

In the last 30 hours I executed a new full build at every 2 hours and collected all the results.

We have ~1200 test method and ~15 are failed more than 4 times out of the 17 run.

I propose the following method to fix them:
 # Turn them off immediately (@Skip) to get real data for the pre-commits
 # Create aÂ Jira for every failing tests *with assignee* (I would choose an assignee based on the history of the unit test). We can adjust the assignee later but I would prefer use a default person instead of creating unassigned jira-s.
 # Fix them and enable the tests again.
