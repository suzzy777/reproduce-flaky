exchange partition event is not generating notifications in notification_log.
There should multiple events generated. one add_partition event and several drop_partition events.
for example:
{noformat}
ALTER TABLE tab1 EXCHANGE PARTITION (part=1) WITH TABLE tab2;
{noformat}

There should be the following events:
ADD_PARTITION on tab2 on partition (part=1)
DROP_PARTITION on tab1 on partition (part=1)
