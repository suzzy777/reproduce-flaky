I'll take this for a few minutes and see if it can be fixed via a revert of something, then hand it back.

    This temporarily adds `@Ignore` to the test class since I don't know what the problem is. Just restoring signal for precommit and postcommit maven install to give time to investigate fully.

Thanks for the quick fix, I will take a look, the hard thing is going to be to find a consistent way to reproduce the issue.

At first, I thought it was a nondeterministic failure that would be hard to reproduce, but when I looked at the Jenkins history, it was every single build. It also hung on my machine when I was running my "verify then push" script to merge someone's PR. So hopefully it won't be too hard.

I validated and there are 4 tests failing in the class, it is basically the testReading tests. I have a branch with only those been @Ignored, and the other tests work ok. The issue is easily reproducible as you said (at least).

My current theory is that we are leaking somehow an unwanted version of guava and/or protobuf  into the IO deps, probably a consequence of some recent changes (fn api+runner api+other thing adding a dep?). HBase uses old versions of both libraries: Guava 12.0.1 and Protobuf 2.5.0. I changed the beam dependencies to version 0.5.0 and fixed a small compilation issue on the IO, and everything worked perfectly. Further investigation is still needed.


Is this still happening?

Yes, it is, I have isolated the concrete case, the tests break only on Read tests, but I am not sure exactly of the reason, my current theory is an issue with the Scan serialization (that uses Protobuf), and since we are not shading protobuf in the other Beam modules I think this can be the source of the issue, but I still have to confirm this.

    [BEAM-1550] Fix HBaseIO tests and change HBaseIO to use shaded dependencies

----


Changed HBase dependencies to use shaded versions, and it seems to have fixed this, and also another issue with colliding versions of guava when using the PTransforms.
