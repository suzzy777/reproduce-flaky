The [code for the jenkins junit plugin|https://github.com/jenkinsci/junit-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/hudson/tasks/junit/CaseResult.java#L190] indicates stdout/stderr logs should be truncated to 1MiB for failing runs, and just 1 KiB for passing runs. However _all_ Beam tests seem to be truncated to 1 KiB, not just passing runs. This can make it very difficult to debug flaky tests, since they are challenging to reproduce locally, and nearly all the relevant information from the failures is removed.
