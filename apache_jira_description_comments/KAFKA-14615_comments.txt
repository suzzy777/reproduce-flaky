[~divijvaidya] I am looking into this issue now. I am new to the project, so it will take some time for me to open the PR. I hope that's fine! 

Hey Kamalesh

Thank you for your interest in making this contribution. However, as you may have noticed, this Jira is targeted for version 4.0. Our trunk is currently tracking 3.5 and hence, this Jira is not ready to be picked up as yet.

Oh okay. How do I find out Jira tasks related to bugs/improvements that need to be made for the latest version i.e. 3.5?

You can either start with list of items labelled as "newbie" here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14218?jql=project%20%3D%20KAFKA%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20labels%20in%20(Newbie%2C%20newbie%2C%20%22newbie%2C%22%2C%20%22newbie%2B%2B%22%2C%20newbiee%2C%20newbiew)%20AND%20assignee%20in%20(EMPTY)%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC%2C%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC 

OR you could start by looking at and fixing flaky tests here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14533?jql=project%20%3D%20KAFKA%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20flaky-test%20AND%20assignee%20in%20(EMPTY)%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC%2C%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC 

OR if you want to look at items that are targeted to be in 3.5, you can check: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14305?jql=project%20%3D%20KAFKA%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%203.5.0%20AND%20assignee%20in%20(EMPTY)%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC%2C%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC 

Let me know if you are still not able to find an item that you like after going through the above list. I can point you to some low hanging items.

FYI, there is an open PR to migrate/convert the JmxTool as part of KAFKA-14525.
