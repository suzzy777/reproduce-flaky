This is a problem with the test: the invariant is good to keep but the test clearly don't respect it since it re-generate a timestamp for each query. We can easily generate the "nowInSeconds" value once during static initialization of the class and use that for all commands as far as this test is concerned. [~jkni]: care to provide a patch for that?

I've pushed a patch to 3.0 [here|https://github.com/jkni/cassandra/commits/10754-3.0].

I've changed all explicit references to {{nowInSeconds}} to a value generated once during static initialization of the class.

I haven't run CI since this only affects one unit test; I induced the original flaky failure by adding a sleep in command construction and confirmed that the above patch solves the issues.  All other tests in the class still pass.

+1, committed, thanks.
