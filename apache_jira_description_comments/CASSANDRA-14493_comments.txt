We already have tests that cover DESCRIBE statements for indexes and schemas (in the test_describe dtest in cassandra-dtest cqlsh_tests/cqlsh_tests.py). Coverage analysis shows we're exercising those functions after fixing flakiness in test_describe.

Also, a "usertype" is not a separate thing from a "type" in the context of DESCRIBE statements, so no separate testing will be needed for describing types vs. describing usertypes.

We still need additional testing to exercise describing aggregates, functions, and (user defined) types.

DESCRIBE AGGREGATE and DESCRIBE FUNCTION are done. DESCRIBE for user defined types is next on my list.

Added a new test for DESCRIBE TYPE.

Demonstrated existing coverage for describing indexes and schemas, and added new tests for describing functions, aggregates, and user defined types.
