In SyncFuture, NOT_DONE = 0. The initial value of the ringBuffer is -1. So ringBuffer.next() gives 0 for the first call. If we create a SyncFuture with sequence = 0, even when we set it's done (ie. doneSequence = 0), it is still not done since doneSequence == NOT_DONE == 0.  Can we set NOT_DONE to -1, and the initial doneSequence to -2?
