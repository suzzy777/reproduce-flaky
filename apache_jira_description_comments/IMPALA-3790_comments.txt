[~hsheinblatt_impala_e511] dup of IMPALA-3772? cc: [~mjacobs]

Yeah this is probably the same. I have a patch that has been +2'd, just waiting for gvms to work to get it in.

IMPALA-3772

Looks like this is not a dupe of IMPALA-3772 as I had hoped-- this still particular issue as described still happens even with the fix for IMPALA-3772. It appears to happen on the code coverage build, and I cannot reproduce this locally, so something seems different on the code coverage boxes/environments somehow. It's weird because it looks like the test isn't really making any progress, they're failing right after the first set of queries are submitted.

This doesn't reproduce for me in my environment when I run these exhaustive tests with a code coverage build. My best guess right now is that there are very severe performance implications of running the code coverage run. I'm testing running a private job now with a codecoverage  build and testing just custom cluster tests to see if I can repro this without using the full code coverage jenkins job, which is huge and slow. If I can, then I'll try just increasing the timeouts.

I could get these tests to pass if I extended the timeouts significantly, e.g. from 30sec to 300sec. I suspect this "started failing" only recently because the tests weren't being run before on codecoverage (which IIRC [~mikesbrown] discovered not too long ago and fixed).

    IMPALA-3790: Fix admission control flaky stress test
    
    In addition to a previous change which extended the
    admission control test timeouts for code coverage jobs, the
    tests with high concurrency are still experiencing timeouts
    in the admission control queues (which is different from the
    timeouts that were set on the test cases). Rather than
    extend the timeouts on the queues as well (which would
    increase the already ridiculously long test time ~2hrs),
    this limits the number of concurrent queries that are
    submitted with code coverage.
