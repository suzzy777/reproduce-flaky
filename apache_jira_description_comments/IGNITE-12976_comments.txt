Mikhail, thanks for fixing the issue. Could you please add a test the will ensure the problem won't arise in the future?

Hi Denis, thanks for the quick review. Sure, your comment is very reasonable - tests are there now. Cheers!

[~Kostyuckovich], the fix itself looks good. But there is a couple of moments specific to Ignite development process which should be addressed:
# Each test class should be added to a test suite to run in CI. Here you can use https://github.com/apache/ignite/blob/master/modules/spring-data/src/test/java/org/apache/ignite/testsuites/IgniteSpringDataTestSuite.java (and counterparts for different spring-data versions).
# Usually patches should be checked with TC bot (https://mtcga.gridgain.com/), check an [instruction|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/IGNITE/Apache+Ignite+Teamcity+Bot#ApacheIgniteTeamcityBot-HowtocheckaPRwiththeTCBot]. Do not hesitate to ask if something is not clear.
