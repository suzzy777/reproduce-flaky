I've seen this failure twice now, about once every week or two. Usually in the TSAN build:

{noformat}
[ RUN      ] ResettableHeartbeaterTest.TestResetHeartbeats

I0812 07:40:38.169567 20465 test_util.cc:50] Had fatal failures, leaving test files at /data1/test-tmp/ResettableHeartbeaterTest.TestResetHeartbeats.1407854438045003-20465
[  FAILED  ] ResettableHeartbeaterTest.TestResetHeartbeats (125 ms)
{noformat}

The test in question creates a resettable heartbeater with period x and runs the following code in a loop:
1. Sleep for x/4.
2. Reset the heartbeater.
3. Assert that the heartbeater didn't run the heartbeat function.

Most of the time, this works fine. There's no guarantee, though, that the sleep won't take longer than x/4. Between that and the fact that the period of the heartbeater and the period of the test thread aren't synchronized, it's easy to see how the heartbeater may call the heartbeat function. And that's what's going on here.

Mike, we talked about this a few week ago. I'd assign it to David except he's away at the moment.
