I have been struggling with this for some time (due to my lack of knowledge about C compiler error messages) and finally found a way to make it compile. The problem is that Zookeeper defines a function `htonll` that is a builtin function in Yosemite. For me it worked to just remove this function, but as it needs to keep working on other systems as well, we would need some check for the OS version or if the function is already defined.
