It looks like the region is online but not in the online region list yet.  That's because we do the zk transition to open before put it in the online region list.

The issue is that we transition the znode to OPEN, then put the region in online region list of the region server.  If unlucky (or due to thread scheduling since for unit test all nodes run in one JVM), it is likely the region is opened already in master, but it is not in the online region list of the region server yet.

Close it as a duplicate since the root case is the same as HBASE-8940.

Reopen it, let's fix the test instead, for now.

+1

Here is an addition that does a get on each region in the list of online regions.  It will retry until region is fully online.

It is crass.  May be should be done in //.

Hmm...  I don't think this patch right.   Let me look at it again.

I think this issue likely fixed by "HBASE-8934 Fix bunch of flaky tests ADDENDUM patch that fixes imports"

This patch adds even  more insurance.  It uses Canary to do a get against all regions before we proceed with the test.  This is OTT but it will make sure all regions are for sure online before test starts (not just assigned and the table 'enabled').

I measured how long the test takes and seems no extra cost though I can imagine if big table using this method, there could be slow down.

I had to mess around in Canary so it could be useable by a client.  It was also broke in that we no longer let you do a Get with an empty row.

Let me commit this.  Another TestAccessController test just failed in same way.  Will fix javadoc before commit.

http://54.241.6.143/job/HBase-0.95/622/org.apache.hbase$hbase-server/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.access/TestAccessController/testPostGrantRevoke/ is the build that just failed.

Applied to trunk and 0.95.  Will leave open for now to see if this actually takes care of the issue we've been seeing.

Resovling.  Haven't seen this fail since.
