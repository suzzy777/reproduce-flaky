The issue has been located. In zeppelin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/socket/ConnectionManager.java there is the following problem code:

```

public void broadcastNoteListExcept(List<NoteInfo> notesInfo,
 AuthenticationInfo subject) {
 Set<String> userAndRoles;
 for (String user : userSocketMap.keySet()) {
 if (subject.getUser().equals(user)) {
 continue;
 }
 //reloaded already above; parameter - false
 userAndRoles = authorizationService.getRoles(user);
 userAndRoles.add(user);
 // TODO(zjffdu) is it ok for comment the following line ?
 // notesInfo = generateNotesInfo(false, new AuthenticationInfo(user), userAndRoles);
 multicastToUser(user, new Message(Message.OP.NOTES_INFO).put("notes", notesInfo));
 }
 }

```

Because the commented out line is not called or the equivalent, the new note list is that of the latest user to have the note list broadcast.  That is, if User A adds a note, all other users will see User A's list regardless of their own permissions.

 

This is an outcome of the change associated with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3735 ; [https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3151] .

 

Thanks for the investigation, [~jhammel] Do you mind to create a PR for it ?

A PR will be created when there is working and tested code.  Still investigating.  I plan on making a PR vs branch-0.9.

Thanks [~jhammel] Looking forward your PR

[~zjffdu] is there any progress on this? Certainly this is a huge security bug in the application. I'm able to reproduce this as well.

These are the steps that I also used to confirm that this is visible through websockets when using developer tools in Chrome and to see it in my Zeppelin homepage:
 # Open developer tools in chrome
 # Click on the "Network" tab > WS
 # Refresh the user's Zeppelin homepage
 # Select the websocket and click on the tab "Messages"
 # On a separate browser create a new note using a different user. This new note will automatically show up in your Zeppelin homepage along with the other user's notes. There is no need for you to refresh your browser.
 # Go back to developer tools in chrome, and now inspect the Messages section. Look for "NOTES_INFO" and then expand the "data" section.
