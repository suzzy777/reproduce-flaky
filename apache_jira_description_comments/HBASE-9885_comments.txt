v1 was built on 0.96. Hopefully it works on trunk.
It includes a fix for HBASE-9880.

mvn test -Dtest=TestHRegion#testParallelAppendWithMemStoreFlush is flaky here, I'm looking into it.

The fast path of using the .96 patch on trunk didn't work... But the guilty for the flaky TestHRegion#testParallelAppendWithMemStoreFlush is found: it's HBASE-9855

+1 Thanks for fixing my breakage of 0.96 build.

Name these something else on commit:

EMPTY_RESULTP;

This?

EMPTY_RESULT_PB?



Ok for the renaming.
Is TestHRegionBusyWait known as flaky, or should I investigate for this one before committing? (I'm running the test locally, on 0.96. it seems ok so far).

Retry.  I've not noticed it being flakey. 

Retrying

It failed in HBASE-9886 as well, so I think it's not coming from this patch. May be it's HBASE-9855 as well?

It fails locally as well, 25% of the time.

On the good news side, when I run YCSB with 8 clients on a 3 nodes cluster, I don't have any major GC. If I run the same test w/ the 0.96.0, I've got ~3 per minute...


You think it HBASE-9855?

For TestHRegion, yes, I've run the tests against different commits and HBASE-9855 appeared as the guilty. For TestHRegionBusyWait I'm going to test.

Running org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestHRegionBusyWait locally against 0.96, it does not fail for me.  Let me try TestHRegion.  Will back it out if causing failures.  It passed twice over on the issue.

My test is still running, but 0.96 failed here, while I've ran 7 iterations on the pre-HBASE-9855 commit w/o issue so far.

It does not fail for me locally on 0.96.  Let me back it out though since you have been able to finger it as culprit.

funny, it failed at the 12th attempt on af3c7c8e208822f443cbf0e69ccea50f8c7ae1fe
Failed tests:   testParallelIncrementWithMemStoreFlush(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.TestHRegionBusyWait): expected:<2000> but was:<1998>



Do you mean HBASE-9855?  It has nothing to do w/ HRegions in it.

fbfbbbada6cbba006503f29561378cef35139ad4 ran ok for 40 tries, so the guilty is in the middle. 

May be: HBASE-9868 Remove some array copy, especially around protobuf :-)

But that is a good one!

I can't repro the fail local.  Let me try different another platform.

All this could be attributed to the usual flakiness. I think I'm going to commit the last version. Someone disagrees?

+1 on commit to 0.96 and trunk.

Committed, thanks for the review, Stack!

SInce the commit, the precommit env bacame flaky and it seems that surefire cannot parse the tests results. Let see if there is a relation by reverting.

Looks like the scope of cells == null condition is too wide: the for loop should be outside 'if (cells == null)' check.

Done. I don't know if it was the cause at the end. But the new patch is better than the previous one.

Released in 0.96.1.  Issue closed.
