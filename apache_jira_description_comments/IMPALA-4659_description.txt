I saw a few tests fail with Memory Limit Exceeded around the same time on an exhaustive test run: TestHdfsQueries.test_analytic_fns, TestScratchLimit.test_without_specifying_scratch_limit, TestScannersAllTableFormatsWithLimit.test_limit

They were run concurrently with TestScannersFuzzing. My hypothesis is that some of the instances of the TestScannersFuzzing tests used too much memory and caused the other tests to fail. We should set a query mem_limit on those tests to avoid this happening.
