I took [~spmallette] groovy code and turned it into a tool we can run in CI.

nice! i'm glad that ended up being of some use.

Yeah, worked very well for reviewing CASSANDRA-15909, so looking to produce a gold set of metrics and add tests to guard against removing of metrics or changing types (adding is ok).

One thing I did notice, so would need to think about in terms of CI, is that Stages didn't match in the test clusters, seems one had migration and the other had read... this is a problem for CI as it would cause flaky tests, so would need to figure out solution (maybe do a few read/write with schema changes to stabilize).

interesting. I think that ultimately some sort of workload needs to be executed prior to doing the jmx tests to make sure that all the metrics are actually initialized. iirc there were definitely a few that were documented that i never managed to see anywhere. 

[~Bereng] was hoping you could take a look at the changes to ToolRunner in the PR?  ToolRunner tried to read stdout and stderr in the same thread which caused a dead lock.  stdout and stderr are normally bounded queues so when full the publisher is blocked waiting on the consumer, the tests were reading stderr (which never closed) before stdout which caused stdout to fill up and block the forked process.  To work around this, stdout and stderr are handled by their own thread.  Also, the buffer wasn't shared in a safe way so changed how tests access the stdout and stderr buffers

[~spmallette] if you could would love your feedback as well, I mostly took your work and ran with it.

[~dcapwell] nice to see {{ToolRunner}} is being used. I dropped some comments in the PR. Also CI looks like it's reporting some error you'd like to look into.

Thanks for the review [~Bereng].  

bq. I dropped some comments in the PR

replied to or fixed all comments.

I never run eclipse warnings locally so didn't see this, sorry for asking for a review of a build that fails!  Fixed the issue (and will try to add from now on)

> would love your feedback as well,

I have no additional thoughts on this one. i'll just say again that i'm stoked that you were able to convert my little script into something useful!

bq. sorry for asking for a review of a build that fails

No need to apologize! np. Thanks for your comments. I am going crazy with a flaky atm but I will try to finish the review of this one later as I had focused on {{ToolRunner}} only so far.

[~dcapwell] apologies for the late reply as I was OOO on Friday. PR lgtm assuming CI is good. I would move the ToolRunner POC out of this ticket into CASSANDRA-15591 +1

bq.  I would move the ToolRunner POC out of this ticket 

Sounds good, was too lazy to create another branch =)x

[~dcapwell] I left a couple extra comments. 1 is cosmetic-ish. The one on {{onComplete}} is the only loose end to me. Assuming that is resolved I am +1 on the PR.

+1d this on the GitHub PR a while ago, but forgot to record it here.

going to start the commit, but think I need to rebase as [~maedhroz] changed 2 4.0 metrics names.
