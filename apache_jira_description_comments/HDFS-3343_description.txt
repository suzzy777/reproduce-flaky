Similar to HDFS-3170 on the write side, we should improve the metrics that are generated on the DN for read latency. We should have separate metrics for the time spent in {{transferTo}} vs {{waitWritable}} so that it's easy to distinguish slow local disks from slow readers on the other end of the socket.
