Well, since every query has an {{ORDER BY}} clause, it is not a good idea, to add an extra sorting :)

The test file is added by HIVE-16448.
[~mmccline], [~gopalv]: Could you please check if it is enough to change every {{ORDER BY a asc}} with {{ORDER BY a asc, b asc}}, and regenerate the golden files?

Thanks,
Peter

I think the rule of thumb is if the query has a LIMIT clause you need to add an ORDER BY clause so the correct N rows are chosen.  Otherwise,  adding SORT_QUERY_RESULTS should do the trick.

[~mmccline], the vector_order_null query file is added by HIVE-16448, and the only problem with that the source data is:
{code}
insert into src_null values (1, 'A');
insert into src_null values (null, null);
insert into src_null values (3, null);
insert into src_null values (2, null);
insert into src_null values (2, 'A');
insert into src_null values (2, 'B');
{code}

And the results are only ordered by a column, and not by b, so as I see both results are valid:
{code}
NULL	NULL
1	A
2	B
2	A
2	NULL
3	NULL
{code}
or
{code}
NULL	NULL
1	A
2	A
2	B
2	NULL
3	NULL
{code}

What do you think?

Thanks,
Peter

It is easier to create the patch, than describe :)

I'm lost.  Can't we just add the SORT_QUERY_RESULTS?  Will not that stabilize this test?

Hi [~mmccline],

Judging from the test name, the queries and the jira, I think the test aims to test the order by clause. So if we add the SORT_QUERY_RESULTS then we defeat the original intention of the test.

I was asking you, because the IDEA Annotate tells me, you were the one who added this test with HIVE-16448 :)

Thanks,
Peter

Cleaned up test files...

There were test infra problems, so the tests did not run

This failed test is a known flaky, see:

Any comments [~mmccline]?

Thanks,
