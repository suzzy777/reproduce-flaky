    could you add tests for this?

    Looks great to me, @bustios could you add a simple test case that reproduce this case to the [python/src/test/java/org/apache/zeppelin/python/PythonInterpreterPandasSqlTest.java](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/python/src/test/java/org/apache/zeppelin/python/PythonInterpreterPandasSqlTest.java) ?

    Tranks for the revision @felixcheung, @bzz. I have already added the test case. 
    
    I think it would be nice to show a column with the row number or index if the DataFrame had one.

    @bustios This makes sense, please feel free to open a separate JIRA issue for such improvement. We just need to make sure that it's clearly distinguished and can not be confused by the user as a part of the dataset.
    
    CI failure is due to flaky R integration tests, which are not related
    ```
    Results :
    
    Failed tests: 
      ZeppelinSparkClusterTest.sparkRTest:116 expected:<[[1] 3]> but was:<[<pre><code>Error in getSparkSession(): SparkSession not initialized
    </code></pre>
    
    <pre><code>Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable) : unable to find an inherited method for function 'count' for signature '&quot;function&quot;'
    </code></pre>]>
    
    Tests run: 65, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
    ```
    
    Merging if there is no further discussion.
