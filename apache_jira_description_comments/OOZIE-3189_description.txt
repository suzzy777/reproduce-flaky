Apache has updated it's policy on the release signatures, as per it's website [here|https://www.apache.org/dev/release-distribution#sigs-and-sums] and a recent email. Basically, all future releases should be providing a sha512 checksum instead of an md5 one.

There are two tasks:
 # Update the release script to use sha512 instead of md5
 [https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/bin/create-release-artifact#L71]
 [https://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#sha-checksum]
 # Update the wiki (requires committer/pmc permissions?)
 [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOZIE/How+To+Release]

While we're updating the wiki, we should add details on:
 # Making sure the gpg key used for signing releases is 4096 bit RSA
 # Publishing your gpg public key to a key server ([https://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#keyserver])
