I noticed flakiness in {{TabletHistoryGcITest.TestSnapshotScanBeforeAHM}}, where failures manifested themselves with the following error:
{noformat}
src/kudu/integration-tests/tablet_history_gc-itest.cc:172
Failed
Bad status: Invalid argument: snapshot scan end timestamp is earlier than the ancient history mark. Consider increasing the value of the configuration parameter --tablet_history_max_age_sec. Snapshot timestamp: P: 1669591267778185 usec, L: 0 Ancient History Mark: P: 1669591267778244 usec, L: 0 Physical time difference: -0.000s
{noformat}

It turned out the root case of the flakiness was not-yet-updated extra configuration for a tablet when scan request at snapshot arrived.

Setting the number of replicas to one for the test table addressed the issue.

It's necessary to fix the issue with {{IsAlterTableDone}}.  I guess there is a bug affecting not only setting the extra configurations for a table, but other DDL-related properties as well.
