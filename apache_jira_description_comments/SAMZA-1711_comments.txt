    SAMZA-1711: Re-enable existing standalone integration tests.

    **Changes:**
    
    * Enable all existing standalone integration tests except `TestZkStreamProcessorSession`(`TestZkStreamProcessorSession` is flaky. It spawns `x` StreamProcessors and kills one StreamProcessor through zookeeper session expiration. Sleeps for 5 seconds and proceeds to do validation. If the rebalancing phase takes longer the sleep time, validation fails).
    * Remove zookeeper unavailable unit test from LocalApplicationRunner(Race condition in zookeeper shutdown fails other tests). The deleted test will be added back in a separate test class.
    * Increase zookeeper server minimum session timeout from 6 seconds to 120 seconds.
    * Add assertions to validate if kafka topics setup were successful before the unit tests.
    
    **Validation:** 
    
    Verified by running the following script on top of this patch.
    
    ```bash
    i=0
    while [ $i -lt 50 ]; do
        i=`expr $i + 1`
        echo "Run " +$i 
        ./gradlew clean :samza-test:test -Dtest.single="TestZkLocalApplicationRunner" --debug --stacktrace >> ~/test-logs_10
        ./gradlew clean :samza-test:test -Dtest.single="TestZkStreamProcessor" --debug --stacktrace >> ~/test-logs_10
        ./gradlew clean :samza-test:test -Dtest.single="TestStreamProcessor" --debug --stacktrace >> ~/test-logs_10
        ./gradlew clean :samza-test:test -Dtest.single="TestZkStreamProcessorFailures" --debug --stacktrace >> ~/test-logs_10
    done;
    ```
    
    
    **Result:**
    
    ```bash
    [svenkata@svenkata-ld2 samza]$ grep 'BUILD SUCCESS' ~/test-logs_10  | wc -l 
    200
    [svenkata@svenkata-ld2 samza]$ grep 'BUILD FAIL' ~/test-logs_10  | wc -l 
    0
    ```

    SAMZA-1692: Standalone stability fixes.
    
    - Currently, on session expiration processorListener with incorrect generationId is registered with zookeeper(ZkUtils generationId is incremented on reconnect but the generationId in processorListener is zero all the time). When a session reconnect happens to a processor successive to leader, leader expiration event will be skipped. This will prevent leader re-election on a current leader death and will stall the processors group. Fix is to reinstantiate and then register processorChangeListener on session expiration.
    - Add processorId to debounce thread name (this can aid debugging when multiple processors are running within a jvm).
    - After ScheduleAfterDebounceTime queue is shutdown, don't accept new schedule requests. Current ZkJobCoordinator shutdown sequence comprise of the following steps
         - Shutdown the ScheduleAfterDebounceTime queue.
         - Stop the zkClient  and relinquish it's resources.
    
    After we shutdown ScheduleAfterDebounceTime and before zkclient is stopped, any new operations can be scheduled in ScheduleAfterDebounceTime queue. This will result in RejectedExecutionException, since executorService is stopped.
    
    ```
