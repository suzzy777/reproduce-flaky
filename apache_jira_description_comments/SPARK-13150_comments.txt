Seems that ADD JAR command in both flaky tests may fail silently and causing the following failure of CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION command. Still investigating.

Please refer to [this PR comment|https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11040#issuecomment-179028394] for the reason of the test failure.

Both flaky tests seem to be caused by SPARK-13157. Ideally, fixing SPARK-13157 should also fix this issue.
