If a dirty page under the checkpoint is found, following is suggested
- copy it to the local thread buffer, 
- and then after performing all actions in region for evicting the page
- finish execution allocatePage()/acquirePage()
- unlock segment to allow other workers to operate
- perform the pwrite() call based on the data from local buffer

Now if page eviction started there is possible drops to 0 put/seconds in case a lot of threads are watiting for same segment lock.
