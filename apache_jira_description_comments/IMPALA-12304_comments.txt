IMPALA-12304: Fix the sequence number issue for update_catalogd RPC

Subscriber will re-register to statestore when statestore is restarted.
When the statestore is restarted, its sending sequence number for
update_catalogd RPC is reset. The subscribers need to reset their last
receiving sequence number of update_catalogd RPC when they successfully
re-register with statestore. Otherwise, subscribers may miss some RPCs
after statestore is restarted.

Could find related error messages in catalogd log file when run
test_catalogd_ha.py::TestCatalogdHA::test_restart_statestore.
Verified that no such error messages in catalogd log after the fix.

Made a small optimization for statestore not to wake up the thread
for update_catalogd RPC if there is no change for elected active
catalogd and there is no RPC failure in last round.

Testing:
 - Passed the core test.

IMPALA-12340: Fix flaky test_two_catalogd_with_force_active

The issue could be re-produced by repeatedly running the test case for
about 50 times in Jenkins or on local machine.
The issue was introduced by IMPALA-12304, for which we tried not to
wake up the thread for update_catalogd RPC if there is no change for
elected active catalogd. Since we cannot hold mutex when calling
SendUpdateCatalogdNotification(), it may cause the notification to the
condition variable not been processed. To fix the issue, revert the
optimization added in IMPALA-12304, and add sleep in
test_two_catalogd_with_force_active.

Testing:
 - Repeatedly ran test_two_catalogd_with_force_active for 8000 times on
   local machine without failure, ran the test for 1000 times in Jenkins
   without failure.
   Repeatedly ran all test cases in test_catalogd_ha.py for 21 hours in
   Jenkins without failure.
 - Passed core test.
