Change the dev-test.sh script.

Let me put it up and see how it does.  The test report may even show flakies.

+1000.

Huge +1, please enable on all Jenkins jobs

Lets see how it does on hadoopqa first, get some feedback, then we can talk about putting everywhere.

Resolving as committed to hadoopqa into ./dev-tools/test-patch.sh.

SUCCESS: Integrated in HBase-TRUNK #5752 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-TRUNK/5752/])
HBASE-12438 Add -Dsurefire.rerunFailingTestsCount=2 to patch build runs so flakies get rerun (stack: rev 6d3339f25ef04431a18e6293e0409647fe888081)
* dev-support/test-patch.sh


Does Hudson report that it has rerun the tests or it just gives us a blue build without any hint of failing tests?

Out of the box, Jenkins doesn't treat flakey tests in a special way, but [there is a plugin|https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Flaky+Test+Handler+Plugin] that can change this. Perhaps worth checking with our friends at b.o.a. to get this set up, [~stack]?
