+1

Overall I am +1, but shall we run upgrade tests just in case?

This too green CI scares me :D 

I am wondering isn't it too early to bump it on trunk? 

Do we want to be consistent and also update README.asc?
 

I wouldn't say its too early, because failing to bump the version is problematic, especially for the pip installable cqlsh maintained on pypi.org.  Updating README.asc is a good idea.

I've triggered the upgrade tests [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/504/workflows/fd7a19a2-4961-4580-96f6-c51ec8515be1/jobs/5888] in the run from above.

bq. I am wondering isn't it too early to bump it on trunk? 

It's early, but I don't know that there's a 'too early' since it needs to happen.

bq. Do we want to be consistent and also update README.asc?

I'll do that on commit.

Fair, my +1 still stands on green upgrade tests, can you trigger also the Java ones, please? Thanks :) 

Those seem to have timed out [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/504/workflows/f6e30d0d-6f34-41d4-a133-995558885430/jobs/5892] but likely not from the cqlsh version changing :)

Another attempt is running [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/504/workflows/e7dbe19c-36c5-4e69-baa5-c394784b8a5e/jobs/5895].

hi [~brandon.williams] 

Any idea why did the test failed ?

I'm not sure but I've changed tack away from circle this time: [!https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/1760/badge/icon!|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Cassandra-devbranch/detail/Cassandra-devbranch/1760/pipeline]

[~e.dimitrova] what should be the next step here?

I am sorry, I thought we are good to commit this one.

I just looked at all runs you linked. So in CircleCI one container was timing out on DropCompactStorage. I think we need to rebase and rerun CI as that test was split lately in another ticket and the patch was not rebased since it was committed more than 20 days ago. WDYT?

PS I am out until next Tuesday but I take a look occasionally at things I am involved in or if there  is something urgent.

Sounds good to me.

[Branch|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra/tree/CASSANDRA-17646], [j8 w/upgrade|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/521/workflows/81f06aa2-3f15-44b9-a890-5667ddda382a], [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/521/workflows/7dd108d5-be12-421c-bc6f-214180be6de2].

There are some failures but for some reason CircleCI hangs there and I can't see them in the UI properly. I noticed that also the upgrade in-jvm tests didn't run.

And because this got already a week old, rebased - 

[https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/pull/new/CASSANDRA-17646]

CI - [j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1731/workflows/14ac9a34-ec2b-439f-b77d-b679ad40230f], [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1731/workflows/d15cc6e7-01ca-47a3-9308-68dbee15d35a]

In regards to this patch things look good to me.

About the failures we observe:

_test_prefer_local_reconnect_on_listen_address_ - CASSANDRA-17700

_utests_system_keyspace_directory_ - CASSANDRA-17489

_testBatchCLShutdownImmediately_ - no ticket but I saw it in Butler so I am going to raise one

_testRemoteStreamFailure_ - no ticket but I found it in Butler so I am going to raise one

_testOutboundConnectionsAreRejectedWhenAuthFails_ - I don't see it in Butler and there is no ticket but I suspect it might be related to CASSANDRA-17618, I will test and follow up. In any way I don't see it related to this patch.

[~brandon.williams] shall we commit this one? Any concerns?

I think we're ready, +1

Added entry to CHANGES.txt and updated the README. Committed, thanks!

The following tickets were opened:

CASSANDRA-17705  - _testBatchCLShutdownImmediately_

CASSANDRA-17706  - _testRemoteStreamFailure_

_testOutboundConnectionsAreRejectedWhenAuthFails_  _-_ it is a newly introduced test in CASSANDRA-17661 last week and it seems it is flaky from the very beginning in two ways - [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/1734/workflows/0875caf9-5b92-4403-a828-881956c011c9/jobs/12044] . I opened CASSANDRA-17708 and pinged the author
