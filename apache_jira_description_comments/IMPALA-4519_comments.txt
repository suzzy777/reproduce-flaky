What was the last commit on the branch?

0ed8efa4653a592aba52359d7fb1f26010a7ab57
which does include the fix for IMPALA-4087, so it may be unrelated.

I don't think this is related to IMPALA-4087, which was a test bug - im IMPALA 4087 it was waiting for num-fragments to reach 1 (which didn't make sense). Here it's waiting for the correct value but it's stuck at 1 - it's probably some kind of query lifecycle bug.

[~henryr] do you have any ideas about what might cause this?

I've seen this happen when a fragment is blocked in {{TransmitData()}}. Because the timeout for sending data is larger than the time the test waits for the number of fragments to hit 0, the test can spuriously fail. 

https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/IMPALA-3977 will fix this once and for all. For now, we could increase the verification timeout to 2.5 minutes.

(There might be something different going on here - this is just a common cause of this problem).

The below patch should hopefully avoid the flakiness. We can reopen if it happens again.

IMPALA-4519: increase timeout in TestFragmentLifecycle

Increase the timeout to over 120s to match datastream_sender_timeout_ms.
This should avoid spurious test failures if we are unlucky and a sender
gets stuck waiting for a receiver fragment that will never start.

Testing:
Ran the test in a loop for a while to flush out any flakiness.

[~tarmstrong] I've seen test_failure_in_prepare failing in gvo's today -- it looks like the commit increases the timeout of test_failure_in_prepare_multi_fragment but not for test_failure_in_prepare which is still failing. Should that be bumped as well?

Re-opening because I've seen this again today.

At first I thought this might be the same issue again, but I suspect it's a different issue with this test so I've opened a different JIRA: IMPALA-4642

We should really add a check at the top of the tests that there are no fragments running.

Yeah, I agree - or a check after the completion of a test/test class (which may be easier to tie then to a faulty test).

This is a bulk comment on all issues with Fix Version 2.8.0 that were resolved on or after 2016-12-09.

2.8.0 was branched on December 9, with only two changes to master cherry-picked to the 2.8.0 release branch after that:

https://github.com/apache/incubator-impala/commits/2.8.0

Issues fixed after December 9 might not be fixed in 2.8.0. If you are the one who marked this issue Resolved, can you check to see if the patch is in 2.8.0 by using the link above? If the patch is not in 2.8.0, can you change the Fix Version to 2.9.0?

Thank you!
