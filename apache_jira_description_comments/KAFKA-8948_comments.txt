Not sure if this was somehow fixed as a side effect of other recent changes, but it passed 90/90 runs on the current trunk so I'm closing this ticket for now

Turns out this was most likely a real issue that just happened to disappear again for some reason – a bug in this system test was discovered to be causing failures after subsequent runs on the same machine since it did not properly clean up after the test. That bug (and most likely also this ticket) should be fixed by [https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7693]
