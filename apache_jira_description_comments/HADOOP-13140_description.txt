{{org.apache.hadoop.fs.GlobalStorageStatistics#put}} is not checking the null scheme, and the internal map will complain NPE. This was reported by a flaky test {{TestFileSystemApplicationHistoryStore}}. Thanks [~brahmareddy] for reporting.

To address this,

# Fix the test by providing a valid URI, e.g. {{file:///}}
# Guard the null scheme in {{GlobalStorageStatistics#put}}
