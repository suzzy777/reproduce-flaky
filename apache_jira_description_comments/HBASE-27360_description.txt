https://ci-hbase.apache.org/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/job/master/4167/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client/TestAsyncTableScanner/testScanWrongColumnFamily_0__table_raw__scan_normal_/

The failure message is kinda unreadable... I guess the problem is we do not wait enough time as the completion of the span can be executed concurrently with normal scan operation.

And also I saw this in the test code

{code}
    // RawAsyncTableImpl never invokes the callback to `onScanMetricsCreated` -- bug?
{code}

This is not a bug as you need to manually enable scan metrics by calling Scan.setScanMetricsEnabled(true).

Let me also fix this.
