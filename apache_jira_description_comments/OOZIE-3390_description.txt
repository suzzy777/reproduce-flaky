Shell action's stderr contains an error message about path.
I executed shell action example to test Oozie 5.1 rc1, the job finished with success, but stderr of the job contained "Path echo doesn't appear to exist".

https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/27e4bf1688a6a7750b9c8454de5021337696fd61/sharelib/oozie/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/ShellContentWriter.java#L91
{code}
                writeLine(errorStream, "Path " + filename + " doesn't appear to exist");
{code}

The problem is that we ignore the PATH of the process.
