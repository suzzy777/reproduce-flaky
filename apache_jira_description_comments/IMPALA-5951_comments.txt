    IMPALA-5951: Remove flaky test_catalogd_timeout
    
    test_catalogd_timeout sets a Kudu operation timeout of 1ms and then
    performs various Kudu operations which it expects to fail due to a
    timeout.
    
    Since the test was written, things have sped up - for example, Impala
    used to create a new Kudu client for each operation, but that was
    changed in IMPALA-5167, such that the operations now occasionally
    complete quickly enough that they don't timeout.
    
    There's not really any way to rewrite this test to ensure that it
    won't be flaky, so the patch removes it.
