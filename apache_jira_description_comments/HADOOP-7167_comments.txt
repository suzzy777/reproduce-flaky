+1 patch looks good. With only exception that we shouldn't overuse this 'facility'

    HADOOP-7167. Allow using a file to exclude certain tests from build. Contributed by Todd Lipcon.


Hi Todd, the exclude file does not work on Cygwin.  Could you take a look?

Hey Nicholas. Really sorry about that! Do you know if there is some equivalent to /dev/null in cygwin? ie a file which is always guaranteed to exist and be empty? I wonder what happens if we just pass an empty parameter to the ant excludeFile tag...

If this is getting in your way, feel free to revert and we can commit a new version that works on both platforms.

Cygwin actually has {{/dev/null}}.  The following works.

{noformat}
$ ls > /dev/null
{noformat}

Interestingly, {{ls}} shows it only if the full path is given.

{noformat}
$ ls -l /dev/null
crw-rw-rw- 1 tsz Users 1, 3 Nov 30  2006 /dev/null

$ ls -l /dev

Hi Todd, have you got a chance to take a look?  In case you don't have time to work on this, could you revert this, HDFS-1731 and MAPREDUCE-2367?  Many thanks.

Yes, sorry - I am planning to add an empty file in "src/test/empty-file" and use that as the default instead of /dev/null. Sound good?

How does this patch look?

The patch works if I create {{src/test/empty-file}} manually.

+1 patch looks good, thanks!
