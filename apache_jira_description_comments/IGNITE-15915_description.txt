Currently, SslStreamFactory can't be configured without specifying client-side certificates. 
This shouldn't be the case - SSL can be used without any certificates on the client.

Workaround:

{code}
class SimpleSslStreamFactory : ISslStreamFactory {
    public SslStream Create(Stream stream, string targetHost)
    {
        var sslStream = new SslStream(stream, false, null, null);
        sslStream.AuthenticateAsClient(targetHost);
        return sslStream;
    }
}
{code}
