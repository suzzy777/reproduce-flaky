IMPALA-4557: Fix flakiness with FLAGS_stress_free_pool_alloc

FLAGS_stress_free_pool_alloc is a gflag for simulating malloc
failure in debug builds. If set, FreePool::Allocate() and
FreePool::Reallocate() will return NULL on every
FLAGS_stress_free_pool_alloc allocations. The problem is that
the counter for tracking number of allocations is updated
racily by multiple threads, leading to non-determinism and
flaky tests. This change fixes the problem by making the counter
an AtomicInt32.
