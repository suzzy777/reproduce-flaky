test/anttasks are compiled with _build-test target.

keepBrief could be simplified not to use a java custom ant task at all. Fix [here|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/commit/10fe617ed01ef4d3d2938571d5c696715ab2ed90]

This is trunk but 4.1 will have the same patch.

Tested locally: 

1) Created tiny testlist.txt (just a few tests) with the following content:

{code:java}
org/apache/cassandra/auth/CassandraAuthorizerTruncatingTest.java
org/apache/cassandra/concurrent/SEPExecutorTest.java
org/apache/cassandra/cql3/CQL3TypeLiteralTest.java
org/apache/cassandra/cql3/QueryEventsTest.java
{code}
 

2) ant testclasslist -Dno-checkstyle=true - prints brief console output 

3) ant testclasslist -Dno-checkstyle=true -Dcassandra.keepBriefBrief=true - prints brief console output

4) ant testclasslist -Dno-checkstyle=true -Dcassandra.keepBriefBrief=false - prints noisy console output


[~adelapena] do you mind to review, please? 

Once the patch is confirmed I will run it through CI with both 4.1 and trunk. 

 

I have tested the following cases:
||Ant command||No args||-Dcassandra.keepBriefBrief=true||-Dcassandra.keepBriefBrief=false||
|ant testclasslist|brief output|brief output|long output|
|ant testsome -Dtest.name=...|long output|brief output|long output|
|ant test|brief output|brief output|long output|

I think that's the expected behaviour. 

It always works as expected if the {{cassandra.keepBriefBrief}} property is specified. However, if the property is not specified there can be slightly surprising cases:
 * A {{testlist.txt}} with a single class will produce a brief output, clashing a bit with the comment on {{{}build.xml{}}}.
 * A call to {{ant testsome -Dtest.name="*est"}} will produce a long output, whereas {{ant testsome -Dtest.name="*Test"}} will produce a brief output.

I think it would be ideal if the default behaviour depended on the number of tests, rather than on the use of the "*Test" expression. But that's an improvement that can be done on a separate ticket. IMO the current patch restores the pre-CASSANDRA-17234 behaviour, +1.
 

By the way, I'm looking at [this branch|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/tree/18267-trunk].

Thanks [~adelapena] . I reran all cases from the table with 4.0 where we still have the old script and one more time confirmed they look the same with the current patch.

 
The test I used for testing with ant testsome is org.apache.cassandra.audit.AuditLoggerAuthTest (known to produce logs as

AuditLogFilterTest doesn't produce output, for example)

Same on 4.0, I suspect testlist.txt was just not considered to be used with one class

Yes, same behavior in 4.0.

Agreed, I will be happy to open a follow up ticket.

Thank you. [~mck], do you agree with the analysis and follow up actions agreed here? Anything else we might be missing? 

bq. do you agree with the analysis and follow up actions agreed here? Anything else we might be missing? 

yes. +1

Reran everything locally also with 4.1 to ensure I did not miss anything.

Pushed CI only JDK11 as it is for sanity check.

Tested also quickly the task works with Java 17 as expected.

CI shows only 1 failure and the console output for unit and in-jvm tests looks as expected.

I opened a ticket for the 4.1 flaky test, seen also in butler - 

CASSANDRA-18047 - Fix flaky paxosRepairHistoryIsntUpdatedInForcedRepair

Also I opened CASSANDRA-18446 - Improve default output behavior when tests are run with ant

I can commit it tomorrow morning if no one has anything else to add

I have also manually tested the patch for 4.1. Nothing else to add, +1
