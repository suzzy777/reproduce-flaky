There are various test failures on the latest main run that need to be fixed after re-enabling the unit tests module. We need to figure out which ones apply to 5.17.x as well and if the test failures are real regressions or just issues with the tests. Also we should re-enable the quick tests mode in 5.17.x as part of this (and scale back some of the tests so it's faster)
