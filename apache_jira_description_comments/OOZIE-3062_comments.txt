Thanks for the contribution [~satishsaley]! Can you put the patch to ReviewBoard?

Uploaded patch on review board. For small patches, I find [Git patch viewer|https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/git-patch-viewer/hkoggakcdopbgnaeeidcmopfekipkleg] (not promoting, just convenient plugin for viewing diff)

env setting is usually separated by , in hadoop configs and not File.pathSeparator. Can you verify?

Thanks [~satishsaley] for the RB link! Posted a review over there.

bq.env setting is usually separated by , in hadoop configs and not File.pathSeparator. Can you verify?
Yes, Hadoop uses comma (,) as separator.

It will be confusing for users to follow different conventions. Created OOZIE-3068

Thanks for the rebased patch [~satishsaley]!

What about the existing functionality in [{{SparkActionExecutor#setupLauncherConf()}}|https://github.com/apache/oozie/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/oozie/action/hadoop/SparkActionExecutor.java#L112-L120], setting {{oozie.launcher.mapred.child.env}} doesn't seem to survive. Is it no longer needed?
