    THRIFT-3306: Java: TBinaryProtocol: Use a single temp byte[] buffer

    Reduces allocations and GC when TBinaryProtocol is allocated repeatedly.
    
    Originally separate byte[] arrays were allocated for each integer type, and
    a separate array for input and output. However, one buffer of the largest
    size (8 bytes for i64) can be used for all purposes.

Happy to share my JMH benchmark code, but here are some results with a small test object containing a few strings, a list of strings, one i64 and one bool.

    Note: the Travis CI build may have failed, but it failed to compile some parts of the C++ code, so I suspect this is due to a flaky test and is not legitimate, since I didn't touch any of the C++ stuff.
