The {{MasterAllocatorTest.SlaveLost}} takes more that {{5s}} to complete. A brief look into the code hints that the stopped agent does not quit immediately (and hence its resources are not released by the allocator) because [it waits for the executor to terminate|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/src/tests/master_allocator_tests.cpp#L717]. {{5s}} timeout comes from {{EXECUTOR_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_PERIOD}} agent constant.

Possible solutions:
* Do not wait until the stopped agent quits (can be flaky, needs deeper analysis).
* Decrease the agent's {{executor_shutdown_grace_period}} flag.
* Terminate the executor faster (this may require some refactoring since the executor driver is created in the {{TestContainerizer}} and we do not have direct access to it.
