Currently we apply a blacklist to filter the output of the BeeLine Qtest runs.
It might be a good idea to go thorough of the possibilities and find a better way, if possible.

I think our main goal could be for the TestBeeLineDriver test output to match the TestCliDriver output of the came query file. Or if it is not possible, then at least a similar one
