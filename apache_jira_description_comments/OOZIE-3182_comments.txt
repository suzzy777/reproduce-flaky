Thanks for the contribution [~alishap]! Can we have modifications that:
# preserve [*the {{.properties}} file format*|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties] regarding comments (lines beginning either with {{#}} or {{!}})
# modify the RAT license format [*only in compatible ways*|http://creadur.apache.org/rat/apache-rat-plugin/examples/custom-license.html]

Can you please also add checkstyle output before and after the fix?
