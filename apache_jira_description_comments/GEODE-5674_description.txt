Our tests currently use AvailablePortHelper and AvailablePort to find a random port that is not in use.

However, this can lead to port collisions because after the port is returned, it is available until something binds to that socket. In the mean time, other calls to getAvailablePort can return the same port, with around 0.01% chance, since the range is 10000 ports.

If we did not pick ports randomly, but instead iterated over a pool of ports, we would not return the same port twice until exhaust the pool. We therefore not get the same port twice in a test.

We would need to handle the fact that dunit tests have multiple VMs, so we need either a central available port service or a unique pool of ports for each process or something like that.
