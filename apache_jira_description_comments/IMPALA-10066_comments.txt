Saw this here: [https://jenkins.impala.io/job/ubuntu-16.04-from-scratch/11614/testReport/junit/shell.test_shell_interactive/TestImpalaShellInteractive/test_cancellation_mid_command_table_format_and_file_extension____parquet_____parq_____protocol__hs2_/]

An ugly and quick fix for the issue: [https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/16325/]

But I think it needs some further investigation.

HI, 

The problem is occurring because there is a delay between sending the "quit;" and the wait command.
Here is my solution: https://gerrit.cloudera.org/#/c/16322/ 
This should fix the problem.

[~gaborkaszab] [~boroknagyz] it looks like we had a fix that got abandoned. Any idea what happened here?

Hey [~tarmstrong],
As far as I know that was abandoned on the last day for [~tadam] at Cloudera. I wonder if there was any other reason abandoning that patch.
As I see there is a failing verify job on the review but the link is no longer valid. Let me revive the review and re-run a verify job to see what fails.

Seems like the test failed in precommit, which is not a good sign.

I thought this test fails because the SIGINTs are not synchronized, I did some testing and after waiting for the SIGINT to return from the OS got 100/100 test pass, before it was around 97/100.

I will do a bit larger test later, just wanted to ask if I should continue working on the old gerrit change or open a new one?

Thanks for the good news, [~tmate]! You can open a new one if that is more convenient for you. It's up to you which option you choose.

I'm  increasing the priority of this item, as it caused multiple pre-commit failures in the last couple of days.
IMO it should either be fixed, or XFAILed temporarily, until a proper fix can be committed for it.

IMPALA-10066: Fix test_cancellation_mid_command flakiness

This change adds additional synchronisation to fix the flaky test. The
test failures were happening because the test did not wait for the
output of the SIGINT (^C) to arrive. When this was delayed it cluttered
the impala-shell output and other expect calls could fail.

Testing:
 - executed the test locally 250 times without failures, without this
 fix there were about 3 failures in a 100 execution
