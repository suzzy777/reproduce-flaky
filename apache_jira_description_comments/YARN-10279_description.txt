In CS UserGroupMappingPlacementRule andÂ AppNameMappingPlacementRule classes we create new instances of QueueMappingEntity class. In some cases we simply copy the already received class, so we just duplicate it, which is unnecessary since the class is immutable.

This is just a minor improvement, probably doesn't have much impact, but still puts some unnecessary load on GC.
