In some High Availability environments, when an SSH action's {{SshActionExecutor#start()}} runs on another node than {{SshActionExecutor#check()}}, it can happen that due to network bandwidth reasons calling {{Process#exitValue()}} is not enough - but calling {{Process#waitFor()}} is better.

Also, for better error root cause analysis, enhance logging along {{SshActionExecutor}} for the critical parts.
