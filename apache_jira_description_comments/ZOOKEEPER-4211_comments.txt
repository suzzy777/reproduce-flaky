+1, [~liwang].  Easier quota monitoring would be very useful!

Hi, 

I have the patch for this feature and I will submit PRs against master and branch-3.7.

PR submitted and all the checks passed.  Can someone help reviewing it? We would like to get this into 3.7 release to leverage the quota enforcement feature. Thanks.

[~ztzg] do you know what would be the next step for getting this into 3.7 release? Thanks.

Hello [~liwang],

Sorry for the lag; things have been a bit frantic on other fronts.  I will review your contribution ASAP.  It might not get into 3.7.0, as we currently have a release candidate which is being voted on, but I will consider it for 3.7.1 and {{master}}.

Awesome, Damien!  Thanks.

Hi Damien,

Thanks for your comments. I have responded the PR with changes and comments.  There are a couple of points   I would like to to discuss with you to see  if we can come to some resolutions. Would you mind reviewing the comments and the updated PR?

Thanks,

Li

Hi [~liwang],

(I know the other points are still pending.)


Hi Damien,

I have updated PR with the changes for https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/1644#discussion_r605547937

In regarding to https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/1644#discussion_r605548947, I am glad that we are on the same page now.

Hi Damien,

Would you mind responding to the other pending points when you get chance, so we make progress on the PR submission?

Thanks,

Based on investigation result of the performance impact of Prometheus Summary quantile computation,  I am working on adding the support for CounterSet for the use case that need to group counter metrics by keys (i.e. top namespace) but no need for quantiles and sum.  

Hi [~liwang],

Ha, funny; I just caught up with your discussion on the {{dev}} mailing list!  (https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/zookeeper-dev/202105.mbox/browser).  Excellent work, btw.

I haven't forgotten about your points, but have just been really busy on other topics.  (Of course, don't hesitate to ping other reviewers, particularly when I am lagging!)

That being said:

bq. Based on investigation result of the performance impact of Prometheus Summary quantile computation, I am working on adding the support for CounterSet for the use case that need to group counter metrics by keys (i.e. top namespace) but no need for quantiles and sum.

I figure we'll have to use some sort of queue to gather all these metrics without blocking the worker threads, but +1 on not making things worse in the meantime :)

Hi [~ztzg]

I figure you must be busy with other things. :)I should have the patch/changes for supporting the CounterSet ready soon. Hope you will have some time for it, so we can discuss and address any pending points and merge the PR. If not, please let me know and I will ping other committers.

Yes, totally agree. Using CounterSet instead of SummarySet for metrics such as QuotaExceededCountPerNamespace will avoid unnecessary computation and memory overhead.  It helps even after we change the metrics gathering to async operation.





The PR has been updated with the support of CounterSet. [~ztzg],  can you or someone else review it? Thanks, Li.

Hi [~liwang],

Yup, I have seen your update.  Planning to have a look tomorrow.

Cheers, -D

Awesome, thanks Damien.

Hi Damien,

Can you please take a look the test part of the PR?

We are planning to upgrade to 3.7 and enable the quota enforcement. feature. It would be very helpful if the changes can be merged.

Thanks,

Li



Hi [~liwang],

I am planning to dedicate some time to this on Wednesday.

HTH, -D

Awesome, thanks a lot! [~ztzg]
