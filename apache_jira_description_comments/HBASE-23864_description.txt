Now even the split/merge is disabled, master will submit a SplitTableRegionProcedure, too. And rollback it when execute failed. I thought the split/merge switch is a cluster level swtich. Master can check it early and no need to submitÂ SplitTableRegionProcedure/MergeTableRegionsProcedure when split/merge switch is disabled.
