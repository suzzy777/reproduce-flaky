QPIDJMS-292: ensure credit handling accounts for buffered messages correctly to prevent prefetching more than the expected number of messages

NO-JIRA: make test pass with Qpid JMS 0.23

Qpid JMS 0.23 changed its prefetch behaviour (QPIDJMS-292).
The test remains flaky because it is up to the client to decide when to issue more credit.
