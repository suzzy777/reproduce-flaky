    ok a couple of things to open JIRA for?
    - SparkR app id
    - disabled tests
    - move livy interpreter export to interpreter.sh
    
    looks good otherwise

    I think it is flaky test as this PR only change the code of livy interpreter, didn't touch other components of zeppelin. And I believe I see this flaky test before.
