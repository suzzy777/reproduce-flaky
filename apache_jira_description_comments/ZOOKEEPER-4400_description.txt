We have three(3) node zookeeper cluster running as a pod on Kubernetes cluster,
 Zookeeper version is 3.6.2,we are implementing graceful termination in our zookeeper development through 
 *terminationGracePeriodSeconds:*

*refer link:  [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/*]

When we delete pods then kuberentes sends SIGTERM signal and wait for graceful termination(*terminationGracePeriodSeconds=30)* time before forceful deletion, then service should catch this signal(sigterm) and should shutdown gracefully within 30 seconds. 

 But  zookeeper  doesn't seems to be handling this sigterm and not terminating gracefully terminated without graceful.

Trying deleting the pod

 
{code:java}
 kubectl delete pod/test-zk-0 -n test
{code}
 
{code:java}
kubectl log -f pod/test-zk-0 -n test

zookeeper not terminating gracefully when we delete the pod not logs of zookeeper shutdown coming and immediately pod get deleted.

 

Expectation: Zookeeper must shutdown gracefully when we delete the pod and its evidence should be coming in logs
