The flaky test helper method cause several UT test failing intermittently. For example, the {{TestDFSStripedOutputStreamWithFailure#testAddBlockWhenNoSufficientParityNumOfNodes}} timed out in a recent run (see [exception|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/15158/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hdfs/TestDFSStripedOutputStreamWithFailure/testAddBlockWhenNoSufficientParityNumOfNodes/]), which can be easily reproduced locally.

Debugging at the code, chances are that the helper method is stuck in an infinite loop. We need a fix to make the test robust.
