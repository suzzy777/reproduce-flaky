This looks to be a configuration issue on the host. Is there a valid /etc/master.passwd on the host? Do other cli operations like `id` function?

Host appears okay. 

Reading man getpwnam_r it's not clear to me why ENOENT together with non-zero return code is being returned.

{noformat}
On success, getpwnam_r() and getpwuid_r() return zero, and set *result to pwd.  If no matching password record was found, these functions return 0 and store NULL in *result.  In case of error, an error number is returned, and NULL is stored in *result.
{noformat}

But, later it states it can set ENOENT, which isn't part of the Posix specification as far as I can tell.
{noformat}
ERRORS
       0 or ENOENT or ESRCH or EBADF or EPERM or ...
              The given name or uid was not found.
{noformat}

This thread (http://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2012-December/msg00208.html) seems relevant:

virGetUserIDByName returns an error when the return value of getpwnam_r
is non-0. However on my RHEL system, getpwnam_r returns ENOENT when the
requested user cannot be found, which then causes virGetUserID not
to behave as documented (it returns an error instead of falling back
to parsing the passed-in value as an uid).

Let's fix up os.hpp based on this knowledge?
