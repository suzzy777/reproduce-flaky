    Fix bug

TC results attached.

 

[~vozerov] Can you review the fix please?

[~tledkov-gridgain], could you please take a look?

[~ldz], the fix is OK with me in general.
My comments:
- I think the test for deprecated JDBC driver should be added if the driver code is changed (the {{org.apache.ignite.internal.jdbc,JdbcUtils}} that is is patched. This class is used by old JDBC driver),
- something went wrong with test run. I cannot find results for JDBC. I've run it ([JDBC test run|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/project.html?projectId=IgniteTests24Java8&tab=projectOverview&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F5454%2Fhead]).

[~tledkov-gridgain] Tests added and updated PR.


I try to trigger the JDBC test run manually, but it looks like it's been queued forever.

[~tledkov-gridgain] [~vozerov]

The test run is finished, looks like we have one flaky test JdbcThinTransactionsServerAutoCommitComplexSelfTest.testInsertAndQueryMultipleCaches.

Can you review the PR please?

[~ldz], in general fix looks good. Now we need full Run All [1] to make sure that nothing is broken. Please re-submit for review once it is done.

[1] https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll&branch_IgniteTests24Java8=pull%2F5454%2Fhead&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv

[~vozerov]

The Run All has finished, there's a lot of failed tests in other modules.

Most of them looks flaky to me.

What's the next step here?

[~ldz], please find the list of suspicious failures above. You should went through them and confirm that they are not new comparing to master. Once done please re-submit the ticket for review.

[~vozerov]

I ran the failed test suite again manually.

Please review the results and comment.

[~ldz], not test results look fine, thank you. The last thing which require fixing - imports in tests. We do not allow wildcards ("*"). Please expand imports and re-submit for final review. I will merge you patch then.

[~vozerov]

I have expanded imports.

Please take a look.

[~ldz], I pushed the patch to master. Thank you for contribution.
