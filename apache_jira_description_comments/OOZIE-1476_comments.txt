Instead of reusing the API for coord job kill, I think we should have different API. Also we should allow specifying range of actions to kill (similar to rerun API).

oozie job -kill <jobId> -action 5-20

This will make it extensible and more parameters later on like -date and -appName can be added.





Latest patch attached - 14/Aug. Can review on Reviewboard too

Virag, will add more extensions such as -appName and -action to mean dataset being waited upon as separate enhancement, as it requires more change in querying behavior. This patch reuses the Coord Rerun filtering logic

test failure testSla(org.apache.oozie.client.TestWorkflowClient) is not related and flaky. Fixed the other one in latest patch (v2) and also added twiki doc

The above is due to twiki bullet points. They cannot be split into different lines for proper formatting.

Above cannot be traced back properly.

Committed to trunk. Thanks Virag for review
