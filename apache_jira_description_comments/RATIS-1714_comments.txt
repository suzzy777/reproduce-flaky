[~tison], Have you started?  If not, can work on this.

No :)

Sure, let me do it.

[~tison], I just have pushed https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/755 .  It added unordered async read and changed the FileStore example to use it.

Please see the last commit
- https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/755/commits/2ad403e7021914ee71c75821a35cc86330ca02cb

and ignore the fist two commits, which are for RATIS-1714.

[~szetszwo] The patch looks good to me. Approved.

I'd like to know whether we include this patch in the next 2.x release or only the 3.0 release. I may depend on it to write the application as stated in the mailing list thread.

[~tison], thanks a lot for reviewing the pull request!

Since this new feature only has a small change, we can include it in the next 2.x release.

The pull request is now merged, thanks [~szetszwo] 
[~szetszwo][~tison] Since the number of the next 2.x version has not yet been determined, I temporarily mark the affected version as 3.0.0, which can be changed later

[~liuyaolong], thanks a lot for reviewing and merging this!

Yes, let's merge to branch-2 later.

[~liuyaolong][~szetszwo] perhaps we reopen the issue to be fixed in 2.5.0 and closed when a 2.5.0 or 3.0.0 happened.

But since I'm not the cherry-picker or release manager, it's OK if only we can include this patch in the _next_ release :)

[~tison], there are many JIRAs going to be merged to branch-2.  We will do the merge once 2.4.0 has been released.
