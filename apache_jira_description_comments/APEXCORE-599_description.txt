Observed in the form of flaky unit tests in Beam. The pipelines terminate using shutdown by the operator when there is no more input and occasionally the test will fail because the cluster exits without having processed fully. The bandaid is to have a delay before shutdown is issued, allowing the last tuples to be pushed downstream. See BEAM-1140 for details.
