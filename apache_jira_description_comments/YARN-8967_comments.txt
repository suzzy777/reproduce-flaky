First version of the patch to move the FairScheduler to use the PlacementManager / PlacementRule classes.
This change moves the placement into the RMAppManager and out of the FS. The FS and the CS now behave the same way.

The change is performing placements in the same way as before with two small exceptions:
* the default placement rule is no longer always a terminal rule and takes into account the create flag now
* the nested user rule can now be a terminal rule when the create flags are set
These two changes make all rules behave the same way.

[~sunilg] and [~wangda] could you please look at this change?

Thanks  [~wilfreds], I'm very glad to see that the original YARN-3635 works is finally consumed by FS after 3 years since the JIRA got committed :).

One quick question / comment:

The returned ApplicationPlacementContext should be enough for scheduler to make decision like dynamically create queues, etc. Could you please double check and explain why new methods added to PlacementRule? (cc: [~suma.shivaprasad])

I will leave detailed reviews to others :), and it gonna be better if we can get FS folks to better understand changes in FS. (cc: [~haibochen])

Thank you [~leftnoteasy] It has been a long time since YARN-3635 was added. I looked at moving over a long time ago but saw the impact and pushed it out.

I have extended the {{PlacementRule}} with new methods since the FS uses rules slightly different than the CS. For instance there was no way to cater for nesting of rules in the current setup. In other words I needed a standard way to configure and store the rule that needs to be executed to generate the parent queue name. The FS rules also have a configuration flag included which specifies if the rule can return a dynamic queue or not. The scheduler always has the ability to create a dynamic queue at any point in the hierarchy (below a static or dynamic queue) but the rule contains the switch to allow this or not.
Neither of these options were available in the {{PlacementRule}} and without those there is no way to move the FS rules over.

The {{isTerminal}} method I tried to keep within the FairScheduler code but with the nested rules the fact that the create flag is not always leading I left it in the rule for now. Let me try and move it into the FS policy code where it belongs in the next version of the patch.
I will also look at the checkstyles and test failures and update/fix those.

Updated the patch with fixes for the tests and checkstyle issues.

It also moves the {{isTerminal}} info out of the {{PlacementRule}} into the policy file. Locally all tests now pass.

[~sunilg] can you please have a review of this change?

Hi [~wilfreds], the patch v4 doesn't apply to the trunk. Can you rebase it?

Rebased to trunk, the mockito changes prevented it from being applied.
Diff is basically the same just a 2 line difference in one patch chunk for imports:  [^YARN-8967.005.patch]

After talking off line with a number of people the request was to divide this change into two parts due to its size:
* _part 1_ for the new rules and changes to the existing PlacementRule code
* _part 2_ for the FS changes and integration

It is the only way that the change can be split and make them compile separately. A new jira YARN-9298 is open for _part 1_ and we'll keep this jira for _part 2_. Removing patch available until that one is checked in.

It will also allow work to start on enhancing the rules with filters etc which have existing open jiras.

Waiting until YARN-9298 is checked in before we can re-run the tests.
Uploading a new patch to keep in line with those changes

version 6 of the patch re-uploaded based on the checked in version of YARN-9298

Fixed the newly introduced checkstyle issues. The build should now not have any white space issues anymore.
Test failures are not related to the patch, uploading patch 007.

[~haibochen] or [~templedf] could either of you review this please?

Hi [~wilfreds], thanks for the patch. Some comments:
1. Nice cleanup in class QueueManager.
2. Should we deprecate two constructors of class AllocationFileLoaderService rather than remove them since it is a public class? 
3. "{{public List<PlacementRule> getRules()}}" here, Modifier “public” could be “no modifier” since all test cases invoking method getRules() are in the same package.
4. I would suggest to put the exception into the LOG.warn and remove LOG.debug in method "placeApplication()".
5. The method "addApplication()" is a little bit messy due to it holds both logic for adding a new application and recovered application. I feel like it would be cleaner if we separate the method addApplication to two methods, one for add new application anther for recover applications. Just some thoughts. What do you think?
6. Since we’ve got this, we doesn’t need to check whether queueName is null in method addApplication(). 
{code:java}
if (queueName != null) {
  addApplication(appAddedEvent.getApplicationId(),
      queueName, appAddedEvent.getUser(),
      appAddedEvent.getIsAppRecovering(),
      appAddedEvent.getPlacementContext());
}
{code}
7. Do we still need this check “if (queueName.startsWith(".") || queueName.endsWith(“.”))”? We’ve normalized queue names in placement rule for a new application and the queue name should be valid for a recovered app.

Class {{QueuePlacementPolicy}} related comments:
1. The QueuePlacementPolicy objects in class AllocationConfiguration are never used by production code if we {{updateRules()}} in the constructor. I would suggest either moving  {{updateRules()}} out of the QueuePlacementPolicy constructor or removing all QueuePlacementPolicy objects and making QueuePlacementPolicy a utility class. I prefer the first one since it reduces coupling. In that case, the AllocationConfiguration object still keeps all configurations items including placement rules, which is a consistent behavior.
2. You probably need an another comment style to make this link work {{{@link #getTerminal}}}
3. Incomplete comment {{// The list must be}} in class QueuePlacementPolicy
4. Typos in comment “Builds an QueuePlacementPolicy from an xml element.”  an -> a
5. “testNoCreate()” contains some duplicated test cases. I’m OK if you delete it or not since it isn’t introduced by your patch.
6. I would suggest to refactor the method “fromXml()” a little bit by introducing a new method like “getParentRule()”
7. We could create a nested class like the following in class QueuePlacementPolicy to avoid multiple “get(0)” and “get(1)” in the code. 
{code:java}
  public static class Policy {
    public Object clazzz;
    public String terminal;
}
{code}
8. Find the following code in class SpecifiedPlacementRule, no need to both log error and throw an exception. Would you mind fix it in this patch although it isn’t introduced by this patch?
{code:java}
LOG.error("Specified queue name not valid: '{}'", queueName);
throw new YarnException("Application submitted by user " + user +
    "with illegal queue name '" + queueName + "'.");
{code}

Thank you for the review [~yufeigu]

AllocationFileLoaderService file:
1) yes it did clean up nicely
2) The class is marked as {{@Unstable}} that should cover the change. Leaving the old constructors in could allow you to create a new {{AllocationFileLoaderService}} without a scheduler reference. That would cause a NPE on scheduler init and every single time the reload thread would run, leaving the RM in a failed state. I don't think it would be wise to leave them in.  _Based on all this I do think I need to file a follow up jira to fix the Hive SHIM that uses the policy at the moment and move that to the new code in a backward compatible way._
3) fixed that
4) fixed that
5) The difference between recovery and normal is just two if statements: in the first we ignore and empty context on recovery and the second one is to not generate an event on recovery. Moving the code out would not help. The checks are on opposite sides of the method and simple.
6) We could still have an empty queue that was why I left it. I just noticed that that case would be caught by the {{getLeafQueue}} so we should be OK with removing.
7) fixed that, it should have been removed

QueuePlacementPolicy file:
1) I have chosen to use the utility class solution and clean up a bit more. Keeping the QueuePlacementPolicy around in the allocation does not really help as the rules are really only relevant in the QueuePlacementManager in the new setup. There is no logic beside the rule list which is not 1:1 with the config that we could keep around.
2) fixed the reference (I used javadoc as there was nothing for other comments, now it is just a plain comment)
3) removed the comment and code
4) fixed
5) the tests look really similar but they are not. They test slight variations: the first two checks make sure the specified rule and create user rule trigger correctly. The last two make sure that the specified rule triggers but not the user rule and that the default rule does the catch it correctly.
6) fixed that, I left it at first with a view on possible extension later with other bits. I now moved the parent create code out and left the loop for elements which clears things up.
7) added a RuleMap class based on the suggestion
8) I think it is better to file a follow up jira as the same has happened in all new rule classes. We must have overlooked them in the previous jira when we did the cleanup. I checked and the exception is logged in the client service so it can be done.

Hi [~wilfreds], the patch v9 looks really good. 
{quote}
Based on all this I do think I need to file a follow up jira to fix the Hive SHIM that uses the policy at the moment and move that to the new code in a backward compatible way.
{quote}
I am with you.

Some nits:
1. Sorry to miss this in last review, there is no need to add a debug log since we throw an exception here.
{code}
LOG.debug("Initialising rule set failed", ioe);
throw new AllocationConfigurationException(
    "Rule initialisation failed with exception", ioe);
{code}
3. Too many nested if/for statements in the method fromXml(). It would be nice to exact some logic in the loop to a separated method or we can use the {{if (! node instanceof Element) continue;}} to avoid one layer.
4. I made up a new test case, the “nestedUserQueue” has 2 parents, only the second one takes effect. I believe we should at least LOG a warn for the first parent “primaryGroup” and we don’t need to create and initialize it since it will be overwritten by the second parent. 
{code}
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
sb.append("<queuePlacementPolicy>");
sb.append("  <rule name='specified' />");
sb.append("  <rule name='nestedUserQueue'>");
sb.append("       <rule name='primaryGroup'/>");
sb.append("       <rule name='default'/>");
sb.append("  </rule>");
sb.append("</queuePlacementPolicy>");

createPolicy(sb.toString());
{code}
5. Not a fan of the getters in the nested class RuleMap. It could be as simple as possible as a wrapper class for multiple values, just like the case class in Scala or data class in Kotlin. This is just my preference. I’m OK with current implement though.



1) I missed that one too, fixed now
3) The two for loops run over different lists. Take this example:
{code}
<queuePlacementPolicy>
  <rule name='specified' />
  <rule name='nestedUserQueue'>
       <rule name='primaryGroup'/>
  </rule>
</queuePlacementPolicy>
{code}
The first for loop run over the top level list of nodes (entries: specified and nestedQueue). The second loop runs over the children of each entry in that list. You cannot see the children of the top level nodes until you call {{getChildren()}} on it. For that you need to cast the Node to an Element. I thus cannot collapse the loop into one loop. The list also does not have an iterator to change it to a for-each construct. The xml files also return child Nodes that are not of the Element type for a correct configuration which means we have to filter while traversing the list.
4) I added the same test case. We now handle that case and having no parent rule for the nestedUserQueue correctly.
I have great difficulty removing the create and init for the first rule as I don't know at the point that I find the first rule that I am going to find a second one. I would need to wait until after the loop to create/init which makes the code even more complex.
5) I had that to start with and changed it because the IDE kept complaining. Not sure why but it works now without complaints and without the getter methods. I might have had slightly different access modifiers. Looks far more like a wrapper class now.

I also found that we do not correctly test and handle the cases which have entries which are not _rules_. I updated the test cases and found that we had a possible NPE due to the way we process the policy. These ones are covered in {{testBrokenRules()}} and the updated tests in {{testNestedUserQueueParsingErrors()}}

Junit test failure is not related.
The checkstyle is from this patch but it makes the internal class RuleMap so much simpler that I propose we leave it like it is. [~yufeigu]: the checkstyle was why I introduced the getters etc which is the basis for your comment number 5) before.

Hi [~wilfreds], thanks for the patch.
3) Yeah, the xml DOM looks like a little bit silly. getChildNodes() at least should provide an option to return only elements rather than childs mixed with elements and texts. I believe some new libs should solve this issue. We could do something like this to hide second loop in a method getParentNode(). 
{code}
        Element parentNode = getParentNode(node.getChildNodes());
        PlacementRule parentRule = getParentRule(parentNode, fs);
 {code}
4) That's nice.
5) I do think the current solution is better. Let's ignore this checkstyle warning. Just one concern, can we make both member in class RuleMap “final”? So that no code can change their value except the constructor.

3) I need two pieces back from the child when we have a rule so that is what was hampering the simple move. I was also hesitant because of the possibility to add new child nodes, beside the parent rule, specifically for introducing filters on some of the rules. I think the use of a method for just retrieving the element is simple enough and does not hamper the changes I have been looking at.

5) yes they should have been private and final

Updated the patch with the two changes [^YARN-8967.011.patch]
