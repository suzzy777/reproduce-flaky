The original HiveServer2 patch included support for this. I believe it was removed at a later point (not sure why). You can probably resurrect most of the code by looking at the Git history.

Thanks [~cwsteinbach] for the info!

I have seen in HIVE-14443 - "Improve ide&testing support", that the BeeLine driver was disabled at the time. Since the BeeLine is the official client at the moment, I think it would be good to have it reenabled, and running again.
I have created a series of patches to address the issues:
- HIVE-14459 TestBeeLineDriver - migration and re-enable
- HIVE-16127 Separate database initialization from actual query run in TestBeeLineDriver
- HIVE-16146 If possible find a better way to filter the TestBeeLineDriver output
- HIVE-16152 TestBeeLineDriver logging improvements
- HIVE-16242 Run BeeLine tests parallel

I have several more in my mind after the ones above are committed:
- Create a transformer method to run CLI .q files on BeeLine without changing the .q, and .q.out files - This I might have to separate into multiple changes in case it proves to be more difficult
- Create multiple BeeLine driver versions to match the CLI driver versions (Negative, Compare, HBase)
- Make it possible to run the BeeLine tests agains real clusters, not just MiniHS2

Any insight from a veteran Hive developer would be very much appreciated.

Thanks,
Peter

Added a parallelized + parametrized junit runner

The parallelized execution bitten me, as it should :)

The regexp was not corrext for removing messages indicating that the thread is waiting for a lock. Fixed now.

The test failures are known flaky tests:
- HIVE-16256 - Flaky test: TestCliDriver.testCliDriver[comments]
- HIVE-15776 - Flaky test: TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver vector_if_expr

It would be nice if someone could review this. Could you take a look [~kgyrtkirk], [~cwsteinbach], [~vihangk1], [~ngangam]?

Thanks,
Peter

[~pvary] This patch will be reviewed by [~ychena]

[~pvary], There are two kinds of log messages related to the acquire lock:
1. Acquired the compile lock.
2. Waiting to acquire compile lock: ....   Acquired the compile lock.
It seems that the filter handle remove the second case, how about the first case (without waiting one). Can it cause sometimes the out file has "Acquired the compile lock.", sometimes not? 
Thanks


Thanks [~ychena] for the catch!
Indeed, it is possible that "Acquired the compile lock." message will appear depending on racing conditions, so removed it. First we remove when it appear in the block with "Waiting to acquire compile lock:", and if there is any left without the waiting message, then remove the ones which was acquired without waiting.

Thanks,
Peter

The test failures are not related:

- HIVE-15165 - Flaky test: TestSparkNegativeCliDriver


[~pvary], I do not know this part of code well, correct me if I am wrong. How do you make sure filter related to Waiting to ... used first?

Waiting to acquire compile lock: some command
Acquired the compile lock

Can above end us as:
Waiting to acquire compile lock: some command

Could only using following filter or something similar be safer?
.addFilter("(?s)\nWaiting to acquire compile lock:.*?Acquired the compile lock.\n", "\nAcquired the compile lock.\n")

You are right [~ychena], it was only implementation detail which made it sure, that the order is correct, so you proposed change is much better.

Changed the patch.
