Integration tests using {{GitServer}} such as {{TestIntegrationGitActionExecutor}} may call {{GitServer#start()}} when the underlying {{Daemon}} has already been started, or {{GitServer#stopAndCleanupReposServer()}} when the underlying {{Daemon}} has not yet been started. We need to assert lifecycle state first before calling any {{Daemon}} methods.
