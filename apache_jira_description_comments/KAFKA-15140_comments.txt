Hi, I'm interested in this issue,  can I be assigned to it?

Sure thing. Please go ahead [~isding_l] . Let me know if you are stuck somewhere and need help. Also tag me on for code review once you have a PR out. 

This is still flaky, it seems the internal topic is also under min isr partitions.

https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka-pr/job/PR-13562/23/testReport/junit/kafka.admin/TopicCommandIntegrationTest/Build___JDK_8_and_Scala_2_12___testDescribeUnderMinIsrPartitionsMixed_String__quorum_kraft/

Moved to 3.7.0 as it is not a blocker for 3.6.0.

Another instance: https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka-pr/job/PR-14458/3/testReport/junit/kafka.admin/TopicCommandIntegrationTest/Build___JDK_17_and_Scala_2_13___testDescribeUnderMinIsrPartitionsMixed_String__quorum_kraft/

I've created a PR to fix it : 

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/14891

Changing target fix version to 3.8 since this is not a blocker and we are cutting a 3.7 RC
