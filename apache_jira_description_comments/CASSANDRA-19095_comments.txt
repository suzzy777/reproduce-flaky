Known issue from CASSANDRA-18715. It was reported that follow-up tickets will be opened, though I think that was forgotten, maybe?

Yep, we found some flakies after CASSANDRA-18715 was committed without the final CI round, but it seems we forgot to create tickets for them. The remaining tests are:
 * {{VectorDistributedTest.rangeRestrictedTest}}
 * {{VectorDistributedTest.testPartitionRestrictedVectorSearch}}
 * {{CQLVectorTest.sandwichBetweenUDTs}}

We'll need to check if those are still failing and create tickets for them. Here are repeated CI runs to see if they are still there:

You are correct, it was forgotten. I have now raised CASSANDRA-19185 to investigate these failures. I should point out that  the CQLVectorTest.sandwichBetweenUDTs was introduced by CASSANDRA-18964 and did not form part of the CASSANDRA-18715 CEP-30 ticket. I will wait for the current CI runs to complete before raising a ticket for this failure.

I have done a quick investigation of CQLVectorTest.sandwichBetweenUDTs locally. I can get the failure to reproduce if the whole class is run repeatedly but I can get it to repeat if the test is run on its own. The failure is the same each time and reflects the failures seen in CI

{code:java}
org.apache.cassandra.schema.SchemaKeyspace$MissingColumns: Columns not found in schema table for cql_test_keyspace.table_20

{code}

It is always table_20 that is the failure point.

I'm just marking up the rest of the test to find out which one creates table_20 and I'll report back.
