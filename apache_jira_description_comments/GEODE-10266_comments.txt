[~mivanac] This failure is in a test that was recently [added in this PR|https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7517] for GEODE-10020. It seems like the test is flaky. Would it be possible to assign this ticket to you since you wrote the test?

It looks like there were two failures of the test in the PR pre-checkin while you were working on addressing review comments too, so ideally the PR would not have been merged until that had been addressed.

First PR failure: [https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/builds/48410232#L626524d8:560]

Second PR failure: [https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/builds/48456881#L6265370b:560]

It's not clear yet what the failure rate for this test is, but if it's failing often, the commit may need to be reverted.
