Since there is significant code execution path between the server setting the query state to 'RUNNING' and getting a valid job id from the MR framework, there is a possibility that the GetOperationStatus can return a response without the job id. I was able to recreate the same with some modifications to the testTaskStatus method such that i printed the OperationStatus in a loop and here is the output: 


{code}
org.apache.hive.service.cli.TestEmbeddedThriftBinaryCLIService-output.txt:task statuses: [{"beginTime":1485164047542,"taskId":"Stage-1","taskState":"RUNNING","taskType":"MAPRED","name":"MAPRED","elapsedTime":531}]
org.apache.hive.service.cli.TestEmbeddedThriftBinaryCLIService-output.txt:task statuses: [{"beginTime":1485164047542,"taskId":"Stage-1","externalHandle":"job_local1872526010_0001","taskState":"RUNNING","taskType":"MAPRED","name":"MAPRED","elapsedTime":2182}]
org.apache.hive.service.cli.TestEmbeddedThriftBinaryCLIService-output.txt:task statuses: [{"beginTime":1485164047542,"endTime":1485164049995,"taskId":"Stage-1","externalHandle":"job_local1872526010_0001","taskState":"FINISHED","taskType":"MAPRED","name":"MAPRED","statusMessage":"2017-01-23 01:34:09,982 Stage-1 map = 0%,  reduce = 100%","elapsedTime":2453,"returnValue":0}]
{code}

As it can be seen from the first line we get a running state without the handle and the test is validating that the job id /  handle should always be present if the state is 'RUNNING'.. hence i am removing the check from test. Anyhow, this is checked in the 'FINISHED' state of the query in test.

    HIVE-15711 :  Flaky TestEmbeddedThriftBinaryCLIService.testTaskStatus

    The 'RUNNING' state can be set way before the job handle from MR frameworks is available to be set on the server in the taskDisplay, hence there is a possibility that we can receive jobStatus messages without the job id. Hence its not guaranteed  that it is  not null in running status hence removing this condition check. This will be checked anyways when the status is 'FINISHED'.Printing the status before validation so in case of validation failures we will know why it failed
