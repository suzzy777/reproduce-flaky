Need help with this.

for this
{noformat}
xmppServer.startXmppEndpoint();
Thread.Sleep(2000){noformat}
 

what should be in the until function?

 
{noformat}
Awaitility
        .await()
        .atMost(Durations.TWO_SECONDS)
        .until(()->true);{noformat}

Yes. Feel free to go ahead and submit. Thanks

Are you sure that it will help to fix the flakiness of the test? Personally, I would expect to have a condition tested by Awaitility otherwise I'm afraid we will get the same behavior but with a more complex code, don't you agree?

It should be something like
{code:java}
Awaitility
        .await()
        .atMost(Durations.TWO_SECONDS) 
        .until(()->xmppServer.isRunning());{code}

Thank You. I will start working on this.

In XmppRouteChatIT, do we need to have thread.sleep()?

I don't know what would be the awaility equivalent of 
{noformat}
template.sendBody("direct:toConsumer", body1);
Thread.sleep(50);
template.sendBody("direct:toConsumer", body2);{noformat}

Hey [~itachi], on those cases, if you believe it's not convertable ... then it's OK to leave as is.

I'll take this one

Some of those that could be fixed were resolved by the linked PR. The remaining ones need changes to the xmpp test container.
