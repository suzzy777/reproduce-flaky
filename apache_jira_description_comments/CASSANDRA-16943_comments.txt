This is quite an old ticket and many fixes and changes have gone in since. As far as [Jenkins|https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-trunk/971/testReport/dtest.materialized_views_test/TestMaterializedViews/test_view_metadata_cleanup/history/] and [Butler|https://butler.cassandra.apache.org/#/ci/upstream/compare/Cassandra-trunk/trunk] are concerned this hasn't failed as far back as history goes. So closing for now but we can reopen if needed or if anybody disagrees.
