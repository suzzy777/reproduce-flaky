It seems to be happening since Apr 24. Any idea on what the project, instance id of the instance used for testing?

Looks like these parameters are passed into the TestPipeline.

Sorry. i missed the default values.

It seems like the latency for the CreateDatabase calls has increased to more than a minute of late. I have filed an internal bug to debug this for the above instance.

Thanks Allen. Assigning this to you for tracking the internal issue.

This seems to be a transient issue. i'm unable to track the database that caused the failures. All the runs after the failures have been successful. Do let me know if i can close this issue as "Cannot reproduce"
