1. for first error, assertEquals(ccp.getQueueSize(), ccp.getQueueSizeStat()); These stats are not updated in sync, so it can fail.
2. for second error, may be just increase wait time..

    GEODE-3502: Added awaitility clauses.

    	* Added awaitility clauses while waiting for the stat comparison checks
    	* Replaced the deprecated Wait Criterion with Awaitility clause with increased timeout
    	* Replaced the invokeAsync with invoke to make the test identical to the one in ClientHealthStatsDUnitTest
    	* Removed the commented out flaky tag
