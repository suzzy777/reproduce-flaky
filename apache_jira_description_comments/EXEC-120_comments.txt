[~agorguy] The test cases in question pass consistently for me locally with {{mvn clean test}}. They also consistently pass on GitHub [1]. Unless you can tell me what you think is specifically wrong with those test cases and how they should be fixed or improved I see little value in adding anything to the project README concerning those tests. In any case, the README for the Commons components is generated at release time, so a Javadoc comment would only make sense anyway, this would not be information for the README.

[~ggregory] , sorry for the delay in response, and thank you for your feedback.

I completely understand your viewpoint regarding the test cases passing consistently for you locally and on GitHub. However, I'd like to emphasize the importance of including a minimum specification for the project (in the README) to prevent potential flaky test scenarios that might arise for other users or contributors. The intention is to educate +developers and users+ about the importance of having a minimum requirement for stable test execution.

By including the minimum required RAM and CPU in the README, we can prevent unexpected test failures caused by insufficient resources on {+}developers' machines{+}. This information requires minimal effort to add, but can save developers from the headache of debugging flaky test failures if their machines don't meet the recommended specifications. It also helps set the right expectations for project users.

Thank you for your consideration.
