DataFrameRangeSuite.test("Cancelling stage in a query with Range.") stays sometimes in an infinite loop and times out the build.

I presume the original intention of this test is to start a job with range and just cancel it.
The submitted job has 2 stages but I think the author tried to cancel the first stage with ID 0 which is not the case here:

{code:java}
eventually(timeout(10.seconds), interval(1.millis)) {
  assert(DataFrameRangeSuite.stageToKill > 0)
}
{code}

All in all if the first stage is slower than 10 seconds it throws TestFailedDueToTimeoutException and cancelStage will be never ever called.
