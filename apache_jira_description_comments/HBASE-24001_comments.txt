please consider:
* limiting the number of executed branches in parallel
* configure the [build timeout plugin|https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-timeout/] so that after some time it will just give up...so it doesn't need a human to recover...


same goes for:
https://builds.apache.org/job/HBase-Flaky-Tests/

Thanks for the intercession [~kgyrtkirk].  A few of us going over your suggestions doing some cleanup. Will report back.

On timeout, we have https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-basic-steps/#timeout-enforce-time-limit configured for 6 hours on our nightly pipeline runs (The build timeout plugin won't work for plugins apparently).

Link to HBASE-24016 where we are changing some nightlies to run only when change.

HBASE-24017 turns down frequency at which flakies run.

[~kgyrtkirk] Ok by you if I resolve this now?

All of our nightlies were changed to poll and only run if changes made (previous they would run regardless) and the flakey suite tests has been turned off on a bunch of branches and made less frequent on non-hot branches. I've been studying https://builds.apache.org/label/Hadoop/load-statistics?type=min since changes were made. Now there are always free executors; for sure there is no back-up waiting on free executors as there was previous to the above changes.

of course; thank you [~stack] for all your efforts fixing this!
the load-statistics page doesn't load for me for some reason (builds.apache.org unreachable ATM) ; but looking at ticketes/discussions/etc it should be fixed by now...I'll close the ticket

Looks like Jenkins was restarted earlier: https://builds.apache.org/label/Hadoop/load-statistics?type=min

Thank you for taking the time to dig in on builds and figure us as the resource-hog. We still use a bunch but way less now because of your notice.
