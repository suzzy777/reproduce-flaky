I see in https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/HBase-TRUNK/6202/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.coprocessor/TestMasterObserver/testRegionTransitionOperations/  , now we have added in timeouts, that we are failing to disable a table. It looks like table is disabled but regions are being opened on the disabled table still, like HBASE-6537

Let me see if can figure why this happening. Will be back.
