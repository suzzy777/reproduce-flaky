I wholesale replaced 'INFO' with 'DEBUG': https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra?branch=CASSANDRA-16176

Nothing broke, but it also didn't produce debug output (outside of CCM, which is odd.)

For ci-cassandra.a.o this was fixed with https://github.com/apache/cassandra-builds/commit/95aad36a88baccda5a89a26a0cbeea8333902062

The option {{\-\-log-level=INFO}} was replaced with {{\-\-log-cli-level=DEBUG}}.

The debug logging is available in the jenkins builds console, as well as uploaded and saved on nightlies.a.o in the {{test_stdout.txt.xz}} file.
For example: https://nightlies.apache.org/cassandra/Cassandra-devbranch-dtest/label=cassandra,split=1/51/

[~brandon.williams] I gave it a go. [Here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/178/workflows/7a5e5dce-ce05-49c8-8bb1-5ff23b839666/jobs/1391/artifacts] is the run. 2 q:
 - Is this what you wanted? (we still need high and med res test runs before merging if you confirm)
 - Why not TRACE instead of DEBUG?

bq. Here is the run and here a sample log file. 

I can't access the logs you have linked to. "AccessDenied" (expired).

Apologies wrong link. [Here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/178/workflows/7a5e5dce-ce05-49c8-8bb1-5ff23b839666/jobs/1391/artifacts] is the right one. I can see DEBUG info both in the log files and on stdout.txt for ccm and for tests.

bq. Why not TRACE instead of DEBUG?

I thought that may be a bit heavy, but if not I'm ok with that, as long as it is consistent between circle and jenkins.

TRACE is indeed heavier so I am happy to leave it at DEBUG and we can change it later if needed. I have pushed and ran CI for low, mid and high res. The 3 display DEBUG for the nodes logs, ccm and the py test itself. Look for {{test_split}} in the CI run {{Artifacts}} tab. Then look inside the {{stdout.txt}} for that executor for {{Run stress to ensure data is readable}} to locate a py test DEBUG message:
- HIGH: [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/179/workflows/61825d09-50b5-475f-b8af-779381a741c8] [j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/179/workflows/9bf31e85-9b86-43da-82a7-130af992cc1d]

- LOW: [j11|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/177/workflows/663735e6-0acf-455c-8b85-545bbd1d9ea7] [j8|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/bereng/cassandra/177/workflows/34090602-f24c-4b10-9066-51a3f6090f0f]

If this is what you needed it is ready to merge imo.

Committed, thanks!
