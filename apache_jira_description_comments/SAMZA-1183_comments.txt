    SAMZA-1183: Fix async run loop tests

    Changes
    * Moved all states locally within the test methods(no global state, since tests can be run parallely).
    * Increased the timeout waiting for all task threads to finish.
    * Changed message chooser mock to return null at the end(When EOS message is used a final msg, during some runs task.process gets invoked more than once for it. This is due to test setup, other tests within this test class also do the same.)
    
    How was it verified: 
    
    Ran the test class repeatedly to check for failures(there were none).
    
    `
    while [ $i -lt 30 ] do     sleep 3;     i=`expr $i + 1`;     ./gradlew :samza-core:clean :samza-core:test -Dtest.single=TestAsyncRunLoop  done
    `

[~spvenkat]
I am re-opening this as the tests are still failing. The one test failure I found in jenkins had this in the log:
{code}
:samza-core_2.11:test

testCommitSingleTask FAILED
    Wanted but not invoked:
    offsetManager.checkpoint(
        Partition [partition=0]
    );
    -> at org.apache.samza.task.TestAsyncRunLoop.testCommitSingleTask(TestAsyncRunLoop.java:370)

    However, there were other interactions with this mock:
    offsetManager.update(
        Partition [partition=1],
        SystemStreamPartition [testSystem, testStream, 1],
        "1"
    );
    -> at org.apache.samza.task.AsyncRunLoop$AsyncTaskWorker$6.run(AsyncRunLoop.java:527)

    offsetManager.update(
        Partition [partition=0],
        SystemStreamPartition [testSystem, testStream, 0],
        "0"
    );
    -> at org.apache.samza.task.AsyncRunLoop$AsyncTaskWorker$6.run(AsyncRunLoop.java:527)
        at org.apache.samza.task.TestAsyncRunLoop.testCommitSingleTask(TestAsyncRunLoop.java:370)

462 tests completed, 1 failed, 1 skipped
:samza-core_2.11:test FAILED
{code}

I merged it with LinkedIn internal repository. However, it simply hangs the build on hudson. So, I am not sure which test causes the build to hang. The hanging is not transient. It happens every time I try to run the build. 
I was able to pass the build successfully only after uncommenting all tests in this class.

I suggest the following:
* reverting this change even in open-source 
* remove tests that don't actually have any assertions
* Possibly, simplify tests
