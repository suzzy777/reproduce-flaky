GEODE-5424: Changing all awaitility calls to use consistent timings

We have a lot of Awaitility calls in our tests. Each test was picking
its own timeout. That lead to some tests picking too small of a timeout
and failing spuriously.

With this change, all tests will use a new factory,
GeodeAwaility.await(), rather than Awaitility.await(). This new factory
sets a default timeout of 5 minutes. It also sets a sensible pollDelay
and pollInterval.

The custom timeouts used in all tests have been removed, in favor of
this new factory, except for a couple of tests that had waits greater
than 5 minutes.

GEODE-5424: Replacing calls to waitForCriterion with Awaitility

Replacing all of the calls to waitForCriterion with awaitility instead,
to use a standard timeout.

GEODE-5424: Fixing a test that was using awaitility as a sleep

PersistentColocatedPartitionedRegionDUnitTest and QueryDataDUnitTest
previously were using Awaitility as an overcomplicated way to make a
thread sleep.

We should eliminate these sleeps, but to avoid changing behavior with
this PR, switching the Awaitility calls into regular sleeps.

GEODE-5424: Fix tests with races relying on a poll delay

These tests all were only passing because awaitility waited 100 ms
before testing anything. They may all be existing flaky tests.

- ClusterDistributionManagerForAdminDUnitTest - if the assertion ever
  failed, it would fail the awaility with a formatting error
- testLeadShutdownAndCoordFailure - Further clauses also needed to be in
  awailitility.
- testConcurrentOperationsDunitTestOnBlockingQueue
- recoversFromCloseDuringRegionOperation

GEODE-5424: Adding a spotless rule to enforce using GeodeAwaitility

Any tests that use regular awaitility will now fail the spotless check,
to avoid checking tests that don't pick up our default wait time.
