Tests show that GridCacheDatabaseSharedManager#splitAndSortCpPagesIfNeeded call can last several seconds on nodes with big amount of memory (>10GB). We should optimize sorting algorithm, possibly making it multithreaded.
Another option to make pages write throttling more smooth is to get rid of this heuristic:
{noformat}
                // Starting with 0.05 to avoid throttle right after checkpoint start
                // 7/12 is maximum ratio of dirty pages
                dirtyRatioThreshold = (dirtyRatioThreshold * 0.95 + 0.05) * 7 / 12;
{noformat}
We should replace "magic" lower bound 0.05 * 7 / 12 with the real percentage of dirty pages at the moment of GridCacheDatabaseSharedManager.Checkpointer#markCheckpointBegin call return.
