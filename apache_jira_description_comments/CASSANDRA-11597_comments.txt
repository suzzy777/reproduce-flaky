Saw what looks like the same thing here:

http://cassci.datastax.com/job/cassandra-2.1_dtest_jdk8/209/testReport/upgrade_supercolumns_test/TestSCUpgrade/upgrade_with_counters_test/

Given that I've seen this error on this test before, and that it does flap at a steady rate: http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized_dtest_multiplexer/69/testReport/
and that this is happening during the 2.0 steps in thrift code, I imagine this is not a huge problem. I'm not sure how we want to shore up this test to reduce the number of timeouts.

[~philipthompson] If I understand correctly, this test is always starting on 1.2 and upgrading to 2.0.17 . If another 2.0 release is unlikely, can we just retire this test?

I wish :(. After the upgrade to 2.0.17, it then undergoes an upgrade to 2.1. We won't be able to retire this until 2.1 is EOL.

I made a dtest pr with a "fix" of sorts for this test: https://github.com/riptano/cassandra-dtest/pull/960

I'm trying out a bulk run of the test to confirm it works as expected in the failure case, over here: http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized_dtest_multiplexer/86/

another run here with newer code from my github pr:
http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized_dtest_multiplexer/90/

using the flaky plugin with up to 3 tries looks pretty good here: http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Parameterized/job/parameterized_dtest_multiplexer/93/

pr merged. this test will now use flaky so it can retry in narrow circumstances when dealing with routine timeouts.
