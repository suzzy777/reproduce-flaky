Similar to HBASE-13182 and HBASE-13041 TestHBaseFsck relies on create/deleteTable() to be sync. so, if the master side is slow we get EXPIRED_TABLE_LOCK failures.

to workaround that, we can add a master coprocessor used by the test to wait until postOperationHandler is called. This will be removed after HBASE-13204.

there is also a znode for the table-lock not deleted.
