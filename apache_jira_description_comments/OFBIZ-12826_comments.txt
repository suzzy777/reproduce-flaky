Hi Clay,

Thanks for your proposition.

Almost 3 weeks ago [I have asked the OFBiz dev community|https://lists.apache.org/thread/pmgj2s3hojv7m3w5wm04bhmff3cy9qt5] if we would be interested to do so. I got no answer. I must also say that, after having a look at your references, I don't exactly see what pushing your PR would add to us. 

[~jleroux] - thanks for following up. Here are a few specific examples of cases where this tool can help any project (using data from the connected Beam project):
 * Better [test failure capture|https://ge.apache.org/s/knhx64xl6gvj6/tests/:runners:samza:validatesRunnerSickbay/org.apache.beam.sdk.PipelineTest/testEmptyPipeline?top-execution=1] than plain console logsÂ 
 * Searchable build [dependency graphs|https://ge.apache.org/s/7whhcdzvwhmrg/dependencies?expandAll]
 * Aggregated [test failure analytics|https://ge.apache.org/scans/tests?search.rootProjectNames=beam&search.timeZoneId=America/Chicago] to better understand failed and flaky tests across many builds
 * Aggregated [build failure analytics|https://ge.apache.org/scans/failures?search.rootProjectNames=beam&search.timeZoneId=America/Chicago] to better understand how builds are failing

There is much more there, such as performance data, but these are some of the most often cited useful features. The PR itself would enable this for CI builds. ASF committers can then opt-in to local build scans as desired using LDAP credentials.

Hopefully that makes the value a little clearer. If there is still no desire, let me know and I can close the PR.

Thanks Clay,

I'll have a look, discuss with the community and get back to you...

Commit 805cf59180f281020d7404b886c03ebaf9295ddc in ofbiz-framework's branch refs/heads/trunk from Clay Johnson
[ https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=ofbiz-framework.git;h=805cf59180 ]

Implemented: Capture build scans on ge.apache.org to benefit from deep build insights (OFBIZ-12826) (#641)

This PR publishes a build scan for every CI build and possibly for every local build from an authenticated Apache committer. The build will not fail if publishing fails.

The build scans of the Apache OFBiz project are published to the Gradle Enterprise instance at ge.apache.org, hosted by the Apache Software Foundation and run in partnership between the ASF and Gradle. This Gradle Enterprise instance has all features and extensions enabled and is freely available for use by the Apache OFBiz project and all other Apache projects.

This pull request enhances the functionality of publishing build scans to the publicly available scans.gradle.com by instead publishing build scans to ge.apache.org. On this Gradle Enterprise instance, Apache OFBiz will have access not only to all of the published build scans but also to other aggregate data features.

Thanks Clay,

I have pushed the PR.
