[~pbacsko] can you please have a look? It seems to me that this one is also related to OOZIE-3160.

This is probably another test which should be a pure unit test. Besides, I'm not 100% convinced that we need it. I'll think about this.Â 

I'm converting this to a unit test - will upload patch soon.
