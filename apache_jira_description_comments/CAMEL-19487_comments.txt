I am not proficient enough in the underlying Camel code. [~davsclaus] [~gnodet] or [~ggrzybek] could you please have a look?

Why is this minor, [~davsclaus]?

Just for the record: I logged CAMEL-19425 as related to this (it's what it's used on the test description to disable it). I haven't had a chance to investigate this one yet.

Its when using  @DynamicRouter variant on a POJO that this can happen - works fine when using dynamicRouter EIP

                from("seda:a")
                        .dynamicRouter(method(a, "route"));


For the POJO then this can only happen if you use the same class and instantiate different objects that have different destinations.
