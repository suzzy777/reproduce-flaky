In Jetty when defining a filter, we should map them to the call types. Right now, the filters are mapped on request calls, but a call to {{/oozie}} is forwarded to {{index.jsp}}. Since this is a forward call, the filter is skipped, but when trying to get the {{extjs}} dependencies, the error 401 is thrown, so it will be processed as missing dependency, and the Oozie console disabled message will be shown instead of 401 error.

We should extend the scope of the filters.
