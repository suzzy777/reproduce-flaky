Currently we use Sauce Labs emulators on Jenkins CI for every build except file-transfer plugin:
http://cordova-ci.cloudapp.net:8080/

File transfer tests need an accessible instance of this test server:
https://github.com/apache/cordova-labs/tree/cordova-filetransfer

For this reason we run file transfer plugin builds locally against a locally deployed server. While this approach works, it is really costly to support local emulators/simulators as they present various random issues, like being slow to start (build times out) to tests being flaky because of the server being local (files downloaded too quickly?). Also, we've increased the executors count on each Jenkins node to 2, which made supporting local runs even more complicated.

Therefore, we need to move file transfer builds to the Sauce Labs.
