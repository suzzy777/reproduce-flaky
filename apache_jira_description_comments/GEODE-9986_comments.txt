This is definitely a flaky test issue. Unfortunately it is difficult to fully debug since the error is being generated from a locator launched by a {{gfsh}} invocation. It would be most helpful to see the logs of this invocation but unfortunately those are not available or visible when the test errors. I have some ideas on how to address that, but for now I believe it is safe not to consider this a `blocker`.
