[~cadonna] The PR is merged so could this issue be resolved?

[~chia7712] Sorry for the late reply. The fix solves only one of the issues with that test. Actually is solves {{test_all_brokers_bounce}}, but not {{test_broker_type_bounce}}. A fix for the latter is in progress here:

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9441 

I think we should reopen this ticket.

Thanks for the information. Reopen it

Since this is an outstanding issue, I'm changing the blocker status.  Also, I've updated the fix version to 2.8.0.

 

Thanks,

Bill

It looks like the PR didn't make the release cutoff, but it's close. I bumped it to 3.0.

PR has been merged in time for 3.0. Not sure if the issue still persists. Will close for now.
