The change in HADOOP-16138 breaks TestHDFSCLI and TestDFSShell
Since it changed the text in the exception :


{code:java}
-        throw new PathNotFoundException(itemParentPath.toString());
+        throw new PathNotFoundException(String.format(
+            "mkdir failed for path: %s. Item parent path not found: %s.",
+        itemPath.toString(), itemParentPath.toString()));
       }
{code}

For reference :

The way I plan to fix it: create this jira where I `revert` this change in the sense that I will create a PR with the original log. No need for the additional logging what we added


Thanks [~ayushtkn] for finding this issue.
