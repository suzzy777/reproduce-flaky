I've noticed that some fetcher cache tests are flaky after future `abandoned` has been introduced:
{noformat}
FetcherCacheTest.LocalCached
FetcherCacheTest.LocalUncachedExtract
FetcherCacheTest.SimpleEviction
{noformat}
The failure message:
{noformat}
Failed to wait for resource offers: discarded{noformat}
Logs are attached.
