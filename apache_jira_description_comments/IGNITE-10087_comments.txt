Most of the fails are assertions on failing coordinator node. I suggest to resolve IGNITE-5115 and take a look at the test at TC one more time.

    Fix for the test

----


{panel:title=--&gt; Run :: All: No blockers found!|borderStyle=dashed|borderColor=#ccc|titleBGColor=#D6F7C1}{panel}
[TeamCity *--&gt; Run :: All* Results|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=2826462&amp;buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_RunAll]

One of a problem was resolved in IGNITE-5115 (coordinator failing).

I have fixed the test issues: 
1. Client node disconnected issue. Getting retry future can throw {{IgniteClientDisconnectedException}}. I wrote the {{getRetryFuture}} method and use it in the client future.
2. the {{awaitPartitionMapExchange()}} can throw "Grid is in invalid state - node stopping). I added additional checks for servers stopped.
3. Redundant code cleanup.

I have tested the test locally and [on TC|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewLog.html?buildId=2825701&tab=testsInfo&buildTypeId=IgniteTests24Java8_Spi] more than 100 times.
The test can fail with a problem that described in IGNITE-1758 (less 5% fail rate). 

Can anyone review the test changes?

[~NSAmelchev],

I reviewed your change, it looks reasonable for me. All tests from test class are passing locally, so if there are no new failures on TC, please proceed with merging fix to master.

Thanks!

Thanks, merged to master.
