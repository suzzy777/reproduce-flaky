The build is failing with the following error:

{code:bash}
[ERROR] 'dependencies.dependency.version' for joda-time:joda-time:jar is missing. @ line 115, column 21
{code}

[~matijhs] can you please fix this error?




Thanks [~nobigo], [~kmarton]! I did not delete the dependency from sharelib-pig. Not sure about the impact of missing joda-time when running pig jobs though. Added new patch

joda time was added to pig sharelib by OOZIE-1848 5 years ago. [~matijhs] could you please test  if the pig example works with your modification?

It seems to me that they require joda-time: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.pig/pig/0.16.0 . That should be added automatically if pig list it as a dependency. [~matijhs] Is it added by default to the pig sharelib if you apply your changes? 



[~asalamon74], the following transitive joda-time jars are added by default to the oozie distro with applied patch:

{noformat}
./embedded-oozie-server/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/joda-time-2.5.jar
./share/lib/pig/joda-time-2.1.jar
./share/lib/hcatalog/joda-time-2.5.jar
./share/lib/hive2/joda-time-2.5.jar
./share/lib/hive/joda-time-2.5.jar
./share/lib/spark/joda-time-2.9.jar
{noformat}

All of them were joda-time-2.9.9 before the patch

[~matijhs] Ouch. It's not a good idea to downgrade the joda version in the sharelibs (and in oozie-server) even if the projects require and old version. We should probably use the same joda versions just like before the patch.

I agree :) I put back the dependency to the root pom.xml to force the versions to 2.9.9, thanks [~asalamon74]!

Now the distro will look like this:
{noformat}
./embedded-oozie-server/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/joda-time-2.9.9.jar
./share/lib/pig/joda-time-2.9.9.jar
./share/lib/hcatalog/joda-time-2.9.9.jar
./share/lib/hive2/joda-time-2.9.9.jar
./share/lib/hive/joda-time-2.9.9.jar
./share/lib/spark/joda-time-2.9.9.jar
{noformat}

[~matijhs] Maybe it would be better to only define the version number in the root pom and refer to it explicitly it the sharelibs. What do you think? It would make it more clear that we don't really want to use joda directly.

I agree [~asalamon74], but in this case I would exclude the transitive joda-time from oozie-core, so we will only package them in the necessary sharelib projects.
