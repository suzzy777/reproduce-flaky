[~mirg] thanks for reporting this, always taking snapshot is not an ideal solution, which will cause long quorum unavailable time in case the snapshot is more than a few GB. 

Internally, we solved this issue via force cleaning the in-memory DB if the previous SNAP sync failed before persisted with NEWLEADER packet, I'll upstream our internal patch for this.

[~mirg] I've sent a PR for fixing this issue, please take a look when you have time.
