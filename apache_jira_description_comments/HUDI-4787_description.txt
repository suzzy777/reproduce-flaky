After [https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6098] this change in streaming sink, testRunHoodieJavaAppOnMultiPartitionKeysMORTable fails intermittently. Upon debugging, I found that the thread of delete operation in HoodieJavaStreamingApp#run has not yet completed but the validation starts. The flakiness could be due to extra time that for reading checkpoint metadata in each microbatch (due to #6098). A better way would be to rewrite this test. I am not sure why delete is even required.
