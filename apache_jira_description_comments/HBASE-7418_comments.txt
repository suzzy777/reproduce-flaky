* removed the thread.sleep() in the link cleaner test
* used the proper tempDir of the test in StoreFile (the created stuff was not deleted)

looks reasonable. Are the broken tests known flakies? 



Also, I've encountered the HFileLink flakeyness before and it seems to pass for me now.

Note -- I generally have been doing testing against hdfs 2.0, so this maybe related to that?

running the single test works fine for me too,
but on jenkins sometimes fail, maybe machine too loaded and slow. and the thread.sleep() is not enough (and not really needed to test the link cleaner).
and then there're left over in the default hbase-site.xml instead of the temp dir that can conflict with other stuff.

it shouldn't make any difference between hadoop 1.x or 2.x, the code is quite straightforward.

Can we also backport this to 0.94.

[~lhofhansl] Some test fixes that you might consider backporting?

Yes. Anything that helps with 0.94. 0.94 tests are in very bad shape.

HFileLink are not in 0.94, though, right?

HFileLink are not in 0.94

[~lhofhansl] Yes. That is correct it seems.  Sorry. Thought it was there.

I committed to hbase-6055 branch.  I can't really tell of this makes a difference correctness wise, but removing pauses to make them run fast is worth it IMO.
