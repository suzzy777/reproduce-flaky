IMPALA-9830: Fix flakiness in test_mt_dop_scan_node

This test has inherent flakiness due to it relying on instances
fetching scan ranges from a shared queue. The time sensitivity
enhanced the flakiness on a release build. So this change decreases
the mt_dop level to 8 which results in a failure rate of 0.05%.
This along with increasing the num of tries should make sure flakiness
is removed.
