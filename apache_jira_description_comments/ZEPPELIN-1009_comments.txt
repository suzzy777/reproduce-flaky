    Fixed all error on `Zeppelin.java`
    
    
    ```try { handleException("Debug 1", new RuntimeException()); } catch (Exception e) {};```
    
    now getting errors from `ParagraphIT`
    
    ```
    Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 88.873 sec - in org.apache.zeppelin.integration.ZeppelinIT
    
    Results :
    
    Tests in error: 
      ParagraphActionsIT.testRemoveButton:149->AbstractZeppelinIT.waitForParagraph:88->AbstractZeppelinIT.pollingWait:114 » Timeout
      ParagraphActionsIT.testMoveUpAndDown:186->AbstractZeppelinIT.waitForParagraph:88->AbstractZeppelinIT.pollingWait:114 » Timeout
      ParagraphActionsIT.testCreateNewButton:80->AbstractZeppelinIT.waitForParagraph:88->AbstractZeppelinIT.pollingWait:114 » Timeout
    
    Tests run: 15, Failures: 0, Errors: 3, Skipped: 0
    ```
    
    Here's some experiments about `ParagraphIT` error,
    
    - It passes on my local machine with firefox 31.0 (the same version with travis uses)
    - It passes on my travis account, constantly
    - It fails on apache travis account, constantly
    
    And i tried narrow down what cause the error on apache travis account, and in case of `ParagraphActionIT.testCreateNewButton`, it opens paragraph's setting dropdown menu successfully,
    
    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/16178412/d40dfb72-35fb-11e6-961e-ea37ea4ac15b.png)
    
    And i believe it locates `Inserts New` button and click(), but nothing happens and test fails.

    Sounds great! Shall we merge this guy then, and handle this nasty click in `ParagraphActionIT.testCreateNewButton` in separate pr?

    @bzz @Leemoonsoo, you said "i believe it locates Inserts New button and click(), but nothing happens and test fails".
    
    This may be related to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1033. It's not just integration test which fails, the actual functions seem to be broken.


Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1034
  
    @bzz Let me merge this into master and branch-0.6 then
    @randerzander Thanks for reporting the problem. yes they might be related!
