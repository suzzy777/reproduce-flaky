    [ZEPPELIN-1810] Removed incorrect usage of getString

    Hot Fix
    
    ### Todos
    * [ ] - Task
    
    ### What is the Jira issue?
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1810
    
    ### How should this be tested?
    Before this fix, after setting `zeppelin.ssl` to true in `zeppelin-site.xml` and setting `zeppelin.ssl.keystore.path` to a relative path to a keystore (technically it doens't have to exist at all) and setting `zeppelin.ssl.truststore.path` to a relative path to a truststore Zeppelin won't start. In the log you can read something like
    ```WARN [2016-12-14 13:55:45,522] ({main} AbstractLifeCycle.java[setFailed]:212) - FAILED SslContextFactory@8f2098e(/home/firearrow/zeppelin/incubator-zeppelin/conf/null,/home/firearrow/zeppelin/incubator-zeppelin/conf/null): java.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/firearrow/zeppelin/incubator-zeppelin/conf/null (No such file or directory)```
    
    With this fix the correct path is resolved

    * Does the licenses files need update? No
    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? No

    Please check the build failure, but it might be a flaky test.
    
    Otherwise, LGTM. Tested on master with these changes on top of #1757 and all looks good with relative path trust store.

    Failure seems unrelated... It fails with a null pointer here: https://github.com/FireArrow/zeppelin/blob/ZEPPELIN-1810%5D/zeppelin-zengine/src/test/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/NotebookTest.java#L309
    But it only happened on one of the build jobs. Not sure what that's about.

    And after rebasing master the failure is gone. Some kind of race in the test? Anyway, it doesn't seem to be related to the changes in this pull request

As this is a security issue, can we get a new release? This is making it difficult to incorporate an open source solution in my educational institution with all the security requirements.
