    Please add "CB-12317" as a prefix to your PR title.
    I've also added https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-12317 which was required in the PR template.

    You should also document it on the README.md

    Added usage instructions to `README.md` and rebased.

    I've fixed the CI problem and would like this PR to be green before I pull it in. Can you rebase? It should re-test the PR automatically after.

    Sorry, this needs a further rebase (CI changes). Thanks!


Github user fkoester commented on the issue:

    Rebased to latest master.

    Not sure if it was done properly - see #27 last commit, those files should have been in the rebase.

    What do you mean? All commits from master are in this PR's branch too. Which files do you mean exactly?

    Hmm indeed when I go to your branch https://github.com/fkoester/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/commits/swipe-navigation it does have the required commits, and when I tested this locally everything is fine. 
    
    My apologies -- it might just be the CI acting up. Can you close then re-open this PR to re-trigger the CI (sorry, Apache doesn't give us the permissions to do this ourselves on Github). If that still fails, I'll just pull this in since I already manually verified it passes and can just chalk this up to CI flakiness.

    CB-12317: Allow to configure navigation by gestures

    ### Platforms affected
    All iOS devices supporting the WKWebView.
    
    ### What does this PR do?
    This PR adds a new configuration option `AllowBackForwardNavigationGestures`, which is disabled by default. You can enable it in your `config.xml` via:
    
    ```xml
    <preference name="AllowBackForwardNavigationGestures" value="true" />
    ```
    
    Afterwards, the navigation gestures for forward/backward are enabled in the WebView (aka "Swipe Navigation").
    
    ### What testing has been done on this change?
    * I tested it without this preference set => swipe navigation disabled like before (backwards compatability)
    * I tested it with the preference set to `true` like above => swipe navigation enabled. You can swipe back and forward like in Safari.

    CI build still fails :-(

    Alright I'm going to ignore the CI -- the last line of the CI build log is
    > /Users/travis/build.sh: line 155: shell_session_update: command not found
    which is related to this bug: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6307 which says that the fix is to use a stable rvm

    Filed #31 to fix Travis CI issue, hopefully it works

    @shazron @fkoester is there a way to dynamically change this preference? I see theres an `updateWithInfo` function but I don't know how to call it.
    
    https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/blob/master/src/ios/CDVWKWebViewEngine.m#L281
    
    I don't want to be able to swipe when, for example, the sidebar is open.
