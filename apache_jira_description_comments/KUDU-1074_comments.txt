Seems like delete-table-test just got a lot more flaky due to this. Let's try to fix it so that it's not obscuring other failures.

Reopening and moving this to GA since we have a temporary workaround for the test failures

see the linked JIRA for the outstanding patch which started to address this

[~adar] since this uses SyncLeaderMasterRPC, this should be fixed now, right?

bq. Adar Dembo since this uses SyncLeaderMasterRPC, this should be fixed now, right?

Yes. But ListTables has been using SyncLeaderMasterRPC since before this JIRA was filed, so I don't think it was actually responsible. I can't make heads or tails of Mike's earlier code review either.

I think it's safe to call it fixed, though. I don't see any failures like this in the flaky test dashboard.

Yea, I did the same source code digging and also seemed like it's been using SyncLeaderMasterRPC forever. I was figuring that somewhere along the line you fixed/improved the retry behavior to that utility function. Agreed that resolving seems to make sense unless we see it pop up again on flakies.
