As thin client protocol interprets first 4 bytes as message size and allocate array for it. Any "big" 4 bytes sent on thin client port could leads to OOM.

Some ideas to resolve:
 - print WARN in case of big client message
 - allocate array not for all message, but allocate it gradually.
 - read more then first4 bytes to understand is it real client message, or it is some trash.
