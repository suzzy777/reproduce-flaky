There are a fairly extensive number of locations found via code inspection which use unsafe methods of handling addresses in a dual-stack or IPv6-only world:
- splits on the first ":" assuming that delimits a host from a port
- produces a host port pair by appending :port blindly (Java prefers [ipv6]:port which is the standard for IPv6 URIs)
- depends on the behavior of InetSocketAddress.toString() which produces the above.

This patch fixes those metaphors that I can find above, and replaces calls to InetSocketAddress.toString() with a wrapper that properly brackets the IPv6 address if there is one.
