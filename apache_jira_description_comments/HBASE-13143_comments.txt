bq. When I ran this unit test on a macbook after a minute the fan was running so fast I thought it would take flight.
Lol :)

Related, we should look at not hitting disk where we don't need to when running unit tests (HBASE-13144)

This is a frequent problem with the 0.98 builds on Apache Jenkins, raising priority so someone will get to it, perhaps me, before the next release.

I'm taking this one [~apurtell]. This flaky test also shows in our testing rigs from time to time and its just an annoyance. 

Thanks. This keeps getting pushed down the pile and I've been out recently. 

What seems critical here is the different cache on write options and whether or not to cache compressed data or not. Removing the block encoder variation drops the number of tests from > 200 to 72.
