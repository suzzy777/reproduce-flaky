This test is based on {{ReservationTest.ReserveShareWithinRole}}, which apparently has been flaky since it was introduced on May 2015.

Both tests have a bug, they do the following to create a {{Filter}} to decline resources "forever":

{noformat}
filtersForever.set_refuse_seconds(std::numeric_limits<double>::max());
{noformat}

But that doesn't work as expected, because the maximum value for {{Filter::refuse_seconds}} is {{Duration::max().ns() / Seconds(1).ns()}}, so the allocator uses the default {{Filter}} instead (5 seconds).

Both tests consistently fail once I fix the "forever" filter.

I have to do some more digging to find out if there's a bug/race in the allocator or if the tests should be fixed.

The tests are flaky, because Mesos will clear a filter right away if {{Filter::refuse_seconds}} is set to a very large number.

Fixing MESOS-7660 and MESOS-7661 should make the tests stable.

Fixed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-7660.
