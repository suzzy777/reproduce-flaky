Code looks good.

However, raising the margin decreases the flakiness, but I'm not sure it eliminates it. In such cases I personally prefer to have a large number of points in the individual test (which this already has), a fixed seed, and a lower error margin.

Friendly ping that this is sitting in "Ready to Commit" and has been for quite some time. Still applicable? Going to improve it or commit as is? 

ah thanks for the ping

committed the lazy approach since this I don't think this has failed for a long time (and bumping the margin should make it "never" fail...).
