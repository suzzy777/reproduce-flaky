    Added additional synchronization to a previously flaky test.
    
    This test did not make sure that the agent's task status update manager
    had received a task status update acknowledgemtn before launching a
    subsequent task. The agent then, given its state, correctly rejected the
    task.
    
    This patch adds additional synchronization so the agent has finished
    processing the task status update like expected.
