Sorry, it's my misunderstanding of SPARK_VER in travis. It is only used for downloading spark distribution. We need to specify spark profile explicitly for building with specific version of spark.

    ZEPPELIN-1918. Fix build with Spark 2.1.0

    ### What is this PR for?
    It's my misunderstanding of `SPARK_VER` in travis. It is only used for downloading spark distribution. We need to specify spark profile explicitly for building with specific version of spark. This PR add new profile for spark 2.1 and fix the build issue with spark 2.1.0 because `SecurityManager` changes its constructor signature in spark 2.1

    CI failure is not relevant.

    @Leemoonsoo @jongyoul @felixcheung @ejono Please help review.

    wait, in travis, I don't think we want to replace 2.0.1 with 2.1.0? generally for new Spark minor version we create a new test profile for it so we would test all supported Spark versions (yes, it could get long)


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    LGTM. Sorry I didn't spot the version number earlier.


Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    Tested and it works well.
    
    Shell we add `spark-2.1` profile  [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/install/build.md#build-profiles) and [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/install/build.md#build-command-examples) ? \cc @AhyoungRyu 
    
    Also shell we use `spark-2.1` profile in [release artifact build](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/dev/create_release.sh#L126) ? \cc @minahlee

    I built with "./dev/change_scala_version.sh 2.11; mvn clean package -Pscala-2.11 -Pspark-2.1" and see the same test failure that Travis saw for the new 2.1.0 build (https://travis-ci.org/apache/zeppelin/jobs/190524013):
    
    Results :
    
    Failed tests:

    Agree with @Leemoonsoo 


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    @ejono I have a following commit to fix the test failure. Could you retry that ?


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    @Leemoonsoo  @AhyoungRyu build.md is updated, but I didn't touch `create_release.sh`, I will left it to @minahlee to decide. 


Github user minahlee commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    We always have been deliver release with the most recent minor spark release, so I think it's better to update release profile to use 2.1.
    @zjffdu It would be appreciated if you can update spark profile in following three lines:
    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/dev/create_release.sh#L126
    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/dev/create_release.sh#L127
    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/dev/publish_release.sh#L47



Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    @minahlee Thanks for help. I have updated these release script. 


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    great, we are good to go then, yeah?
    
    @minahlee btw, should we update the hadoop-2.4 in the release script - we are testing against 2.6 in CI and almost everyone out there should be running at least 2.6??



Github user minahlee commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    @felixcheung Let me update release script in another PR. @zjffdu do you mind to resolve conflict?


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    @minahlee PR is rebased. 


Github user minahlee commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    LGTM. Merge to master and branch-0.7 if there is no more discussion


Github user ejono commented on the issue:

    @zjffdu, I did see your follow-up commit but was already testing from that commit. I'm not sure what was wrong. Wasn't the CI (which hit the same exact error) also building from that commit? If so, it seems that there is still a problem, as CI hasn't passed yet, right?


Github user zjffdu commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    @ejono  CI is not stable, that failure is flaky test.


Github user ejono commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    @zjffdu, ok, thanks for confirming that it's just a flaky test. It seemed like it could have been related, but I did not dig into it. Have you gotten the test to pass when using Spark 2.1.0?


Github user felixcheung commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    hi - are we good with this change? @ejono it looks like CI tests running on Spark 2.1 is passing - is that what you are asking about?


Github user minahlee commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1880
  
    @zjffdu Do you mind to rebase again please? Let me merge once rebase is done.

    @felixcheung, yes, I was referring to PySparkInterpreterTest.testCompletion, which I thought may have been broken in the new Spark 2.1 Travis CI profile because it was broken for that profile but not other profiles, and it was broken for me locally as well when using Spark 2.1. @zjffdu says that it is a flaky test though, so I have no concerns if that's the case.
