This is actually a timeout (which explains why both instances were on jenkins) but the code is trying to be helpful and already catches timeouts, trying to improve the error returned later, but sometimes there is no error, it's just a timeout, and that results in the assertion above.  I have reworked this to catch the case of a timeout and nothing else to rethrow a timeout error explaining what happened [here|https://github.com/driftx/cassandra-dtest/commit/876e93d2052d6f6420915747a4d21f020722edf0] and multiplexed the test [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/1028/workflows/2c56fe0f-37e7-48f2-b563-73772275b6dd/jobs/26975] but unfortunately never hit a timeout.



If it doesn't repro just repro your hypothesis locally. Force the code to throw and see it handles it as expected. I did locally and it worked for me so +1 :-)

Thanks :) Committed.
