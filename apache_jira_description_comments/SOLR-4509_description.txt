By disabling the Apache HTTP Client stale check I've witnessed a 2-4x increase in throughput and reduction of over 100ms.  This patch was made in the context of a project I'm leading, called Yokozuna, which relies on distributed search.

Here's the patch on Yokozuna: https://github.com/rzezeski/yokozuna/pull/26

Here's a write-up I did on my findings: http://www.zinascii.com/2013/solr-distributed-search-and-the-stale-check.html

I'm happy to answer any questions or make changes to the patch to make it acceptable.
