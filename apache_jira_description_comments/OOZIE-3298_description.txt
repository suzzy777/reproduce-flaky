When a MapReduce action is launched from Oozie (OYA), we don't properly fill the external ID field. It gets populated with the YARN id of the LauncherAM, not with the id of the actual MR job. If the MR job is succesfully submitted then fails, it will be treated as a successfully executed action, which is very misleading and can potentially confuse Oozie users.
