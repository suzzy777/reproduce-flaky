To support CEP-10 we require some atomic functionality that modifies the state of a register as part of the transaction. Specifically, we require at least the ability to append a string to another string. Since this is more widely useful, at the same time we also support addition on numeric fields so that users may maintain precise counters using Paxos, should they wish.
