I'm looking at this. I'll try to move a bunch of these mem_limit tests into separate tests that we can skip on S3 and other filesystems with different timing.

IMPALA-7010: don't run memory usage tests on non-HDFS

Moved a number of tests with tuned mem_limits. In some cases
this required separating the tests from non-tuned functional
tests.

TestQueryMemLimit used very high and very low limits only, so seemed
safe to run in all configurations.

IMPALA-7023: Wait for fragments to finish for test_insert.py

The arrangement of tests in test_insert.py changed with
IMPALA-7010, splitting out the memory limit tests into
test_insert_mem_limit(). On exhaustive, the combination
of test dimensions means test_insert_mem_limit() executes
11 different combinations. Each of these statements can
use a large amount of memory and this is not cleaned
up immediately. This has been causing
test_insert_overwrite(), which immediately follows
test_insert_mem_limit(), to hit the process memory limit.

This changes test_insert_mem_limit() to make it wait
for its fragments to finish.
