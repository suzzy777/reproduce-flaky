We have been using maven-surefire-plugin in 2.22.1 and Junit4.13 for our testing. Now we are trying to upgrade junit to junit5 and saw that the r{color:#6a8759}erunFailingTestsCount parameter isn't working with surefire plugin version. I upgraded surefire to 3.0.0.M4 and verified that the failing tests are now being retried. But the issue is flaky tests show up in the report as Failures.
{color}

 

{color:#6a8759}ie. the log shows
{color}
[WARNING] Tests run: 10455, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 993, Flakes: 10
 
But the actual surefire report shows like below

This is blocking our junit5 upgrade task. Can you please provide a fix for this at the earliest? Please let me know if you need anything else from me to help with the investigation.
