I found this issue while investigating the {{TestKSMSQLCli}} failure in [this jenkins report|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/20984/testReport/], the test is supposed to use parameterized class to test both {{LevelDB}} and {{RocksDB}} implementation of metadata stores, however it only tests default {{RocksDB}} case twice.
