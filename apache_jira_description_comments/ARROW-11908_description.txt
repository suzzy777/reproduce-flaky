This is similar to the symptoms seen in ARROW-11717 but it is still happening  intermittently

On two separate PR I see similar failures:
https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9645/checks?check_run_id=2052183132
https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/9647/checks?check_run_id=2051946608

Example failure:

{code}

subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['/build/cpp/debug/flight-test-integration-client', '-host', 'localhost', '-port=41743', '-scenario', 'auth:basic_proto']' died with <Signals.SIGABRT: 6>.

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
