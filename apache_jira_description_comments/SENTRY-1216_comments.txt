    SENTRY-1216: disable sentry ha tests for now; add time out for each test class/method; fix trainsient junit time out issue. (Anne Yu, reviewed by HaoHao).

Sorry for the late response here. I see that this patch changes tests to part1 and part2. [~anneyu] wondering what do these parts correspond to? Are these tests just spilt into two literal parts? If so, what is the motivation?

The test method takes too long to finish. In a smaller box, the test takes even longer. There are a couple of problems:
1. Each test is a single logical concept in the system. http://artofunittesting.com/definition-of-a-unit-test/. One single test case focuses on testing one issue. 
2. If a big test case fails, it's hard to debug which feature it tested fails, one usually has to debug the log. It also might because test data/context gets polluted from previous testing actions. 

We should advocate from now one, 1 test focuses on 1 issue; 1 test class won't include many tests, in that case can finish within a couple of minutes (say no more than 5 mins) from our pre-commit job.
