   @cgivre I'm not really sure what's going on with the travis-ci tests - I reran them a few times but with no luck - my experience with travis over recent years is bad - so I tend to be reluctant to investigate because the issues usually appear to be with travis as opposed to the code

   @pjfanning Would you mind rebasing on current master?  I know @vdiravka did some work on the TravisCI and i'm wondering if your PR just doesn't have that incorporated.  In any event, I'm kind of thinking that the Travis CI is something we may want to drop from Drill.  It seems to be really flaky and wasting a lot of people's time.
