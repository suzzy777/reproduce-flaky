The unit test {{DecayingEstimatedHistogramReservoirTest#testStriping}} is flaky, especially when many tests are running concurrently, because the used thread-pool can still be running when the assertions are tested (i.e. the {{ExecutorService.awaitTermination()}} returned false).

The "fix" is rather a band aid: extend the wait-period to 1 minute, check the return value of {{awaitTermination}} and apply the same change to some other tests that _might_ be affected as well.
