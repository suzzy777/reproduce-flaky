At this point, I believe this is a ZooKeeper issue as I showed by outputting the Zookeeper events as they come in. If you can show that this is Curator, I'd appreciate it. Otherwise, I'll close the issue.

I recreated everything from the trunk version of ZooKeeper and Curator.
I could reproduce the problem described above right away using the Curator API.

I tried to mimic my test case with the ZooKeeper API, basically I created a client with Watcher, and I did a .exists with Watcher as well, but I couldn't reproduce the behavior (flickering of states)
At this point I don't know the Curator API enough to bridge the gap and prove that it comes from Curator or ZooKeeper.

There is a problem somewhere though.
