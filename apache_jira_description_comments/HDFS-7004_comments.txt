Patch attached. Added a new conf key for HDFS and the KMS, updated things to use them (including docs and xml files). Let's see what test-patch thinks.

I missed updating MiniKMS to also use the new conf key. The other test failures are because the native code failed to build, doesn't seem related.

one NIT, in the {{KMSConfiguration.java}} file, the {{KEY_PROVIDER_URI}} value seems to miss {{CONFIG_PREFIX + }}.

+1 after that and jenkins.


Thanks Tucu, new patch fixing that prefix. I also ticked off a few more places that were missing the new config keys, not sure why the previous test-patch run didn't find them.

Looks like we have quite some flaky tests! These all passed for me locally.

Thanks again for reviewing Tucu, I'll commit this shortly.
