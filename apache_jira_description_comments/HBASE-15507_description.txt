It's currently possible to update the table CFs for a replication peer while it's running, but not the peer configuration or data maps introduced as part of custom replication endpoints in HBASE-11367. 

This means that if you have a custom endpoint that depends on some configuration parameter, you have to remove the peer and recreate it in order to change the param. In some use cases that's not possible without risking data loss. 

HBASE-11393, which will consolidate tableCFs in the same znode as the rest of ReplicationPeerConfig, may help here, but with or without it it still seems like there needs to be further work to add update config/data API support to ReplicationAdmin and a callback mechanism to notify the endpoints of config parameter changes.
