    Return a Forwarding View in View Overrides
    
    This ensures that replacing an output will not fail to mark the
    overridden view as produced by the replacement transform.

    Add Pipeline#replaceTransform
    
    This is the base method for Pipeline Surgery. It takes a
    PTransformMatcher and a PTransformOverrideFactory, and replaces all
    matching PTransforms with the result of the Override Factory.

    Add ParDo Matchers to PTransformMatchers
    
    These match Splittable ParDos and ParDos that use State and Timers.

    Use Graph Surgery in the DirectRunner
    
    Remove DirectRunner#apply(). This migrates the DirectRunner to work on a
    runner-agnostic graph.

    [BEAM-1487, BEAM-3016] Address termination correctness issues in BufferingStreamObserver & BeamFnLoggingClient

    The issue with BeamFnLoggingClient is that we can't arriveAndDeregister during termination since
    the onReadyHandler may also arrive at the same time which is why we swap to using forced termination.
    Also, I added code that would guarantee that log messages produced by the thread which is shutting
    down are guaranteed to make it (this was being caught occassionally by the testLogging test).
    
    The BufferingStreamObserver was incorrectly shutting down since it may attempt to enqueue something
    into a full queue with a reading thread that has already exitted for some reason so it would loop
    forever attempting to insert the poison pill.
    
    Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:
    
     - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.
     - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
     - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.
     - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
     - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.
     - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).
