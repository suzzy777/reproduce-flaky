    this seems like a good change. perhaps toJSON etc should be in a common base class to avoid duplications?

    @felixcheung toJson and fromJson is used in both zeppelin-interpreter and zeppelin-zengine. I didn't find a proper place to put the common interface. And actually the interface doesn't not eliminate the code, the sub classes still need to implement `toJson` as not every classes share the same Gson (some class need custom Gson). So I didn't add a common interface. Please help review it.

    @felixcheung @Leemoonsoo  Any more comments on this ? This PR also address the issue in ZEPPELIN-2652. 
    
    Failed test is flaky test. I will address it in #2422

    LGTM. For the next step, how about introducing `JsonSerializable` and `JsonDeserializable` as interfaces?

    @jongyoul Thanks for the review. Copy my comment above.

    I saw it above. It doesn't reduce the code size but I think it will help another contributors understand code well. How do you think of it?

    I am fine to add interface for it. But only `JsonSerializable` can be added, because `fromJson` is static method.  It is some kind of code convention, should be easy to read and understand.
