Indeed, we did not get the numberOfExecutionRetries from the config. I can push a fix for it. As a default perhaps it makes sense for streaming jobs to have a very large value such as Integer maxvalue imho (given that FT is enabled).

    I have committed this fix. If you rebase from master then you should get this change.

That is actually a good question whether we would like to have such a high value in there. That would mean if the user code is flaky and throw Exceptions all the time the job would start over and over again. Hopefully only well tested topologies go into production - but still.

    Added a comment to the JIRA issue, but the suggestion make sense, @senorcarbone. Let me add a bit of doc and merge this.

    great! Thanks for the note. I will rebase once again from master and remove my quickfix

    Thanks @mbalassi! If you merge can you remove the quickfix (2872308)?  It looks like @hsaputra  pushed it already


Github user mbalassi commented on the pull request:

    Sure, rebasing to master does that.

    Indeed, cool. Good to know

    Change looks good, but can you try and stick with the code style of the remaining project?

    Just a minor thing: I vote that PR titles should include some text about what the PR is about, for example like the first commit msg. That way it is easier to figure out what is interesting to review or what has been reviewed already (imagine multiple PRs with only issue numbers).

    @StephanEwen @uce  I definitely agree, thanks for the feedback!

    @gyfora, did you really have to push this so eagerly? 
    
    1. The behaviour is not documented anywhere
    1. Commit b6f183a is just plain useless after the rebase
    1. I stated that I'm merging it and had a version fixing those issues that is currently running on travis

    sorry this was a miscommunication between the three of us
