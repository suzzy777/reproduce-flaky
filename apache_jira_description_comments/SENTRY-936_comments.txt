Thanks [~sravya]. A few comments:
# Add some unit tests for this behavior.
# This seems like a significant behavior change. We have a flag to toggle this mode.
# Just to be clear, with this change the behavior when Sentry Service is unavailable (ie fallback) will be exactly the same as when Sentry service is available?


@Lenni: Just to confirm the behavior of getUser/ getGroup/ getFsPermission
Old behavior:
If in prefix + unmanaged:
- Not stale: defaultProvider
- Stale: hive:hive, 771
If managed : hive:hive, 771

New behavior:
If in prefix + unmanaged: defaultProvider
If managed : hive:hive, 771

1. Will add tests. 
2. Not sure if we ever want to affect unmanaged paths?
3. Yes, behavior is same irrespective of staleness.


Attaching the new patch. Added new unit test.

[~sravya] - That sounds like the desired behavior IMO. Thanks

Test failure seems unrelated. Kicking off another precommit build, will file a JIRA for the flaky test.
