This is another test that sometimes fails on our build machines, although I can't find failures on the riselab jenkins servers. Failure looks like:

{noformat}
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 0 was not greater than 0
      at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:500)
      at org.scalatest.FunSuite.newAssertionFailedException(FunSuite.scala:1555)
      at org.scalatest.Assertions$AssertionsHelper.macroAssert(Assertions.scala:466)

{noformat}

The test fails in about 2s, while a successful run generally takes 15s. Looking at the logs, the receiver hasn't even started when things fail, which points at a race during test initialization.
