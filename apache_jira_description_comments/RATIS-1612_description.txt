In the user mailing list, Riguz Lee has pointed out that, currently, there is no way to start a server as a Listener; see https://lists.apache.org/thread/tt1j3jkogh71k2hvq5gtltwmphxfy736

The reason is that RaftServer.Builder takes a group as a parameter and treat all the peers in the group as voting members.  This is a missing feature.
