I haven't done a thorough review (I'll leave that to Benjamin), but I just noticed one small thing that we should make sure to fix.  The new option name is {{\-\-connect_timeout}}, but {{\-\-connect\-timeout}} would be consistent with the existing options (like {{\-\-no\-color}}).

I've renamed it, thanks Tyler.

I've also rebased and checked that the patch still merges into trunk after the big merge of CASSANDRA-8099.

LGTM

Committed to 2.2 as {{96e7e626424ca0ded713745d28017c4ad4f943c8}} and merged with trunk, thanks.

Since we put the 2.6 python driver into cassandra-2.1, can we put this there too?

Technically it should be possible. 

Anyone objects? 

No objection from me.

Pending CI tests on the 2.1 backport:
* [2.1 dtest|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/thobbs/job/thobbs-CASSANDRA-9601-2.1-dtest/]
* [2.1 testall|http://cassci.datastax.com/view/Dev/view/thobbs/job/thobbs-CASSANDRA-9601-2.1-testall/]

Thanks for backporting Tyler! CI looks OK but I've launched a second dtest job to shake one flaky test (thrift_hsha_test.ThriftHSHATest.test_closing_connections).

I've reviewed the backport, it looks good. 

I've run {{cqlsh_tests/cqlsh_tests.py:TestCqlsh.test_connect_timeout}} locally as it is currently skipped by Jenkins due to the 2.2 since tag and it passed on my box. 

Once this is committed we mustn't forget to change the since tag in the dtest.

Thanks, committed to 2.1 as {{19c00f72125d8a9c0b716264caa33a68cf56741d}}.

I've also update the dtest to make it 2.1+.  Thanks for checking that!
