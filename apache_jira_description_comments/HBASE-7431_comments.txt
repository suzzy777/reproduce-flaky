I think this is a pretty contentious change. Going to commit soon. 

This test also starts *way* to many region servers.
HBaseTestingUtil.ensureSomeNonStoppedRegionServersAvailable is wrong. For each stopped/stopping RegionServer is starts a new one. As RSs are started/stopped there will be many that are just stopping, and this method will create way more running RSs than requested.

Patch that only starts as many RSs as needed.

0.96 patch. The sync part is not necessary there (that code was changed around)

With the latest patch TestSplitTransactionOnCluster creates around 300 threads as opposed to over 1000 before.

The zombie threads are from TestFromClientSide and TestRestartCluster.
So this is looking good. Since nobody is around and this is an uncontentious and test-only change, I am just going to commit this now.
