[~abhishekbafna], can you add a test case for this?

Thanks [~gezapeti]. I think, I will modify the existing test case to cover the scenario.

The test does not fail for me without the fix for it. Isn't this issue affecting only certain Beeline versions?

[~gezapeti] I think the test was running for you because the trimming should beÂ 
{noformat}
String query = getHive2Script(inputDir.toString(), outputDir.toString()).trim();
{noformat}
instead of
{noformat}
String query = getHive2Script(inputDir.toString(), outputDir.toString().trim());
{noformat}
Beeline already fixed this in later versions, see HIVE-10541 (or maybe HIVE-7475) but the test fails me with the version we use.
