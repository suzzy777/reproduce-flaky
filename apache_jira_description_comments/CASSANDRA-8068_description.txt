Currently, the authenticator interface doesn't allow to make a decision according to the client connection properties (especially the client host name or address). 

The idea is to add the interface which extends the current SASL aware authenticator interface with additional method to set the client connection. ServerConnection then could supply the connection to the authenticator if the authenticator implements that interface.
