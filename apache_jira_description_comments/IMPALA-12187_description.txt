There have been a couple Jenkins jobs that have seen a failure on TestEventProcessing.test_event_based_replication() where the test is expecting the truncated table to have zero rows, but instead the table has 100 rows:
{noformat}
metadata/test_event_processing.py:180: in test_event_based_replication
    self.__run_event_based_replication_tests()
metadata/test_event_processing.py:329: in __run_event_based_replication_tests
    assert rows_in_part_tbl_target == 0
E   assert 100 == 0{noformat}
More logs:
{noformat}
truncate table repl_source_tsmyd.part_tbl;

This was seen in a debug core job and a debug erasure coding job. Only for the partitioned table and not the unpartitioned table.

This seems like a symptom that doesn't match the existing flakiness for TestEventProcessing.test_event_based_replication().
