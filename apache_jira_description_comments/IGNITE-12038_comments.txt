[~ascherbakov], I noticed that these are failures related to IGNITE-11867 (not to IGNITE-10078, see [modid link|https://ci.ignite.apache.org/viewModification.html?modId=886764] in the email message), It also seems that [this change|https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/6568/files#diff-99159d8f2c2b01175d16bf9ed46110acL520] lead to the specified failure of "GridCacheRebalancingAsyncSelfTest.testComplexRebalancing", but I didn't check others. Hope it helps somehow in your investigation.

The contribution contains a bunch of fixes related to new partition counter implementation (IGNITE-10078) discovered during private testing.
This also should fix mentioned above tests.

List of fixes:

Fixed issues related to incorrect partition clearing in OWNING state.
Fixed RENTING->EVICTED partition state change prevention.
CheckpointReadLock() may hang during node stop - fixed.
Fixed invalid invalid topology version assertion thrown on PartitionCountersNeighborcastRequest.	
Fixed an issue when cross-cache tx is mapped on wrong primary when enlisted caches have incompatible assignments.
Now transactions will be rolled back if are preparing on invalid primary node.
Stablilized LocalWalModeChangeDuringRebalancingSelfTest.

[~ivan.glukos] could you do review?
