Recently we encountered some issues with the value of failed tasks. After parsing the jhist file, {{JobInfo.getFailedMaps()}} returned 0, but actually there were failures. 

Another minor thing is that you cannot get the number of killed tasks (although this can be calculated).

The root cause is that {{JobUnsuccessfulCompletionEvent}} contains only the successful map/reduce task counts. Number of failed (or killed) tasks are not stored.
