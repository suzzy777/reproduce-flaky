[PR for DTest API|https://github.com/apache/cassandra-in-jvm-dtest-api/pull/30]


Looks good to me.

To put this through CI the snapshot of dtest-api will need to be deployed to ASF's staging maven repo, and the in-tree patch to have an added "throwaway" commit including the ASF's staging maven repo.

Uploaded as https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/cassandra/dtest-api/0.0.12-SNAPSHOT/dtest-api-0.0.12-20220111.195317-1.jar

Thank you [~mck] I merged you PR to my branch - is that ok?

bq. Thank you Michael Semb Wever I merged you PR to my branch - is that ok?

Yup! Feel free then to squash the squash. (And remember to throwaway the throwaway - it's only for CI :)

[~jlewandowski] , could you double check please that the additional test failures compared to trunk are not related to this patch.

yes, will do

I have analyzed the results - actually, given only distributed tests are touched, no other tests could ever be affected by this patch. The only failing distributed tests are from {{CompactionStorageUpgradeTest}}, but those are flaky on trunk as well. Therefore I conclude it does not introduce new failures.


+1

steps to get this out are
# merge dtest-api patch
# cut and vote on dtest-api release
# remove throwaway commit, and merge in-tree patch
