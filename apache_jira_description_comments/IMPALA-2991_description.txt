I was looking at test_spilling and discovered that a significant number of the queries don't actually spill. This may be because of memory usage improvements that we've since made.

We should evaluate these queries and decide whether they provide useful coverage. If so, we should adjust parameters so that they actually spill and then check the runtime profiles to ensure that the expected behaviour occurred.
