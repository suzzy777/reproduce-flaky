The stack trace makes it looks like reverse ip lookup. It uses the default config, which sets the ip to 0.0.0.0. Not sure how I can mock or bypass it. Should I make the address 127.0.0.1?

* Changing the test case to use 127.0.0.1 instead of default 0.0.0.0, to see if this bypassed remote reverse dns lookup.
* Fixing log line in TokenCache.

Resubmitting patch since last one had some jenkins failure.
