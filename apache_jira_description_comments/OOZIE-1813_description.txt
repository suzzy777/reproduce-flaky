People leave their test coordinator and bundle jobs without ever killing them
and they just eat up resources heavily. We should have a service which periodically check for abandoned coords and report/kill them.
We can add multiple logic to this like ( number of consecutive failed/timedout action, total number of failed/timedout action). 

To start with if number of coord action with failed/timedout status > defined value, then coord is considered to be rogue.
