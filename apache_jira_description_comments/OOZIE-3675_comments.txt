The Mockito upgrade introduced unfortunately a lot of constant and intermittent test failures. Hence, I had to adjust the tests based on the results of several iterations and on their reruns to produce a version with a steady outcome. The latest version ( *OOZIE-3675-019.patch* ) satisfies this according to the test results.

May I have a review on that patch set?

Thanks in advance.

[~jmakai] thanks for the effort you made into this change.

I have one minor question: you changed <parallel> test execution from classes to method. Can you please elaborate more on this? Does this change really necessary? If yes, should we explain it in the pom.xml or in a commit message? If latter, can you please share the explanation we can put into the commit message?

 

Thank you

Sure, Dénes,

Without that change we are experiencing the following exception intermittently, which causes flaky tests and sometimes failed tests:
{code:java}
Problems adding Mockito listener.
Listener of type 'MismatchReportingTestListener' has already been added and not removed.
It indicates that previous listener was not removed according to the API.
When you add a listener, don't forget to remove the listener afterwards:
  Mockito.framework().removeListener(myListener);
For more information, see the javadoc for RedundantListenerException class.
{code}
While investigating this issue, I've found we can bypass this by setting <parallel> test execution from classes to methods. According to the test runs, this eliminates the above exception.

I've now explained it in the latest patch set's commit message, and added an additional note to the pom.xml as well.

Could you please review the latest ( *OOZIE-3675-020.patch* ) patch set?

Commit d6d5f1abd540430e54613ef9b5d1b636c2d6d066 in oozie's branch refs/heads/master from Denes Bodo
[ https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=oozie.git;h=d6d5f1abd ]

OOZIE-3675 Upgrade Mockito from 2 to 3.11.2 (jmakai via dionusos)

Additional note:
- Setting the surefire plugin's parallel exeucution mode from `classes` to `methods` in the main pom.xml was necessary in order to prevent Mockito listener related intermtitent failures. (by jmakai)


Thank you [~jmakai] for the contribution. Your change is merged into the master branch.

Thank you very much [~dionusos] :)
