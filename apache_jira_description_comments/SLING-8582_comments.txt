[~rombert] Do you know why there was no Jenkins Build triggered for the PR from Jörg?

Not sure [~kwin]. Looking at https://builds.apache.org/job/Sling/job/sling-org-apache-sling-event/indexing/console the build was not triggered. I also don't see a matching event at https://builds.apache.org/job/Sling/computation/console , but that might've just been too far back to still see it.

Note that you can always manually trigger a scan from https://builds.apache.org/job/Sling/job/sling-org-apache-sling-event/ ( _Scan Repository Now_ ) in case you detect an inconsistency.

If we start seeing systemic issues we should raise a Jira with the ASF Infra team.

The Sonar check passed: https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-event/pull/6/checks?check_run_id=168894067

I did a second push to address some sonar findings, but I don't see that a new sonar scan has been triggered :(

I triggered the build once manually but for the second commit it hasn't been triggered again. I have opened https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-18750 to track this.

I updated the PR again, had to switch to the Sling parent 35 to get proper Java8 support. Ready to get merged.

 

Updated the PR to the latest master and merged it.
