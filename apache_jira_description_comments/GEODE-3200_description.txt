ServerConnection has a private member called authzRequest that is no longer used.

ServerConnection.getAuthzRequest() is used in a few places, but may not be relevant anymore.

authzRequest should be removed or used to cache the value if it can be cached, and we should probably have a look at getAuthzRequest to make sure it's still used.

This class is expected to undergo significant refactoring due to GEODE-3074, you might want to have a chat with whoever is working on that to avoid merge conflicts.
