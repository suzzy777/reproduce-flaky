ZooKeeper will most likely add support for "Container" nodes per https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2163 - Curator must support this feature

* Backwards compatible to 3.4.6. If Containers are available, theyâ€™re used in all recipes that create parent nodes.
* The use of EnsurePath is now deprecated
