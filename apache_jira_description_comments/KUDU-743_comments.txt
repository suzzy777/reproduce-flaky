Indeed it looks like something's happening client side such that the ops get into the batch in inverted order. The WAL after the test failure says:

0.2@5863716376178253824	REPLICATE WRITE_OP
	Tablet: 9e0fbf9717c94b19abe7f713bb775406
	Consistency: NO_CONSISTENCY
	op 0: MUTATE (int32 key=1) SET int_val=2
	op 1: INSERT (int32 key=1, int32 int_val=1, string string_val=, int32 non_null_with_default=12345)


Put up a patch to fix this at http://gerrit.sjc.cloudera.com:8080/6645

[~jdcryans] is it possible we need to do this fix in the java side too? Perhaps we should add a similar test to java?

[~tlipcon] just wrote a test, it triggers pretty quickly too.

k. I sorta wonder whether asynchbase has the same issue when writing to HBase, and whether anyone's ever noticed. Would be helpful to evaluate priority of fixing (is it complicated to fix in the java side?)

C++ side fix is committed. Java side is pending at http://gerrit.sjc.cloudera.com:8080/#/c/6650/
