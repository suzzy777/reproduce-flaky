There seems to be a problem with the logging of leader election times: the logged times are much smaller than the actual time it took for the leader election to complete.

This bug can be easily reproduced by following these steps:

1) Run a ZK cluster of 3 servers

2) Kill the server that is currently the leader

3) The log files of the remaining 2 servers contain false leader election times

 

In the attached files you can see the log files of the remaining 2 serve. For brevity, I removed the parts before and after the leader election from the log files.

For example, in {{server1.txt}} we can see that:

 
{code:java}

Leader election supposedly took only 1ms, but in reality it took (32,272 - 31,853) = 419ms!

The reason for this bug seems to be the introduction of this line
{code:java}
start_fle = Time.currentElapsedTime();{code}
(seen here [https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumPeer.java#L1402]) 

back in this commit [https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/commit/5428cd4bc963c2e653a260c458a8a8edf3fa08ef].
