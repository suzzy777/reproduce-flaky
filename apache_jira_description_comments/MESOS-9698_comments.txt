It looks like this failure occurs because two {{ReconcileOperationsMessages}} are sent from the master to the agent for the same operation. This leads to two OPERATION_DROPPED updates for the same operation; after the first one is processed by the master, the operation is removed. Then, when the second one is received, we hit [this block|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/3a0c2fa2ae338eeab292e7c0d3dae55b66f5886d/src/master/master.cpp#L8817-L8836] and incorrectly assume that the framework ID is SOME.
