New type of build {{TIDY}} has been added in 4e2451dbf.  Sent an e-mail to dev@kudu.apache.org: awaiting for feedback for the proposition to run the kudu-tidy-bot job only on the patches targeted for the master branch.  If no feedback comes in a day, I'm going to implement the proposal as described and resolve this issue as fixed.

Just going to noteÂ that the email to dev@ was filtered as spam for me.

Fixed with {{4e2451dbf18db1faf9545ac1f9663d378b9f5efe}} and configuration change for the {{kudu-tidy-bot}} Jenkins job at {{jenkins.kudu.apache.org}}:

{noformat}
... skipped ...

export BUILD_TYPE=TIDY
build-support/jenkins/build-and-test.sh
{noformat}

Also, the {{kudu-tidy-bot}} job's configuration has been updated to run against the master branch only.

Just for the record, another alternative for the script was the following:

{noformat}
... skipped ...

if [[ $GERRIT_BRANCH =~ branch-(0\.[[:digit:]]+|1\.[0-8])(\.[[:alnum:]]+.*)?$ ]]; then
  thirdparty/build-if-necessary.sh

  # HACK HACK HACK: this will do the build, but then fail before it runs any tests.
  # Need to add a 'build-only' mode to build-and-test.
  # We have to build so that protobuf stuff is generated.
  RUN_FLAKY_ONLY=1 build-support/jenkins/build-and-test.sh || :

  build-support/clang_tidy_gerrit.py HEAD
else
  export BUILD_TYPE=TIDY
  build-support/jenkins/build-and-test.sh
fi
{noformat}

The idea was to keep the job running at all related branches (with the configured regex for the branch name as it was before: {{^(?!gh-pages$).*}}), where the new way of running the job would be applied only to the branches where changelist {{861ecc12f}} is present.  However, current development patterns for the Kudu project make it enticing to switch to simpler model, where the {{kudu-tidy-bot}} job is run against the changes in the {{master}} branch only.
