I think your root cause may not be here, we never seem to have this problem during our downline process.

Thanks [~it_singer] , you are correct in that my initial root cause was incomplete

In the past few months I have seen this issue re-occur multiple times, I decided to do a deeper dive & I identified the bug described here: [https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/4410]

I think the issue described in this ticket is occurring because the corrupt replica on DN3 will not be invalidated until DN3 either:
 * restarts & sends a block report
 * sends its next periodic block report (default interval is 6 hours)

So in the worst case the decommissioning in the aforementioned scenario will take up to 6 hours to complete because DN3 may take up to 6 hours to send its next block report & have the corrupt replica invalidated. I have not targeted fixing this decommissioning blocker scenario because it is arguably expected behavior & will resolve in at most "dfs.blockreport.intervalMsec". Instead the fix [[https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/4410]] is targeting a more severe bug where decommissioning gets blocked indefinitely

Merged the PR into trunk and branch-3.3.

Cherry-picked to branch-3.2.
