   @ArkenKiran - Looks like there are test failures (an NPE) with PhoenixIndexRpcSchedulerTest. Could you please take a look?

   Test results for 2nd build: https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/Phoenix/job/Phoenix-PreCommit-GitHub-PR/job/PR-1356/2/testReport/
   
   Btw this PR and Jira title can be changed to "Replace deprecated getCall with updated getRpcCall" because method not found seems un-relevant.
   And I will trigger one more build to ensure the recent failed tests are not repetitive (although they are known flakies).

   @kiran-maturi could you also create another PR against 5.1 branch? That way we will have all tests run in 5.1 as well, and once done, both PRs can be merged together.
