I think this is not related to local catalog mode but an issue of the event processor. I can't reproduce the issue if I keep the event processor disabled:
{code:java}
 bin/start-impala-cluster.py --impalad_args --use_local_catalog=true --catalogd_args --catalog_topic_mode=minimal{code}
The reason why we don't see this in the legacy catalog mode is that DDLs are executed much faster in local catalog mode.

BTW, this seems a similar sympton with IMPALA-10502. [~vihangk1] has a patch for it and it's under review: [https://gerrit.cloudera.org/c/17308/]. It probably fixes this issue as well.

Thanks, [~stigahuang]. I'll keep an eye on IMPALA-10502 and check if that fixes this issue as well.

Hi [~boroknagyz] , is the issue resolved now?

Thanks [~stigahuang], I cannot reproduce this issue anymore.
