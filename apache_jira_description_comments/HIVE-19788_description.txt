{{TestHCatLoaderComplexSchema}} is still flaky because its writing to {{/tmp/}} - HIVE-19731 was meant to fix this, and that fixes the tmp dir for any Hive queries, but these tests run a bunch of Pig queries too, and those queries write to {{/tmp/}} - we need to pass in custom configs to the embedded {{PigServer}} that is being created as part of these tests.
