Thanks for reporting this. The test failure you're experiencing is already fixed in FLINK-21104. Rebasing your branch should solve the issue.

Thanks for response. I'll rebase my branch. And is there any way to test whether it works on my local environment?

You could run the test locally using {{mvn -pl flink-tests test -Dtest=UnalignedCheckpointITCase}}. Alternatively, you could run the test {{org.apache.flink.test.checkpointing.UnalignedCheckpointITCase}} from within your IDE. Intellij has a feature where you can run this test until a failure occurs. This might be handy since the {{UnalignedCheckpointITCase}} is flaky (i.e. does not fail regularly) recently.

But just rebasing your branch should be enough. Without knowing all the details I would suspect that the failure is unrelated to your changes.
