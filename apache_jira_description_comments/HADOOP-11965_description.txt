Running determine-flaky-tests against PreCommit-HDFS-Build generates just slightly under 10,000 lines of output.  That's significantly too much to be useful for the casual user.  It's also not formatted in such a way to be easily machine parseable to generate a decent report.  A summary mode should be added that just prints out the top X failed tests.
