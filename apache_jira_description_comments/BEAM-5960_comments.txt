Rolled it back

[~kenn], it is true that the SMOKE suite iterates over the members of NexmarkQueryName so the new query gets automatically included to the SMOKE suite and thus it is run as part of nexmark postcommits. What is the postCommit failure?

[~kenn] also I noticed on your PR that the new query does not have a number so the BQ table will be named with a string in it. It is not coherent with the existing naming of the other tables but it is not a big deal because this naming is still there only for backward compatibility with the dashboards. WDYT?

It was postCommit failure because the {{main()}} codepath didn't set up the side input. I was going to do that in a separate step, but I didn't realize it would automatically start running. I added a new precommit test that will catch it.

As for number vs name, maybe let's discuss on the rollforward PR https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/6933. Personally, I think the numbers are not great since if we actually get a big suite of benchmarks, we are going to need to use names to keep track of them. So the numbers are just for compatibility with the dashboards and to make the historical perf numbers match up.


I agree, name is a lot better to numbers. Let's stick with that. We just need to remember it when adding the dashboards graphs for the new query.
