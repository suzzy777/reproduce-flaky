There are several errors in DataNucleus O-R mapping file, package.jdo, which are not complained by the existing DN version. These errors may be subject to future DN complaint (as experienced in HIVE-3632 and HIVE-2084). However, it is still better if we fix these errors as it also creates some confusion in the community.
