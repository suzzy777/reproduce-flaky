Phoenix uses an old maven-checkstyle-plugin version, and accordingly an old checker.xml file.

This checker.xml file is not understood by recent checkstyle versions, including the one used by the current eclipse checkstyle plugin, so (at least) eclipse checkstyle integration has stopped working.

Updating to the latest maven-checkstyle-plugin, and updating the checkstyle config files accordingly solves this problem.
