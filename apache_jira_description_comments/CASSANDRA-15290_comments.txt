I don't see any related failures, +1 from me.

I guess performance impact of the unnecessary token cache invalidation is negligible, so we do not need to backport it as a perf bug fix to 4.0 and older versions. Please, correct me if I'm wrong.

+1 (non binding)

Committed, thanks!

Hi guys, I noticed a spike in trunk CI failures and if my bisect kung-fu was good enough TokenMetadataTest is flaky at {{b1e77ba}} but not on the previous one {{bd406c7}}. It can be repro'ed locally by running the test a few times.

Thanks, I created CASSANDRA-17007 to tackle this.
