My guess is that this is the same hang as IMPALA-6351

Consolidating RHEL7 hangs that we think are due to the same kernel futex bug

Here is another example of this issue from a recent run (krpc tests)-- not the same kernel as the rhel7 tests. Re-opening since the kernel bug does not explain this one afaict.Â

Marking the build as aborted.*02:53:54* Build was aborted

I'll see if I can reproduce locally.

No luck reproducing.

We don't have anything actionable right now, so we'll close and reopen if we have some clues. We should make sure to collect logs, etc, next time if we see it.

I saw this today on an exhaustive build on CentOS 7.

I'm not going to have a chance to look at this immediately, unassigning in case someone else can pick up.

IMPALA-6352: Dump backtrace on failure of TestTableSample

TestTableSample is a flaky test which has been failing very rarely due
to a possible hung thread. Therefore this patch adds a timeout to the
test and logs the backtrace of all impalads if timeout occurs, so we
can get more information on the state of those threads.

ran into this on a core asan build today.

-Ran into a hang that looks like this on a live system and took pstacks of the impalads. They are attached.-

Looks unrelated, nothing running

[~bikramjeet.vig] is this still critical? 

[~tarmstrong] don't think so, haven't seen this in a while and had no luck reproducing it locally. I am working on a patch that will print the stack trace before it times out, so we ll get some more info if this happens again
