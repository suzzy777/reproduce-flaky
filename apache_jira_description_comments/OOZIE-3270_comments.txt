Although there are no junit test failures I'm having difficulties with running spark actions after the derby bump. Please hold with this patch

The last patch seems to be working on real clusters as well.
I also did some housekeeping and consolidated the SecurityManager usage in our tests.

Thanks for the contribution [~gezapeti]! The patch looks good, I really like the way you did a bit of test code cleanup and consolidation as well.

A few thoughts:
 * please fix remaining {{FINDBUGS_DIFF}} and {{COMPILE}}Â problems from latest pre-commit build run
 * nit: {{TestOozieDBCLI:229-232}} could be extracted to {{LauncherSecurityManager#checkAndLogExitCode()}} and be reused a couple of times
 * {{AllowAllPolicy}} could be tested to allow for a basic understanding on its usage
 * {{AG_ActionConfiguration.twiki}} or {{AG_Install.twiki}} could be extended to have a better understanding on security aspects of {{LauncherAM}}

Thanks for the review!

I'll fix the findbugs/javac stuff.

I can see that there is still place to improve around CLI tests, but I don't want to do that as part of this task. Also, I don't like the idea of moving test helper functions to production code.

I'll think about a test for AllowAllPolicy. I'm not sure it will have much to test for.

I think the best place to add some documentation about this is http://oozie.apache.org/docs/5.0.0/WorkflowFunctionalSpec.html#a3.2.1.2_Actions_Are_Asynchronous I'll write a couple sentences there about what's happening.

Thanks [~gezapeti] for the updated patch! Looks really good, thanks for the documentation update.

The only remaining issue I see is that {{AllAllPolicyTest}} should be named {{TestAllowAllPolicy}} instead.
