We started seeing Python DTest failures that point to Jolokia agent. 

In  [one|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/jacek-lewandowski/cassandra/237/workflows/b9eb4a84-b30c-4fd5-9ca9-ea47f114eef0/jobs/1654/tests] of the latest J11 runs I noticed: 
{code:java}
stdout = b"WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred\nWARNING: Illegal reflective access by org.jolokia.jvma...rt '8778' is already occupied.\nPlease check the standard output of the target process for a detailed error message.\n" stderr = None, retcode = 1{code}
I checked Jolokia  [official page|https://jolokia.org/] and it seems they added the Java 11 support with 1.7 and we are on 1.6 yet.

So I suspect this might be our solution. To be investigated.
