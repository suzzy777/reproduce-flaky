Tried to write a simple Java client again 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.

* Write 1M rows, each row with 1 family, and 10 qualifiers (values [0-9]), for a total of 10M cells written
* Read back the data from the table, ensure I saw 10M cells

Running it against {{04ac1891}} (and earlier) yesterday, I would get ~20% of the actual rows. Running against 1.0.0, returns all 10M records as expected.

[Code I was running|https://github.com/joshelser/hbase-hwhat/blob/master/src/main/java/hbase/HBaseTest.java] for the curious.
