The test passes 100% reliably on MacOS, but it does fail for me in my Ubuntu VM just as it does with Jenkins.

Don't yet know why the difference is there, but I'll deal with it.

A simple patch [here|https://github.com/iamaleksey/cassandra-dtest/commits/13842].

The problem with the tests is that they don’t take into account the full behaviour of batchlog replay. In particular,
batchlog will *not* replay a batch if it’s younger than 2 times write rpc timeout. The reasoning for this is that
there is a good chance that the batch can still succeed up until that point and be removed by the remote coordinator -
thus avoiding redundant replay. 2 * timeout is there for batched mutations timeout + remove from batchlog mutation
timeout.

One way to fix this would be to introduce a special argument to batchlog replay methods that would ignore the check and
replay everything it has, ignoring that optimisation. But on 3.0 it has correctness implications, since we store last replayed
batch id as the lower bound for the next replay cycle. In 2.2 it’s a bit safer, but we need it to be addressed in both versions -
and I’m not comfortable with making such changes in minor releases.

The other way to fix it is by introducing a deterministic delay to age the batches by 2 * timeout. It adds 20 extra seconds per test,
for a total of 40 seconds, but I don’t see a better way unfortunately. Shouldn’t be flaky however.

P.S. The reason it passes on MacOS and fails on Linux is that the test runs very, very slowly on MacOS. 160+ seconds vs. 30 seconds on Linux.
It naturally has just enough time for the batch to age, so when we force its replay, it is replayed reliably.
