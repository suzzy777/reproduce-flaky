test embedded ES server is in bad health. Overloaded jenkins once again? This time there is no point increasing timeouts. Maybe waiting for at least yellow status of ES before each test could be good.

This issue is P2 but has been unassigned without any comment for 60 days so it has been labeled "stale-P2". If this issue is still affecting you, we care! Please comment and remove the label. Otherwise, in 14 days the issue will be moved to P3.

Please see https://beam.apache.org/contribute/jira-priorities/ for a detailed explanation of what these priorities mean.


There were recent overload counter measures on ES tests and there was no flaky tests since. Closing this issue.
