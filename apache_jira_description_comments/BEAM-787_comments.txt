I'm able to reproduce this locally in a few seconds when looping the test in IntelliJ. Looking.

I think I found the bug:

https://github.com/apache/incubator-beam/blob/master/runners/direct-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/direct/ExecutorServiceParallelExecutor.java#L268 - handleResult() applies state updates, including updating the watermark.
And *only after that* at lines 269 and onwards, we commit output bundles.
If the watermark refreshes itself in the meantime, output elements may be rejected by LateDataDroppingDoFnRunner.

The sad part is, I'm not sure how to fix this. Ideally we should apply state updates atomically with output bundles instead. Will look tomorrow.

Will be fixed by https://github.com/apache/incubator-beam/pull/1261, though I want to separately add tests that would have made the failure deterministic rather than flaky.
