    [ZEPPELIN-1876] smart psql autocomplition

    ### What is this PR for?
    This PR changes autocompletion behaviour in postgresql interpeter.
    There are some changes:
    * [main change] autocompletion now depends on what are you typing. Now there are four types of competion: schema, table, column and keywords. If you typing new word then autocompetion suggests only keywords and schema names. If you are typing after schema name with point then you get list of tables in that schema. Also if you typing a name after point after a table name you will get a list of column names of this table.
    * autocomption now supports aliases in sql. If you write alias for a table you will get a list of columns of an aliased table if you write down the alias and a point.
    * new option are availble for postgresql interpreter: postgresql.completer.schema.filter. It allows filter schema names loaded into autocompletion (no more garbage schema names).
    * autocompletion now load keywords only in low case (otherwise there are so many keywords in a list of autocompletion that it is becomes uncomfortable)
    
    ### What type of PR is it?
    Improvement
    
    ### Todos
    * [ ] - sort names in the output of autocompletion
    * [ ] - list only schema names if we are typing a schema name (for example after keywork FROM)
    * [ ] - add description in autocompletion list for schema names - schema, for table names - table and so

    Looks like CI error does not have any relation with my PR. Could anyone confirm that?

    @sotnich Thanks for the contribution. We, however, merged all functions of PSQLInterpreter into JDBCInterpreter and will remove PSQLInterpreter sooner. I'm very happy to adopt this function into JDBCInterpreter. Do you mind handling it?


Github user sotnich commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1828
  
    @jongyoul , sure, I will do it. I'll close this PR and will open a new one.

    @astroshim Could you please review this PR?


Github user sotnich commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1886
  
    Don't think CI errors are related to this PR.


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1886
  
    There is a flaky test in the result:
    
    ```
    WelcomePageSuite
    ```
    
    Never mind the result. that test is being fixed now. LGTM


Github user jongyoul commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1886
  
    @sotnich Can you rebase it onto current master? Recently, we fixed some flaky tests including your case. It would make your CI green


Github user sotnich commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1886
  
    Made a rebase, now CI tests have only one error related with DistributedResourcePoolTest.
    Think it's still not related to my PR.


Github user cloverhearts commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1886
  
    @sotnich 
    I was test.
    LGTM.
    
    I have a question.
    Is it possible to only support pgsql? (actually, i am mysql/maria user)


Github user sotnich commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1886
  
    @cloverhearts 
    Please, clirify your question.
    This PR supports every JDBC driver that can return schema and table names.
    I have tested it on postgres, but I am sure it would correctly run on mysql and other relational databases.


Github user astroshim commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1886
  
    @sotnich Thank you for great improvement.
    I tested `mysql` and `postgresql` and only `postgresql` is working expectedly like @cloverhearts.


Github user Leemoonsoo commented on the issue:

    CI failure is not related to this change.
    LGTM and merge to master if no further discussion.


Github user sotnich commented on the issue:

    @cloverhearts @astroshim 
    Made a little change - now mysql also works as well as postgresql. I have tested it.


Github user astroshim commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1886
  
    @sotnich Great Job! but still doesn't work with `mysql`.

    Hello, I was check again.

    Is there anything I missed?

    @cloverhearts @astroshim, check it now, please. If it's still not working send me details: configuration of the interpreter and jdbc log file.
