Per the discussion in [HDFS-10971|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-10971?focusedCommentId=15567108&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15567108] I would like to add a new API {{isErasureCoded()}} to {{FileStatus}} so that tools and downstream applications can tell if it needs to treat a file differently.

Hadoop tools that can benefit from this effort include: distcp and teragen/terasort.
Downstream applications such as flume or hbase may also benefit from it.
