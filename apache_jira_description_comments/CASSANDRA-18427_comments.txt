[Here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/driftx/cassandra/955/workflows/ad33d42f-fa93-4331-b716-68d01138e324/jobs/19120] is 500 runs in circle (against trunk, which may be correct?) that unsurprisingly did not reproduce.  I believe this was just a timeout, since the record with a TTL of 5 is not present, but the one with the longer TTL of 1000 is.

Resolving as cannot repro.
