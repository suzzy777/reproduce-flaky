Add a Http Server Component for Bookkeeper.

It would be great that Bookkeeper can have an Http Server to expose some useful APIs. We can expose and manage the server status, server configuration, lifecycle states, query or trigger auto recovery through HTTP Endpoint, or even trigger GC and compaction over Http Endpoint.

This ticket is mainly to add a Http framework for Bookkeeper, so that we can extend more useful APIs based on the existing Http framework.
