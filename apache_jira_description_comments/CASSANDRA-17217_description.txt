The testÂ {{org.apache.cassandra.distributed.test.trackwarnings.LocalReadSizeWarningTest#failThresholdSinglePartition}} seems to be flaky.

It was discovered during CASSANDRA-17195 with [this CI run|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1217/workflows/b366e352-0862-485a-acdc-5b75fe1ef575/jobs/11188].

The failure can be reproduced running the test repeatedly for trunk, as it can be seen [here|https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/adelapena/cassandra/1219/workflows/a0c1fb7f-8a07-4fcf-97a4-7caf207dad78].
