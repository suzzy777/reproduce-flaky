[~mmulder], was this with an ASAN enabled build?

No.

raising the priority because this is showing up in recent builds and we need to purge flaky tests

[~zamsden] can you look at this?

Maybe we should remove this test? I'm not sure if it's worth adding in intelligence to consider context switches? I don't know what coverage this provides that we think we really need.
[~dhecht] what do you think?

This should be fixable with getrusage().  We can discard results when involuntary context switches goes too high as well to eliminate flake runs when there is CPU pressure on the machine.

I don't have a strong feeling either way. If it's easy and reliable to use getrusage() that's fine. Or deleting the test is also fine.

But I wonder why this is now failing. We run backend tests single threaded with nothing else, right?  Maybe it's just another example of jenkins deploying multiple jobs to the same machine, or something?

I didn't see any other jobs running at the same time. We saw it happen twice over the last 2 weeks so it seems unlikely to be that, especially since this is a fast test. I don't have a better theory though :(
