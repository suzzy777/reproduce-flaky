Looks like a timing problem when the machine is under heavy load.

Agree, this is a real issue; I'm not convinced adding timing based checks here is good for the Travis CI build system either.  They should probably be removed.  I'm sure the intention was to find poorly performing code paths, however that should be done with callgrind, not with a unit test.

I would say this is fixed on master
