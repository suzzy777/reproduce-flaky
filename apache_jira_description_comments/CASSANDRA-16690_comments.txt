It shows again passed when I open the link. If I search in the runs I found it failed with cdc once.
But then I ran it with Java 8 and Java 11 1000 times and nothing so I close as not  reproducible.....

Please reopen if by chance you see it again

Stage test reports don't do the fail/pass/fail thing: https://ci-cassandra.apache.org/job/Cassandra-4.0-test-cdc/47/jdk=jdk_11_latest,label=cassandra,split=8/testReport/junit/org.apache.cassandra.utils.memory/NativeAllocatorTest/testBookKeeping_cdc/

Did you try looping locally?

Yes, I  did...

Ok, failed again in Jenkins...

:( 

BUT here a tiny patch comes. 

I think that the time of 10ms probably sometimes it is not enough for the cleaner. I raised the time to 20 MILISECONDS plus added an assertion [here|https://github.com/ekaterinadimitrova2/cassandra/pull/136/commits/3888fbace8ae96ab0426853d2583d5adc62a5d97]. I was not able to reproduce the issue but my assumption is based on reviewing the code. 

[~adelapena] or [~maedhroz], does anyone of you have the time to look at this, please? As you were reviewing my changes in that area of the code at the beginning of the year. This wasn't a new test added but somehow related. 

Thank you in advance. I can't reproduce the issue locally, CircleCI Multiplexer and in our company Jenkins multiplexer. I just pushed a CI run in cassandra Jenkins, dev - [https://jenkins-cm4.apache.org/job/Cassandra-devbranch/851/] I suggest we push the commit if there is no failure in Jenkins. 

[~e.dimitrova] sure, I can review

Thanks [~adelapena]! In the meanwhile, the Jenkins run finished and I don't see the test failing...at least in this run.

It's easy to repro adding a Thread.sleep() before {{isClean.countDown()}} in the cleaner code. Adding the assertion, to check for a successful clean, and raising the wait timeout is the way to go +1. But I would raise it to 500ms or so, then we won't have to fight this again the day we timeout on 20ms. At the end of the day that timeout being high has no semantics.

Agree, raising the timeout and adding the assertion looks good to me. I would also raise the timeout, perhaps to even longer than 500ms since we have seen longer pauses in CircleCI, maybe something like 5-10 seconds to be on the safe side. I think that the patch should also be applied to 3.0 and 3.11, since those branches also have the 10ms timeout.

Thank you both, I will apply the patch to 3,3.11 and 4 with the suggested raised timeout of 10 seconds.

Pushed to all branches after I ran successfully locally the test on all branches:
