[~ewohlstadter] could you take a look?

Actually this seems be consistently failing: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/11412/testReport/org.apache.hive.jdbc/TestJdbcWithMiniLlapArrow/testDataTypes/

Has been failing for 8 builds

I have reverted HIVE-19723 which was causing the issue.
