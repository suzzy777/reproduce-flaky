The test {{RemoteExecutionTest#testExecutionWithMultipleStages}} is not related to the Flink Runner. The PortableTimerTest is another issue, see BEAM-6111. The first could however be related to the flakiness of the latter.

Hey Kenneth, can you please check if this is still occurring, or please re-assign.

Not sure how that ended up on me. I don't have insight here, just noticed the flaking.
