Currently, when a Namenode is in safemode(under starting or enter safemode manually), we can transfer this Namenode to Observer by command. This Observer node may receive many requests and then throw a SafemodeException, this causes unnecessary failover on the client.

So Namenode in safe mode should not be transfer to observer state.
