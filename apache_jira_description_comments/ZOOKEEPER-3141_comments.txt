[~lvfangmin] Do you want to take a look at this flaky test introduced by your patch in ZOOKEEPER-3109?

Thanks [~hanm] for reporting the issue, I'll take a look today.

[~hanm] I checked out internal continuous build, and didn't see it's flaky, also tried to continuously running this test on my MAC, haven't seen any failure so far.

Checked the log, since it's failing because we cannot resolve the address:

Looks like an environment issue, did we see this kind of issue before?

The address `fee.fii.foo.fum` was from another test case in same file: [testBadPeerAddressInQuorum|
https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumPeerMainTest.java#L597]. One possibility is apache Jenkins was running multiple test cases and for some reasons, one test case (testBadPeerAddressInQuorum) interferes the other (testLeaderElectionWithDisloyalVoter_stillHasMajority). I've seen some flaky tests caused by interference between test cases, but this one is new to me.

I set up a stress test on apache jenkins just to run testLeaderElectionWithDisloyalVoter_stillHasMajority alone and if the failure does not reproduce then it's likely the interferences between test cases are the cause. 


The failure does not reproduce in my stress test job which just ran this single test (https://builds.apache.org/job/Zookeeper_UT_sTRESS/). It can be reproduced on nightly build on trunk. Likely caused by interference from another test case. 

[~hanm] where can I found the nightly build result, I can take a look into this to find out why it's being interfered.

Thanks [~lvfangmin], appreciate your help on fixing this.

To identify a build where this test fail, you can start at flaky test dashboard:

[https://builds.apache.org/job/zOOkeeper-Find-Flaky-Tests/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/report.html] 

You will see this test is currently ranking as one of the top flaky tests. Then click the show/hide label of the right most column it will expand and list the builds. 

Currently, these builds can be used to triage

[179|https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk//179]   [181|https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk//181]   [189|https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk//189]

I checked the most recent builds and this test doesn't seem to me flaky. Are you still working on it or shall we close it?

[~andor] we verified this is due to interfered, not the testLeaderElectionWithDisloyalVoter itself, I hadn't worked on this after that, glad to see that this is not flaky anymore.

I'll close this Jira, will open a new one if it starts flaky again.

Reopen this issue because this test was observed similar symptom recently as reported  in ZOOKEEPER-3124 [https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-github-pr-build/2901/testReport/junit/org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum/QuorumPeerMainTest/testLeaderElectionWithDisloyalVoter/].
