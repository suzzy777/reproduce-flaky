[~gaoyunhaii] I saw you have contributed to this code – do you have any insights?

Hi [~ibzib] very thanks for reporting the issue! What flink version is the test running towards ? 

This sounds like a duplicate issue of FLINK-23201?

CC [~akalashnikov]

We've observed this failure on Flink 1.12.4 and 1.13.1. It does indeed look like a dupe of FLINK-23201, thanks for checking.

Thanks for the confirmation. Ok, closing this duplicate for now.
