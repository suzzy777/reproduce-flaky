        if ((nativeFlag != null && Boolean.parseBoolean(nativeFlag)) || (nativeFlag == null && DatabaseDescriptor.startNativeTransport()))
        {
            startNativeTransport();
            StorageService.instance.setRpcReady(true);
        } {code}
The startup code here only sets RpcReady if native transport is enabled. If you call 
{code:java}
nodetool enablebinary{code}
then this flag doesn't get set.

But with the change from CASSANDRA-13043 it requires RpcReady set to true in order to get a leader for the counter update.

Not sure what the correct fix is here, seems to only really use this flag for counters. So thinking perhaps the fix is to just move this outside the if condition.
