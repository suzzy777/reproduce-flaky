Pushed branch with the fixes [here|https://github.com/pcmanus/cassandra/commits/10073] (I'll update with links to CI results once/if the branch is picked up by cassci).

The reason for the exception is that {{CollectionType.validateCellValue}} is not calling the proper validation method for it's values (it should call their {{validateCellValue}}). This is not a particularly new bug, but the only types for which {{validate}} and {{validateCellValue}} differs are collections (but we don't support nested collections) and counters (for which, prior to CASSANDRA-8099 were never part of collections -- they can be now if counters are used in thrift super columns). The first commit fixes that.

Once that was fixed, the test was still failing due to some pretty clear typo in {{ColumnSubselection}} serialization code, so a 2nd commit fixes that too.

CI results: [utests|http://cassci.datastax.com/job/pcmanus-10073-testall/1/] and [dtests|http://cassci.datastax.com/job/pcmanus-10073-dtest/1/].

Compared to the last results on the cassandra-3.0 branch:
* for the unit tests, there is a failure of {{org.apache.cassandra.cql3.MaterializedViewLongTest.testConflictResolution}} but I can't really imagine how the patch here could in any way influence that test so I strongly suspect a flaky test.
* for the dtests, it fixes the test of the description as expected (in fact, the run has only 27 failures compared to 33 on the last cassandra-3.0 run, but the rest is probably flaky tests for which the run got lucky).
