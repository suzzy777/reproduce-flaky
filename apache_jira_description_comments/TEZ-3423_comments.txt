[~amita-persistent] Thanks for reporting the issue. Are these 2 tests consistently failing or just flaky? 

[~hitesh] I am getting consistent failures.

[~sseth] [~aplusplus] Was something similar fixed in master and possibly not backported to 0.7.x? 

This is still the dispatcher race condition. Was that patch committed to branch-7?

Nothing rings a bell. Maybe we should run a daily / weekly test run on the other branches.

[~aplusplus] mind providing a patch for branch 0.7 for TEZ-2852? 

Patch uploaded in TEZ-2852.

[~amita-persistent] Mind trying out the patch first and letting us know if it resolves the issue in your build env? 

[~hitesh] Sure, I will try the patch TEZ-2852 and will update the status.

[~hitesh] The above error is not occurring anymore, thanks for the patch. But there is still a failure for "Running org.apache.tez.test.TestDAGRecovery" . As I am new to use TEZ ,not sure if it is anywhere related to the above or it is independent failure. Failure detail is as below:

Was searching on JIRA, seems like my issue is same as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TEZ-2673 and is an Open Issue, please confirm the same.



TestDAGRecovery seems unrelated to both this patch and TEZ-2673 ( as TEZ-2673 is mostly around debugging info around failures ).

For  TestDAGRecovery, please run the single test manually and look for the *logDir* under target. That should have AM and container/task logs that will shed some more light on what is the underlying issue. 

Thanks for validating the fix. I will go ahead and patch TEZ-2852 on to branch 0.7
