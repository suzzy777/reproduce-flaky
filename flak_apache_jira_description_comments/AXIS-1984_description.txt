Currently WSDL2Java assumes that the schemaLocation URI specified in an XML Schema <xs:import> or <xs:include> element is either a URL or a file path; it would be a vast improvement if it could use the Apache XML Commons project's Catalog based Resolver instead (http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/resolver/).

It is not always possible to specify a file or URL location which is constant and useable across development, test and live systems, so the ability that XML Catalogs give to map arbitrary URIs or URI prefixes to alternative paths is invaluable when creating portable and authoritative XML Schema/WSDL service definitions.

The functionality could also be usefully (but in practice less importantly) employed in <wsdl:import> elements.

Implementation should allow a root catalog to be specified on the command line (WSDL2Java), and should pick up the configured catalog(s) (<xmlcatalog> elements) from the Ant environment (axis-wsdl2java Ant task).
