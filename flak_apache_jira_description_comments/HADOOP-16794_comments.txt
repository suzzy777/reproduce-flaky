Debugging details:
When a put operation is performed without -d parameter is used, it happens in two steps. First is copying to a temporary file and then copying the temp file to the right location. The is issue is durning the copy step as an extra header "x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms" is set.
When -d parameter is used, the file is uploaded directly and in that api call this kms header is not set.

Solution: Removing the kms header from the ClonedObjectMetatData.

Steps for performing testing:
 * Create a bucket in s3 console. 
 * Create a CMK in KMS console. 
 * Update the bucket encryption configurations to use SSE-KMS and select the key created above.
 * Compile the hadoop with the patch and generate new distribution.
 * Run bin/hadoop fs -put <file> <bucket>
 * Verify the encryption key set for the <file> in s3 console. It should match with the CMK created in the KMS console.

Bucket used for testing : [https://mthakur-data.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/file2]

[~stevel@apache.org] and [[~mukund-thakur] It seems this is also happening in Hadoop 2.x. Our engineer is reporting similar issue and I'll confirm that shortly. I think we can also include the target branch 2.10.


OK, merged in to trunk...feel free to backport

SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #18019 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/18019/])

I see major backport conflicts from {{trunk}} to branch-3.2 and older branches. [~mukund-thakur] Could you provide a patch for other branches? I can help review and backport. Thanks,

[~liuml07] Create a PR [https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/1875] for branch-3.2. Please review. Thanks

Bulk update: moved all 3.3.0 non-blocker issues, please move back if it is a blocker.
